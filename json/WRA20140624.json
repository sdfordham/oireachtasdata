An interdepartmental group has been established and has met on a number of occasions. The group is to bring a report to the Government shortly which will inform decisions on the terms of reference for this Commission.<\/p><p>  My Department is participating fully as required in this process, and, at my request, the Garda authorities have been of assistance in gathering certain information in respect of issues relating to the former St. Mary's Mother and Baby Home at Tuam.  This has involved inquiries in the local area concerning the site and its history, with a view to establishing an overview of the issues and identifying relevant sources of information which may be of assistance to the Commission once established.  These inquiries have confirmed that the area has been known locally as a burial ground for children who died while resident in the home and, although unmarked, has been cared for by local residents who have placed some memorial items there.  The site in question is owned by Galway County Council, having been part of the lands on which the housing estate adjoining the site was built.<\/p><p>  As part of these inquiries, Garda&iacute; have made informal contact with two men widely reported as having discovered remains at the site while playing there as children, and both have spoken to Garda&iacute; in relation to the location and circumstances of their discovery circa 1975.  To date no records have been identified suggesting that this discovery was reported to the police or the Coroner at the time, and the account of the two men in question does not recall any such involvement.  Garda&iacute; have also made informal contact with the Bon Secours Order, as the body who managed the former Home, to establish general background information, which may be of assistance to the work of the Commission.  Garda&iacute; have also met with the local historian whose research has called attention to the deaths at the Home.<\/p><p>  While these inquiries are ongoing and should be of assistance, the Deputy will appreciate, however, that the question of initiating a criminal investigation is a matter for the Garda authorities, and my understanding is that information which would warrant such an investigation has not at this point come to light.  Furthermore, and following Garda contact with the local Coroner, who is independent in carrying out his functions, my understanding is that circumstances which would give rise to an inquiry by him under the Coroner's Act have also not arisen.  In saying this I should of course make absolutely clear that while the question of any criminal or coroner's investigation is a matter for the relevant authorities, the need to carry out a broad inquiry into the circumstances at the Tuam Home, and at Mother and Baby Homes generally, is not in question and this is precisely what the Government has resolved to do in the form of a Commission of Investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400051#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400051#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[21354\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400051#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will support legislation to introduce new rules, protocols and rules of disclosure in cases of medical negligence at birth, to avert the enormous stress and lengthy litigation being brought upon families who take such cases and to ensure that they receive money at an early stage, when it is most needed for their child; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1094","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>I am pleased to confirm to the Deputy that work at my Department and the Department of Health is ongoing in relation to the reform of aspects of the law applying to medical negligence and that this work will include the bringing forward of legislation to deal with the issues he has raised.

The facts available regarding Magdalen laundries have already been set out in detail in the McAleese report which exceeds 1,000 pages.  The women concerned have received an apology from the Taoiseach, have had the opportunity to relate their stories to both Mr McAleese and Judge Quirke and are entitled to receive a capital sum of up to &euro;100,000 depending on duration of stay as well as life long pension top up payments and access to medical services.<\/p><p>  The McAleese report did address the question of links between Mother and Baby Homes and Magdalen Laundries.

Advanced analytical and intelligence methods are applied, and proactive high-visibility checkpoints, patrols and searches are deployed, coordinated with armed response capacity to ensure that such resources are focused on key locations and periods.  In addition to these enforcement measures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also engages extensively with communities in a range of fora to address local concerns relating to crime and community safety, including the impact that organised crime can have at a community level.

This has been necessary in view of the actions of some of the protestors, many of whom are not from the area and engage in acts of public disorder as well as damage to property. The action of some of the protestors was designed not just to register their disapproval of the work going on there but to try to prevent that work proceeding.

There are a range of circumstances where this latter situation can arise including, for example, where the person&rsquo;s permission has expired and they subsequently leave the State without notifying the authorities or cannot provide documentary evidence of their departure.  The key issue is that the onus is on the person concerned to abide by the immigration laws, notify the authorities of their departure and provide documentary evidence as required.  Otherwise, the result is that a Deportation Order may be made in respect of them.<\/p><p>Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) provides for the making of a Deportation Order and also sets out the procedures to be followed where it is proposed to make such an Order against a named person. Where it is proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of a person, that person must be advised in writing to this effect and the reason(s) for the proposal must be stated. The person in question will be advised of their options, which must be exercised within a 15 working day period, and these options are (i) to leave the State voluntarily, (ii) to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or (iii) to submit written representations to the Minister setting out reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made.  In the majority of cases, persons faced with these options avail of the option referred to at (iii) above.

All such applications are considered on their individual merits. In all instances, the information and documentation submitted in support of the application is considered in great detail before a decision is made to revoke or to affirm the Deportation Order.

These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.<\/p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015. There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning through  Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes.  Other areas where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision for higher education, in the arts and in preparing prisoners for release and supporting their transition to life, and often to education, on the outside.  A top priority for the Irish Prison Service is ensuring help for those with reading and writing problems and peer mentoring programmes are currently active in all of our prisons.<\/p><p>  As well as seeking to draw on best practice in adult and further education in the community, there has been a lot of curriculum development over the years that is specific to prison circumstances, such as courses on addiction, health issues and offending behaviour. <\/p><p>  The guiding principles which underpin the prisons' work and training service are to make available, work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody aiming to give useful skills and serve the purpose of promoting rehabilitation.  Training activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical skills which will help them secure employment on release.  Vacancies are in the process of being filled by a combination of redeployment of Clerks under the Croke Park Agreement and a competition for promotion to Work Training Officer.  To date 110 Work Training Officers have been appointed and assigned to areas such as catering, laundry, industrial cleaning, industrial skills and gym.<\/p><p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled us to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification. <\/p><p>  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date. Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware records of prisoner participation in vocational training and education programmes are not maintained in such a way as to provide the information sought by the Deputy.  The manner in which records are collated does not allow us to differentiate between first-time offenders and repeat offenders.  However, from the records that are available I can inform the Deputy that figures  are compiled retrospectively and the latest available figures (07\/04\/14 - 11\/04\/14) show that an overall total of 1,789 offenders participated in Education activities which represents almost 40% of the prisoner population at that time.  <\/p><p>  Similarly an average of 1,073 prisoners engaged in vocational training activities each day in April and this represents 26% of the average prison population in that month.  It should be noted that a prisoner may participate in more than one activity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400052#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Misconduct Allegations","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400052#WRB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[26749\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400052#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will consider the request of a person (details supplied) and their legal representative to have their case included in any statutory commission of investigation that the Government establishes into Garda mishandling and malpractice arising out of the recent inquiries in this area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware from my response to his parliamentary question today (26750\/14) that the complex issues raised by the person concerned and her legal representative about this distressing and tragic case, including the request for a public inquiry, are currently under consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400052#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission Issues","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400052#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[26694\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400052#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the actions she will take in view of the content and findings of the inquiry into reports of unlawful surveillance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":79,"content":"<p>An article in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>on 9 February 2014 reported that the offices of GSOC had been targeted as part of a sophisticated surveillance operation which used Government-level technology to hack into its e-mail, Wi-Fi and phone systems.

Richard Haass and Meghan O&rsquo;Sullivan consulted widely across society in Northern Ireland last year and brought to the table a clear message from the people that they want to see the party leaders finding new, comprehensive and credible ways of dealing with legacy issues.  I agree with Dr Haass&rsquo;s assessment that there is deep and wide public support for these issues to be dealt with in a comprehensive way.  I have witnessed this at first hand during my visits to the North.  The Northern Ireland Party Leaders have individually acknowledged that there is broad agreement among the parties on the basic architecture for moving forward on each issue.  They are continuing to meet, including a meeting scheduled to take place today, with a view to closing the remaining gaps between them and for developing the practical mechanisms and related timeframe for implementation.<\/p><p>  It is in the best interests of Northern Ireland that agreement is reached now.  It is particularly important in advance of the marching season and the summer recess that politics is seen to be working in the best interests of all communities in the North.  There have been several instances over recent months where the legacy of the past has seriously disrupted political and community life in Northern Ireland.  It is clear from my contacts with business leaders that they are concerned at the broader economic and social consequences of the lack of political progress in recent months in addressing these legacy issues.<\/p><p>  In Washington DC last week, I heard genuine concern being expressed by political, business and community leaders on the need for progress in the Party Leaders talks, which the United States government regards as very important in themselves, and which they recognise are also hampering progress and decision-making across a broad range of Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly business.<\/p><p>  In my ongoing meetings and contacts with the Party Leaders and the Secretary of State, most recently on 9 June in Belfast, I have stressed the importance of securing an agreement on the outstanding issues.  I underlined that the people of Northern Ireland expect politics to deliver tangible outcomes that improve their lives.  I remain committed to doing everything possible in the time ahead to ensure that real progress is achieved.  As I said yesterday on the occasion of the award of the Tipperary Peace Prize to Dr Haass, his work last year represents a solid foundation for the agreement that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s leaders must deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400053#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Marching Season","counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400053#WRC00750"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[26854\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400053#WRC00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views regarding the upcoming marching season in\u00a0Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":135,"content":"<p>I maintain regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers MP, about the current situation in Northern Ireland, including contentious marches and the overall parades issue.  My officials in the British Irish Joint Secretariat in Belfast closely monitor the situation on the ground and maintain regular contacts with political and community leaders who work to manage and to resolve parade related difficulties.  Thanks to such community work and dialogue, the vast majority of parades pass without incident.  Last year, for example the Parades Commission dealt with over 4,000 notifications of parades, of which 146 were contentious and required Parades Commission determinations.<\/p><p>  Contentious parades in Northern Ireland give rise to annual concerns and they heighten sectarian tension at community level.  In the past, disagreements over some contentious parades have spilled over into street violence, have deepened division and have put the Police Service of Northern Ireland in harm&rsquo;s way.  There is considerable concern about the prospects for this year&rsquo;s marching season, particularly centered on the current impasse in relation to the Ardoyne\/Woodvale\/Twadell parading issue.  I welcome all the work that has been underway at community level in recent months to try to overcome the serious concerns about those contentious parade issues.  The Church led talks initiative, in particular, is to be commended.  Sustained, meaningful dialogue to resolve difficulties is the key to a peaceful and honourable resolution of these issues.<\/p><p>  While seen as a local issue, the Parades impasse in North Belfast goes to the very heart of the challenges of building support for reconciliation and a shared society in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, resolving the Ardoyne\/Woodvale\/Twadell issues through agreement is important - not only for the communities in North Belfast but for the people of the Northern Ireland more generally.  I would therefore call on all the party leaders to actively encourage and support local efforts to resolve the contentious parades problem in North Belfast.  A resolution of the parades issue is essential for politics to be seen to work and could build momentum for the early completion of the wider talks process on parades, flags, and dealing with the past.  The memory of the dreadful violence of previous summers; the memory of the harm done to PSNI and local communities; and the real damage done to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation by street violence in previous summers, makes early efforts to reach agreement in North Belfast both necessary and urgent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400053#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Issues","counter":136,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400053#WRC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[26856\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400053#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he or his Department are concerned about accusations of political bias within the PSNI; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":138,"content":"<p>The replacement of the Royal Ulster Constabulary by the Police Service of Northern Ireland in 2001 as recommended by the Patten report marked a new beginning for policing and for public confidence in policing in Northern Ireland.

The Policing Board is an independent public body made up of Political and Independent members tasked with ensuring an effective, efficient, impartial, representative and accountable police service which commands the confidence of the whole community.

The list has been prepared according to the information available to my Department and aims to be as comprehensive as possible.  There are 83 agreements on the list: 20 Multilateral agreements for which the UN Secretary General is the depositary; 16 Council of Europe agreements; 32 EU agreements; 7 Other multilateral agreements; and 8 Bilateral agreements.<\/p><p>The two-step process whereby a state will first sign an international agreement, subject to ratification, is the usual manner in which international agreements are concluded.  This interval permits states to take whatever legislative or administrative measures are required to fulfil obligations assumed under the agreement.  The signing of an agreement may be an important demonstration of a state&rsquo;s support for it, pending its ratification when in a position to do so.  The alternative would be to refrain from signing the agreement at all, which may be interpreted as a lack of support for the agreement.  In this regard, there is nothing unusual, or wrong in principle, in having some time period between signature and ratification, and the length of time required may depend on the complexities of the particular issues involved.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Article 29.6 of the Constitution provides that international agreements do not form part of the domestic law of the State unless the Oireachtas so provides through the enactment of legislation.  This is what is known as a &ldquo;dualist&rdquo; approach to international agreements.  In contrast, for some states, ratification of an international agreement automatically incorporates the terms of that agreement into its domestic law.  Such states may be in a position to ratify agreements more quickly than dualist states such as Ireland.<\/p><p>As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have an important role in relation to all international agreements entered into by Ireland.  Before a treaty may be signed, ratified or acceded to, it is necessary to obtain an authorising Government Decision.  As the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 designates the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade as the Minister responsible for external relations, all Memoranda for the Government concerning international agreements (other than International Labour Organisation Conventions) are brought by me, irrespective of their substantive content.  Where the agreement is the functional responsibility of another department, as is usually the case, the Memorandum is brought by me on behalf of the relevant Minister.  Therefore, while my Department has a central role in relation to signing and ratifying international agreements, it is often the case that the necessary legislative or administrative measures required to implement them are for the line Department responsible for the subject matter of the agreement.  Line Departments, in taking steps to ratify an agreement, will consult with my Department as the ratification process develops to ensure that important procedural steps are followed.<\/p><p>My Department annually publishes all international agreements that enter into force for Ireland in the Irish Treaty Series, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, and lays them before this House.  A notice of all agreements laid is also published in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.  I have asked my officials to ensure that a list of the international agreements which have been signed but not ratified by Ireland be published on the Department&rsquo;s website by the end of the year and updated annually. <\/p><p>List of International Agreements signed by Ireland, but not Ratified<\/p><p>[1] Multilateral Treaties deposited with the Secretary General of the United

The Minister for European Affairs Paschal Donohoe, T.D. met with Foreign Minister Fahmy, on 11 June 2014 in Athens, on the margins of the EU-League of Arab States Ministerial meeting.

Also, on 12 March 2014, the Minister for Justice wrote to the Egyptian Minister for Justice Abdel-Moneim Othman, raising the Government&rsquo;s concerns at the individual&rsquo;s situation and requesting the opportunity to speak about this case as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  I have worked with the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, to ensure maximum engagement at EU level.

At my request, Minister of State Paschal Donohoe, T.D. raised this individual&rsquo;s case in person with High Representative Ashton at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on 12 May.  High Representative Ashton had confirmed that the EU is both acutely aware of, and closely monitoring, this individual&rsquo;s situation.  The European External Action Service delegation in Cairo has raised the case during official contacts.

The Fiscal Council's analysis and recommendations are being considered by my Department, and will feed into the preparation of its updated economic and fiscal projections in the Budget.  As is my usual practice, we will be publishing a comprehensive response to this report.<\/p><p>  Firstly, it is important to note that the report stated that the fiscal stance remains conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management and that the Government is complying with the fiscal rules.  The Council recommends that there should be no deviation from the &euro;2 billion consolidation in 2015.  Let me be clear.  The Government has repeatedly said that it will do whatever is necessary to ensure that the 3% of GDP target will be met.  Ireland has consistently met or exceeded the fiscal targets to date and Budget 2015 will set out the measures necessary to achieve this goal.  The composition of Budget 2015 measures will be finalised in the context of budgetary discussions, informed by the latest economic and fiscal data.<\/p><p>  The Council also states that the Government's recently published fiscal adjustment plans for 2016-18 appear to go beyond the minimum requirements of the new fiscal framework.  The rules specify the need to make progress towards the medium term objective (MTO) of a balanced budget after taking into account the impact of the economic cycle (i.e. in structural terms).  In particular, the preventive arm sets out the requirement for an annual correction in the level of the structural balance (an improvement of 0.5 per cent per annum as a benchmark), without specifying when this position should be achieved.<\/p><p>  In contrast, the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the EMU (sometimes referred to as the 'fiscal compact') tasked the European Commission with\u00a0producing an actual\u00a0timetable\u00a0for participating Member States to achieve their MTOs.  Last summer, the Commission outlined that Ireland should achieve its MTO by 2018.  On this basis, the April 2014 Stability Programme Update set out a\u00a0path for achieving a balanced budget by 2018.  Until the 2014 Country\u00a0Specific Recommendations (CSRs) are formally\u00a0adopted by the European Council (early July), Ireland remains subject to the\u00a0requirement of meeting\u00a0the 2018 deadline.<\/p><p>  Following discussions on the necessary consistency between the fiscal compact and the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), and ahead of the formal\u00a0adoption of the 2014 CSRs, the European Commission has clarified that the\u00a0deadline for MTO achievement is not fixed but the required annual improvement in the structural balance is.  Consistent\u00a0with SGP rules, Member States not at their MTOs must improve their structural balance by at least 0.5 per cent of GDP per annum.<\/p><p>  So, in summary,\u00a0last year the requirements of the fiscal compact set out a deadline for MTO achievement, whereas\u00a0from this year onwards, the focus will be on the required fiscal effort.  Therefore, once the 2014 CSRs are formally adopted, we will no longer need to reach a balanced budget by 2018; instead, we will have to deliver the required\u00a0annual improvement in the structural balance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400053#WRC02900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Bank of Ireland Investigations","counter":166,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400053#WRC02950"},{"type":"question","counter":167,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[26587\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400053#WRC03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Financial Regulator was instructed to only investigate irregularities in payment protection schemes prior to 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"985","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":168,"content":"<p>I have been informed by the Central Bank that it conducted a review of the sale, from 1 July 2007 only, of Payment Protection Insurance by firms.

I would look upon the development of this initiative as being an aid to encouraging and facilitating the supply of new homes particularly for young families.<\/p><p>  In other jurisdictions, such as the UK and Canada, &quot;mortgage insurance&quot; markets have been developed to support bank mortgage lending, particularly to 'First Time Buyers'.  Mortgage insurance allows banks to share the risk of mortgage lending, either with the public sector or with private sector insurance companies with the aim of increasing bank lending in general or to target groups.<\/p><p>  My Department is committed, under\u00a0'Construction 2020 A Strategy for a Renewed\u00a0Construction Sector', to examine the concept of a mortgage insurance scheme and how it might benefit new housing completions in the Irish market.  The objective of any scheme would be to ensure adequate availability of mortgage finance on affordable terms for new completions, particularly for 'First Time Buyers', as the economy recovers.  In doing so we would aim to provide the certainty needed to support greater levels of investment in new housing, with the associated benefits for the construction sector and ultimately for the consumer.<\/p><p>  As the Construction Strategy mentions, my Department is undertaking\u00a0an economic impact analysis which will assess the impact such a scheme would have on the Irish housing market, taking into consideration time limits, targeting 'First Time Buyers' or owner occupiers and focussing on new housing.  I would like to assure\u00a0the Deputy\u00a0that the points he raised\u00a0will be considered during the analysis process.  The analysis will draw lessons from mortgage insurance initiatives undertaken in other countries and will include questions as to the appropriateness of a price cap as well as regional or geographic restrictions.

The first is the global rate of tax which is paid by multinational companies who operate across a number of jurisdictions.\u00a0 This is a 'blended' rate which takes into account the amount of tax charged across all of the countries that a company trades in and not just Ireland. <\/p><p>The extremely low effective rate figures are sometimes quoted and attributed to Ireland are based on a flawed premise.\u00a0 The figures are estimated by dividing the amount of Irish tax paid by a total profit figure that includes substantial profits made by companies that are not tax resident in Ireland.\u00a0 They are running together the profits earned by group companies in Ireland and in other jurisdictions and incorrectly suggesting that Irish tax does or should apply to both.  Ireland cannot tax profits that are properly attributable to other jurisdictions.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The ability of some multinationals to lower their world-wide rate of tax using international structures reflects the global context in which Ireland and indeed all countries operate.\u00a0\u00a0The best way to effectively address this issue is for countries to work together at the international level and the appropriate action is being considered in this regard by the OECD as part of their project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and Ireland is participating fully in this process.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The second issue is the effective rate of tax applying in individual countries.\u00a0 Clearly, the domestic rate of tax paid in Ireland is within the control of the Irish tax system and Ireland is responsible for the amount of Irish corporation tax that is charged here.\u00a0 I want to re-emphasise that all companies operating in Ireland - domestic businesses and multinationals - are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities here. A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits, as well as certain petroleum, mining and land-dealing activities, and chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.<\/p><p>Some other countries have a high headline rate of corporation which is then supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs which reduce the overall rate of tax paid.\u00a0 By contrast, the approach in Ireland is transparent: we have a competitive headline rate of corporation tax which is applied to a broad base.  We therefore have only a small number of corporation tax incentives in Ireland, and we make sure that those we do have are specifically targeted.\u00a0 They are focussed on the creation of employment and on areas of innovation.\u00a0 These reliefs are evaluated on a regular basis to ensure that they give the taxpayer value for money.<\/p><p>My Department recently published a technical paper to provide clarity to the D&aacute;il about the seemingly conflicting figures and methodologies.\u00a0 The Department commissioned an external and independent academic to ensure that this piece of work was as objective as possible.\u00a0 This report is published on the Department's website and can be viewed at the following link:<\/p><p>.  <\/p><p>Based on data from the Central Statistics Office (using the &quot;Net Operating Surplus&quot;) and the Revenue Commissioners (using the &quot;Taxable Income&quot;), this report highlighted that since 2003 the effective corporate tax rate has averaged 10.9% and 10.7% respectively.  While this percentage is lower than the 12.5% headline rate, this can be attributed to the availability of the small number of reliefs I referred to earlier such as the R&amp;amp;D tax credit, which was the subject of a comprehensive review last year and which was found to give value for money for the Irish taxpayer.<\/p><p>Therefore, I am not in a position to introduce a minimum 'effective rate' in Ireland in the way the Deputy has suggested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400055#WRE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":274,"content":"<p>Question No. 165 answered with Question No. 161.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":275,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400055#WRE01750"},{"type":"question","counter":276,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[27306\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400055#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the proposal in a submission (details supplied) to make tax credits refundable; and the projected cost to the Exchequer of establishing the necessary administrative system to facilitate the refund of tax credits.","asker":"1190","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":277,"content":"<p>The Deputy is advised that the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare (AGTSW) are considering a range of tax and social welfare issues, with a view to increasing the incentives for individuals to return to work.

This child centred approach is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism.<\/p><p>  My Department has not in the past developed guidelines relating to the transitioning of children from ABA environments to non-ABA mainstream environments. However, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is currently preparing Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders. The NCSE has advised my Department that the Policy Advice will be delivered in the spring of 2015 and will draw upon findings gathered from an extensive consultation process which has already commenced. Many studies have been conducted on the value of ABA and if the Deputy is aware of specific research on transitioning which she feels would be of benefit to NCSE in the preparation of the advice she should bring it to their attention directly.<\/p><p>  I am aware that a number of parents continue to hold a view that my Department should support ABA where it is shown to be successful. As I have already stated, my Department supports the use of ABA, but not where it is exclusive of other interventions.  I expect that the NCSE final report will reflect the broadest possible range of views and provide recommendations which will assist the development of policy for future years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400056#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Administration","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400056#WRF00750"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[26624\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400056#WRF00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"how the tendering system introduced by Bus &Eacute;ireann for its school routes works; if there has been any consultation with smaller bus operators regarding this system; the measures in place to ensure all bus routes are divided equally among bus operators; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":319,"content":"<p>Bus &Eacute;ireann, which operates the School Transport Scheme on behalf of my Department, has advised that the tendering procedure used for the provision of school transport services is a competitive procurement process conducted in accordance with the negotiated procedure under Directive 2004\/17\/EC.

The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive capitation grant assistance to provide for secretarial (and\/or caretaking) services. Within the capitation grant schemes, the level and extent of services provided is a matter for the school authorities who, through the discretion afforded under the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for secretarial services as resources permit. My Department does not stipulate any rules concerning how secretarial services are to be obtained by the school. It is a matter for the individual school to decide how best to apply the funding to suit the school's particular needs.

The VECs were dissolved on 1 July last and were replaced with Education and Training Boards (ETBs).<\/p><p>  The new ETBs will strengthen locally managed education and enhance the scale of local education and training.  This represents a major component of the public service transformation agenda. The new configuration has facilitated exciting new provisions including the establishment of SOLAS, the dissolution of F&Aacute;S and has paved the way for the transfer of training functions to the newly formed Education and Training Boards.  On 1st January of this year, 7 training centres transferred to 4 ETBs and in July of this year a further 12 training centres will transfer to 7 ETBs, including Longford and Westmeath ETB.  In October 2011, I decided on the headquarter locations for the new ETBs.  In relation to the Longford and Westmeath Education and Training Board, I decided that the headquarters would be in Mullingar.<\/p><p>  In arriving at this decision, I considered a range of factors including the need to ensure that the location of an ETB headquarters will, to the greatest extent possible, facilitate staff redeployment under a redeployment scheme within the context of the Croke Park Agreement and the need to operate at lowest cost having regard to the accommodation available in existing locations.  In terms of these criteria, I was aware that redeployment of staff from Longford to Mullingar is possible under the Croke Park agreement.  The offices in Longford have remained open and staff formerly employed in County Longford VEC headquarters have not yet been redeployed to Mullingar.  I expect that the offices in Longford will remain open for some time and that the approach to redeployment will be measured and considered. I am satisfied that, properly managed, the move will positively impact on education services offered by the new ETB.<\/p><p>  Since the offices in Longford have remained open and staff have not been redeployed to Mullingar following the establishment of the ETB in July last year, no savings have accrued from the decision to locate the VEC headquarters in Mullingar, County Westmeath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400057#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Curriculum","counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400057#WRG00450"},{"type":"question","counter":379,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[26921\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400057#WRG00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding the removal of CSPE from State examinations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":380,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[27005\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400057#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason civic, social and political education will be removed as a compulsory State examinable subject in the new junior cycle curriculum (details supplied) as it will result in the demise in the civic responsibility and involvement  of our future youth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[27026\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400057#WRG00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding the future of the CSPE course as part of the junior certificate cycle; his plans to remove the compulsory status of this subject; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1178","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":382,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[27144\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400057#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the measures his Department is taking to ensure that citizenship and human rights education is a priority under the new CSPE junior cycle curriculum at post-primary level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1026","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":383,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203, 211, 213 and 215 together.<\/p><p>  In the context of the implementation of the new Framework for Junior Cycle the only subjects that will be &quot;compulsory&quot; are English, Mathematics and Irish. This decision has been taken to give schools the flexibiilty to develop their Junior Cycle programme mindful of the educational needs of their own students and mindful of the principles, statements of learning and key skills as set out in the Framework. <\/p><p>  Education about active citizenship and the promotion of human rights issues are an integral component of the new Framework for Junior Cycle.  For example, one of the 24 'Statements of Learning', that encompass the key knowledge and skills that students will develop during their junior cycle, requires that all students will &quot;value what it means to be an active citizen with rights and responsibilities in local and wider context&quot;.  In addition, the 8 key skills which underpin the new Framework for Junior Cycle, include &quot;working with others&quot; whereby students should realise and experience how they can &quot;contribute to making the world a better place&quot;.  As junior cycle students will experience the statements of learning and key skills, it is expected that education for active citizenship and education about human rights and responsibilities will continue to be an important part of the new Junior Cycle. <\/p><p>  I recently approved a new short course in CSPE that has been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).  This short course will be available to schools to implement, from this September, should they wish to do so as part of their Junior Cycle programme or they may continue to offer the current syllabus. Schools will choose from one or the other for the up-coming academic year 2014\/2015.  This programme is in fact designed for 100 hours of teaching compared to less than 70 hours for the existing CSPE syllabus.  The new short course aims to inform, inspire, empower and enable young people to participate as active citizens in contemporary society at local, national and global levels based on an understanding of human rights and social responsibilities. <\/p><p>  As with Junior Cycle, education about active citizenship and human rights issues are also reflected at Senior Cycle.  As part of transition year, students are afforded the opportunity to further interrogate some of the themes encountered in CSPE at Junior Cycle.  This is facilitated by the availability of resources and materials that have been developed by as number of NGOs, including Amnesty International, for use by transition year pupils. I have also indicated my intention to introduce 'Politics and Society' as a new optional Leaving Certificate subject.  One of the objectives of the draft syllabus, which has been developed by the NCCA, is to develop 'a sense of care for others and a respect for and a valuing of diversity in all areas of human life within the parameters of human rights principles'.  In addition, the draft syllabus is structured around four key areas.  One of these areas is 'Active Citizenship'.  The Politics and Society subject will be made available to schools once the NCCA has advised my Department on a number of outstanding issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400057#WRG00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":384,"content":"<p>Question No. 204 answered with Question No. 202.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Staff","counter":385,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400057#WRG01050"},{"type":"question","counter":386,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[26945\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400057#WRG01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding college lecturers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":387,"content":"<p>Individual higher education institutions have autonomous responsibility for the management of their staff resources.

Therefore, I have no plans to change the method by which valuations are assessed for rating as such a radical move would represent a significant\u00a0departure from the long-standing practice of levying rates solely by reference to property values.<\/p><p>  It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a source of revenue, and the rating system generally, are deeply embedded in the local government system. Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.\u00a0 All rates collected within a local authority area are spent exclusively in delivering the public services which are required locally to create the environment in which businesses can prosper.

Rates are a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.\u00a0 A system having regard to economic factors on an ongoing basis would create uncertainty by providing for continuous change to the valuation base. Such a system would not provide a stable basis for funding local government and would require significant additional resources to operate.<\/p><p>  In recent years, local authorities have been asked by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to exercise restraint in setting the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) and they have responded positively in this regard.\u00a0 The Government recognises that these are difficult economic times for many businesses.\u00a0It will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration and\u00a0it is\u00a0determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency, and contain and reduce costs in the local government sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400058#WRH03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gender Balance Issues","counter":476,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400058#WRH03050"},{"type":"question","counter":477,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[27396\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400058#WRH03100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if his Department has reviewed its gender equality policy as published in 2001; his views that a policy published 13 years ago should be the subject of a fundamental review to assess its effectiveness; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":478,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[27397\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400058#WRH03200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if his Department has reviewed its policy on diversity in the Civil Service as first published in 2002; his views that a policy published 12 years ago should be the subject of a fundamental review to assess its effectiveness; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":479,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 239 and 240 together.<\/p><p>  My Department is responsible for the Civil Service\u00a0Gender Equality Policy and the Diversity Policy.\u00a0 Substantial progress has been made in relation to the objectives set out in the Civil Service Gender Equality Policy and the Diversity Policy which were reviewed in 2006, in particular, in relation to the specific targets set by Government to address the gender imbalance at higher levels and to provide information on the work being done at Departmental and Office level to address equality issues.  Subsequently the policy approach in this area has been guided and informed \u00a0by key national strategies in the area of gender equality.<\/p><p>  My Department continues to review our targets on a regular basis, in line with the targets included in the National Women's Strategy 2007-2016.\u00a0\u00a0In that Strategy the original\u00a0targets\u00a0for the percentage of women in the grades of Assistant Principal (33.3%) and Principal Officer (27%) in the Civil Service have already been well exceeded for both grades. At the end of 2013, the female percentage in the Assistant Principal grade was 43% and the female percentage in the Principal Officer grade was 35%. Earlier this year, the Strategy set new targets for the Civil Service of 40% women in both grades and while we are already at the target for the Assistant Principal grade we will continue to work to achieve the target in the Principal Officer grade.<\/p><p>  A further key strategy in gender equality is the wide availability of flexible working practices.\u00a0 In this regard work-life balance arrangements in the Civil Service are among the best available options provided by Irish employers, particularly when considered in tandem with annual leave and other provisions.\u00a0 Civil servants continue to have access to a number of flexible working arrangements including flexi-time, work-sharing arrangements, the shorter working year scheme and career breaks.<\/p><p>  The Civil Service Gender Equality Policy is underpinned by current equality legislation and requires individual Departments to set strategic objectives and equality goals in each Department's Strategy Statement, including goals for increasing women's representation, particularly at the higher management levels. The inclusion of such goals in each Department's Strategy Statement is a key element in the achievement of gender equality in the Civil Service.<\/p><p>  My officials also engage on a regular basis with the \u00a0Unions through the Equality sub committee of General Council to discuss matters relating to equality generally, including\u00a0both\u00a0the Gender and Diversity Policies.

The report was prepared to provide analysis, insights, learnings and guidance to SMEs no matter where in the world they operate.  The Mazars report goes on to explore what it takes to achieve levels of superior performance, to compete in the market place and effectively stand out from the crowd. <\/p><p>  There are 21 million SMEs across the EU, 92% of which are micro enterprises.  Some of the key findings of the study relate to building financial resilience and ensuring SMEs look beyond local or regional markets.  The Deputy will be aware that this Government is maintaining its focus on assisting our SMEs to establish, scale and export, with a view to driving economic recovery and creating jobs across the country.  <\/p><p>  SMEs have a critical role to play in both our domestic economy and in international markets and that is why almost all of the actions contained in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 will impact on the SME sector generally or specific groups of SMEs.  Actions around access to finance, the skills agenda, support for research and innovation, support for management development and other capacity building measures are set out in the Action Plan.  Sector specific actions covering food and drink, retail, construction, tourism, creative services, eHealth and the Green Economy aim to provide new opportunities for SMEs to win business both here and abroad.<\/p><p>  Just some of the measures introduced by this Government to assist SMEs to date, include the establishment of the Local Enterprise Offices; improving access to finance through the Credit Guarantee Scheme and the Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme, and the establishment later this year of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland; the development of an online tool which details the different government supports available to SMEs; supporting a pilot SME financial capability programme and supporting SMEs in developing an online presence which is vital in order to maximise their export potential.  It is my intention to shortly publish a National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement which will complement the existing business support initiatives in order to ensure that the operating environment is more coherent, responsive and conductive to entrepreneurship.<\/p><p>  The hard work undertaken by this Government has already begun to bear some fruit with domestic demand showing signs of growth in the past year and our competitiveness rankings continuing to improve from 24 in 2011 to 15 in 2014, according to IMD's World Competitiveness Yearbook.  In addition Forbes magazine recently named Ireland as the best country in the world in which to do business.<\/p><p>  Finally I wish to point out that much of the information relied upon by Mazars in their Report was contained in the Small Business Act Profile for Ireland for 2013, which scores each Member State in the European Union on its delivery of the European Small Business Act.  In 2013 Ireland was found to be in positive territory in relation to 9 of the 10 measures identified by the Commission in the implementation of the Small Business Act.

To this end, the enterprise agencies and other relevant players have been tasked with working to enhance the competitiveness of manufacturing in Ireland by working with companies and implementing the recommendations in the Strategy. That sector lost 50,000 jobs in the years up to 2010 but at the end of 2013, there were a total of 215,900 people directly employed in the sector, which was an increase of 10,000 on the numbers identified at the time the Strategy was published.  This sector also supports a similar number of jobs indirectly. The Strategy does not identify specific location around the country for the expansion of the sector. In addition to that Strategy, I also initiated another, complementary,  research project on issues relating to skills needs, and that report entitled &ldquo;<i>The Future Skills Needs of the Manufacturing Sector to 2020<\/i>&rdquo; was published by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs\/Forf&aacute;s at the same time.  Implementation of this report is also in hand <\/p><p>A particularly attractive feature of manufacturing in Ireland is the fact that many of the present jobs are not in the main urban areas, but dispersed into regional locations, thereby providing a valuable employment focus in areas where alternative jobs are scarce. The further development of the sector will, of course, build on this key feature.<\/p><p>Key tasks from both reports have been incorporated into the<i>Action Plan for Jobs, <\/i>which includes a series of actions to develop the sector.  It is also relevant that the <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2014<\/i>includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.  I intend that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, focusing on the Midlands region, and involving the agencies under the remit of this Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices.  The objective is to enhance synergies between the agencies and their client companies and build on the competitive strengths of the region to maximise the potential for job creation.  The role which other public bodies in the region can play in working towards this objective will also be examined as the project develops.  My aim is that this framework will serve as a model for other regions of the country.<\/p><p>In addition, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s current 5 year strategy &quot;Horizon 2020&quot; expires at the end of 2014 and the agency is currently in the process of developing a new strategy from 2015 onwards.

Many countries are continuing to develop fiscal policy tools to promote investment in intellectual assets.  We are aware that other countries have introduced patent box schemes, including the UK. The general objective of such schemes is to provide a lower rate of tax on income derived from patents and other intellectual assets that are developed and commercially exploited by companies, generally by deducting or excluding a certain percentage of income from the tax base.  It is understood that the EU Commission is currently reviewing the scheme.  <\/p><p>  In considering the merits of introducing a patent box scheme in Ireland, it is important to bear in mind that countries which have introduced such schemes have corporation tax rates that are significantly higher than our general 12.5% corporation tax rate for trading income.  Alongside the 12.5% rate, Ireland provides attractive incentives to encourage R&amp;amp;D and the creation and exploitation of intellectual property, including a 25% tax credit for R&amp;amp;D expenditure. In addition, Ireland has a comprehensive capital allowances regime for expenditure on the provision of intangible assets for use in trading activities.

This Round covered extensive technical discussion on a broad range of issues including regulatory issues, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, government procurement, intellectual property rights, electronic commerce and telecommunications, environment, labour, small and medium-sized enterprises, and energy and raw materials.  Some discussion has already started on the text of an agreement in relation to helping SMEs, technical barriers to trade and on competition. <\/p><p>Negotiations on TTIP can be summarised as covering three broad areas:<\/p><p>The first is <b>market access<\/b>, for goods, services, and public procurement.  The first tariff offers, that is, the immediate or phased elimination of import tariffs on an extensive list of goods, were exchanged earlier this year, and I expect that, over the next few weeks there will be further work and negotiations to extend the range of tariff free trade that can take place once TTIP comes into effect. On services, I understand that the US tabled its first offer last week, and Member States will meet shortly to discuss what has been proposed by the U.S. The Commission expects that the EU&rsquo;s first offer on services will be ready soon. Naturally there is an important level of confidentiality about the detail of both sides&rsquo; negotiating position, but I am hopeful that the greatest level of market access can be achieved for our services exporters and for those looking to penetrate the very large U.S. public procurement market.<\/p><p>The second area covered by the talks is <b>&ldquo;rules&rdquo;<\/b>, on trade facilitation (EU and US customs systems), state-owned enterprises (these should operate on commercial lines), on raw materials and energy (EU is looking for access to US oil\/gas exports that are currently restricted), and on labour and the environment issues (no weakening of standards\/protections). Coming to agreement on these will also serve to set the standards for other Free Trade Agreements with trading partners, reduce the complexity for small companies to comply many standards and market regulations, and regulate markets in an open and transparent manner.<\/p><p>The third most difficult and complex, but most important aspect of the negotiations, is <b>reducing regulatory burdens, <\/b>which will involve a multiplicity of sectoral regulations.  In particular, areas of regulation such as financial services, environment, and health and public safety are important here, where there are legitimate but in many cases unfounded concerns about possible lowering of regulatory standards.  In fact, both the EU and the US are equally committed to the retention of high standards that serve to protect consumers. The objective is to address differences in standards between our two economies while at all times maintaining the high levels of health, safety, environmental and other protection that is reflected in EU legislation.  <\/p><p>Progress in respect of regulation, through harmonisation, mutual recognition or convergence, is the most important area, as the result of studies show it will yield the most net gains. The Commission&rsquo;s impact assessment suggests that between two thirds and four fifths of the gains from a future agreement would come from cutting red tape and having more coordination between regulators. It is important to see this as a two part issue: the process of how regulation is enacted, and the sector specific solutions being negotiated.  How regulations are made needs to be more transparent, with regulators deepening relationships in order to address emerging issues together such as setting standards for new technologies. Regulators are also discussing how to reduce the cost of meeting existing standards without affecting the levels of protection afforded by them. <\/p><p>In addition, real progress on issues like car safety standards, ending double inspections at pharmaceutical and medical device plants, should, over time, reduce costs for business, regulators and consumers. It is important to note that while regulatory aspects are one of the main elements of the TTIP negotiations, there is nothing in the negotiations that should prevent or undermine the rights of both sides to regulate, and the level of regulatory protection on both sides, be it environment, food, consumer safety, will not be lessened.<\/p><p>As regards investment protection, the public consultation launched by the European Commission last March on the investment protection provisions of a future Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, is still underway and will run until 6 July.  All stakeholders have the opportunity to respond to this consultation, so that specific interests and concerns on investor protection and settlement of related disputes are well understood by the European Commission, and can be used to better define the EU&rsquo;s approach to investor protection in the TTIP negotiations.  The public consultation can be accessed at .  Further information on the negotiations, including background documents, are available on the European Commission&rsquo;s TTIP website.   <\/p><p>At the fifth round of negotiations and as in all previous negotiating rounds, both negotiating teams maintained close dialogue with a large number of representatives of the academic community, consumer groups, labour unions, environmental groups, farmers and employers. The negotiators met with over 300 representatives of civil society. These discussions and briefings have become an integral part of the EU&rsquo;s negotiating approach to TTIP, both during each round and also between each round, so that as much information as possible can be given to interest groups.<\/p><p>My Department recently engaged international expertise to examine the economic and other impacts TTIP and related potential opportunities. The focus of this study will be to identify key areas and sectors of the economy that will be impacted by the TTIP. This work will help to inform our input to the Commission&rsquo;s negotiating position and to identify appropriate policy responses to be deployed to maximise the potential of this historic agreement and provide an assessment of the longer term implications for enterprise policy.<\/p><p>I hosted a Conference in Dublin Castle on 20 June to look at the opportunities for Ireland from the TTIP and to bring together at political and senior executive level, Oireachtas members, representatives of various economic actors, Government Departments, Agencies and Regulators, in order to explore opportunities that lie ahead for Ireland.  I will continue to look for an agreement that is comprehensive and balanced and one that delivers real trade and economic potential for our economy. In this context I recognise the need to minimise the impact of trade liberalisation and market opening on sensitive areas of the economy and will continue to express our concerns that any agreement respects our broad trade interests and especially those of the Agriculture sector. <\/p><p>I understand that the next negotiating round is scheduled to take place from 14-18 July in Brussels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400059#WRJ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":528,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400059#WRJ02200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":527,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400059#WRJ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":528,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[26647\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400059#WRJ02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the steps her Department is taking to encourage persons with blindness into employment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":529,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[26640\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400059#WRJ02300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the supports provided by her Department to those who suffer from blindness; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":530,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 and 264 together.<\/p><p>  The Department provides a range of income and work-related supports for people with disabilities, including people with blindness.

The sustainability of the wider system is a particular concern because of the demographic issues Ireland faces, the associated increases in pension (and other age related) costs, varying investment losses and the deterioration in the public finances since the recession. <\/p><p>  The National Pensions Framework was published in March 2010 and provided a framework for long term pension reform. It encompassed consideration of all aspects of pension reform including the State pension, supplementary occupational pensions, private pensions and public sector pensions. Development of the framework was informed by a range of views provided during the Green Paper consultation process.  These reforms are designed to enhance the sustainability of the system overall and ensure that people&rsquo;s income in retirement is protected. <\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Framework, it became necessary to further consider pension reform given the economic difficulties and deterioration in the public finances. In this regard, and at my request, in 2012 the Government engaged the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to conduct an independent review of long term pensions policy in Ireland.  This review was published in April 2013 and encompasses the totality of pension provision in Ireland &ndash; State, private, occupational and public sector. The issues of sustainability, adequacy, modernity and equity were central to this review. Whilst endorsing pension policy reforms undertaken to date, the report makes a number of recommendations for future reform.  Its key recommendation is to improve the adequacy of pensions by increasing coverage in the funded part of the pensions system through a universal mandatory or quasi-mandatory employment based pension system. <\/p><p>  In this regard, you will be aware the Programme for Government includes a commitment to reforming the pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers. I have previously stated that a soft-mandatory approach such as that envisaged by an auto-enrolment scheme, using scale to achieve greater cost efficiencies for the member, is a very proactive way in which we can increase supplementary pension coverage, though it is recognised that introduction of such an initiative would be best supported by a more favourable economic environment than is currently the case. <\/p><p>  In relation to the State pension, recent reforms to the pension system include a gradual increase in State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition). In January 2014, State pension age was standardised at age 66 with the cessation of State pension transition. The State pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028. These reforms were introduced in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.<\/p><p>  Reforms will continue with the current PRSI system and, as highlighted by the OECD, to strengthen the link between social insurance contributions and benefits received.  In this regard, a number of significant reforms have already been introduced and further reforms are scheduled for the years ahead.  From September 2012, new rate bands for State pension were introduced.  These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.  With effect from April 2012, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions.  It is also planned to introduce a &ldquo;total contributions approach&rdquo; to determine eligibility for a State pension. The level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life. The proposed date for the introduction of a move to a total contributions approach is 2020, but this may be subject to change. <\/p><p>  Arising from changing demographics, policy reform will continue to support longer working lives and to focus on the need to provide for sustainable and adequate pensions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400059#WRJ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":537,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400059#WRJ02850"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[27246\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400059#WRJ02900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding inclusive rights-based gender recognition for transsexual people aged 16 and over to have their name legally recognised; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":539,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[27247\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400059#WRJ03000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding inclusive rights-based gender recognition for transsexual persons; if they will be required to divorce from their spouse in order to have their gender recognised; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":540,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 260 and 261 together.<\/p><p>The General Scheme of the Gender Recognition Bill was published on 17 July 2013, following Cabinet approval.  The General Scheme of the Bill was then referred for pre-legislative scrutiny to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection.  Officials from the Department, representative groups and legal and medical experts participated in hearings held by the Committee in October 2013.  The Committee&rsquo;s Report was published in January 2014.<\/p><p>I gave careful consideration to the Committee&rsquo;s Report and, following Cabinet approval, on 17 June 2014 I published the Revised General Scheme of the Gender Recognition Bill 2014.  The Bill<i><\/i>provides for the recognition of the acquired gender of transgender people who are not married or in a civil partnership. The legislation will also facilitate persons with intersex conditions.<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Once the legislation is enacted, it will mean that a person will have their acquired gender fully recognised for all purposes, <\/font>including dealings with the State, public bodies, and civil and commercial society. <font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> This will be done through the issuing of a gender recognition certificate by the Department of Social Protection. <\/font>The person would <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">then be able to apply for a new birth certificate. They <\/font>would be entitled to marry a person of the opposite gender or enter a civil partnership with a person of the same gender.  The Bill includes a provision that a person aged 16 or 17 years may, with parent\/guardian consent, apply for a Court order exempting them from the requirement that an applicant for gender recognition must be 18 years or more. This application must be accompanied by confirmation from the treating physician and an independent physician that the person is sufficiently mature to make the application. <\/p><p>The introduction of gender recognition legislation raises complex and challenging Constitutional issues on marriage. In the context of this Bill, these were the subject of lengthy deliberation by the Attorney General and, subsequently, were carefully considered by Government before it approved the General Scheme of the Bill. As a result, one of the provisions of the proposed legislation is a requirement that in order to obtain a gender recognition certificate, a person must not be in a subsisting marriage. Similar considerations apply in relation to civil partnership.<\/p><p>It is fully acknowledged that the requirement to be single will be disappointing for those transgender persons who wish to remain married and have their acquired gender recognised. However, the Constitutional position that there is an impediment to legislating in such a way as to give rise to same-sex marriage requires that, under the proposed legislation, a person seeking recognition of their acquired gender must be single. If the planned referendum on same-sex marriage is approved by the public the obstacle will be removed and the legislation can be widened to include persons who are married or in a civil partnership.<\/p><p>The Revised General Scheme of the Bill has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting with the aim of the legislation being published later in the year and enacted as soon as possible after that <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400059#WRJ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Data","counter":541,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400059#WRJ03150"},{"type":"question","counter":542,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[26603\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400059#WRJ03200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to assist persons who cannot pay their rents; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":543,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[26797\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400059#WRJ03300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the current rent supplement maximum limits per geographic area; if available, the percentage of the average rental charged this supplement covers in each area; if there are any plans to review the amounts payable in areas such as Dublin, in view of the increase in rents in this region; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":544,"qnumday":295,"qnumall":"[27137\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400059#WRJ03400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding rent supplement payments for families (details supplied) as rent levels in parts of County Wicklow are on par with Dublin without payments reflecting the true cost rental accommodation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1184","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":545,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 262, 277 and 295 together.<\/p><p>The Government has provided over &euro;344 million for the rent supplement scheme in 2014, the purpose of which is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources. There are currently approximately 76,000 rent supplement recipients.  All prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, particularly in urban areas, are now finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties. <\/p><p>In view of these supply difficulties, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive in conjunction with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations have agreed a protocol with the Department so that families at risk of losing existing private rented accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf.  While there are no plans to extend this arrangement to other local authority areas at this time, I can assure the Deputies that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that the accommodation needs of families are met. Staff in the Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service have discretionary powers to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant, for example, when dealing with applicants who are homeless or who are at risk of losing their tenancy. Such cases are examined on a case by case basis having regard to the situation presented. <\/p><p>The current maximum monthly rent limits are provided in the tabular statement.

This review will involve a comprehensive analysis of information from a range of sources including rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), the Central Statistics Office rental indices and websites advertising rental properties. The Department is also seeking the views from a number of stakeholders in this area including the local staff administering the scheme, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and non-Government organisations such as Threshold, Focus Ireland and the Society of St Vincent de Paul.<\/p><p><b>Maximum Monthly Rent Levels from

The cost of the OFP scheme was &euro;935 million in 2013 and is estimated to be &euro;863 million in 2014.  Both the OFP maximum personal rate for the parent (&euro;188 per week) and the increase for each additional qualified child (&euro;29.80) remain untouched since 2011.  An OFP recipient can also earn up to an average of &euro;425 per week and still receive the OFP payment.  <\/p><p>  The OFP scheme has played an important role in providing income support to lone parents since its introduction in 1997.  However, in the past, this income support was passive in nature, with little systematic engagement being made by the State with recipients.  This engendered long-term social welfare dependency and associated poverty among one-parent families.  Despite significant levels of State spending on OFP the results have been poor in terms of tackling poverty and social exclusion rates among lone parent families who continue to experience higher rates of &lsquo;consistent poverty&rsquo; in comparison to the population generally.<\/p><p>  The reforms to the OFP scheme that were introduced in Budgets 2011, 2012, and 2013, aim to address these issues.  They aim to provide the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to escape inter-generational poverty and joblessness, to participate in education and training, to develop their skills set and by entering the workforce to attain financial independence for both themselves and their families.  The reforms to the OFP scheme also aim to bring Ireland&rsquo;s support for lone parents in line with international provisions &ndash; where there is a general movement away from long-term and passive income support.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, introduced changes to the OFP scheme, including the phased reduction of the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which a recipient&rsquo;s payment ceases to 7 years from 2014 for new entrants and from 2015 for existing recipients.  Transitional arrangements will apply during the period between 2013 and 2015, depending on the date that a recipient first claimed the OFP payment. By 2015, the maximum age limit of the youngest child will be 7 years for all OFP recipients.  Special Provisions exist for customers who are in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) and, also, for those who are recently bereaved. These savers can extend payment of the OFP beyond the maximum age limit threshold for these customers.<\/p><p>  As an additional support for previous OFP recipients with young children, the JA transitional arrangement was introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2013.  This caters for OFP recipients who lose their entitlement to the OFP payment from 4 July, 2013, onwards, who have a youngest child aged under 14 years, and who are entitled to the JA payment. These customers are exempt from the JA conditions that require them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work, and also, from having to prove unemployment. They can work part-time without restrictions and still receive the JA transitional payment &ndash; subject to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance means test. <\/p><p>  OFP recipients affected by the age reform are supported by the Department to transition to other social welfare income support payments as appropriate.  These include the family income supplement (FIS), the carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) payment, the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) payment and the JA transitional arrangement.  The Department engages with these customers well in advance of their payment ending to support them through this change and to ensure that they continue to receive social welfare income support as appropriate.  <\/p><p>  OFP customers leaving the scheme, who are also in receipt of Family Income Supplement, will be moved to an increased Family Income Supplement payment.  OFP customers leaving the scheme, who are also in receipt of a half rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payment, will be moved to a full-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payment.  The majority of customers who do not fall into this category can apply for the JA payment or the JA transitional arrangement. Applications for these income support payments are expedited for these customers.  <\/p><p>  Previous OFP recipients who avail of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, including the JA transitional arrangement, are required to engage with the Department&rsquo;s activation service where they are provided with access to a range of educational and employment supports to increase their skills and move them into the labour market.  As such, lone parents are now obliged to engage in education, training, and employment programmes in order to retain their social welfare income support payment.  This is a significant reform for lone parents as it is the first time that this cohort have access to the Department&rsquo;s full activation process and services to assist them to make their way towards employment and financial independence.  Lone parents who do not engage in the activation process will be subjected to the same penalty rates and disallowances as every other jobseeker.  There are no plans to review these reforms to the OFP scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400060#WRK00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Status","counter":566,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400060#WRK00550"},{"type":"question","counter":567,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[26675\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400060#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":568,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 26 May 2014, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.

Whilst endorsing pension policy reforms undertaken to date, the report also makes a number of recommendations for future reform in the key parameters of Irish State, occupational and private pension schemes and outlines options for more profound structural reforms of the retirement income system.  In considering these alternatives, the OECD highlighted that it should be kept in mind that each of the national schemes and reforms discussed in the review was adopted in a specific national economic, social and political setting and that there is no blueprint for future reform which Ireland could take off-the-shelf and implement directly.  As was expressed by the OECD, any solution has to fit the Irish situation. <\/p><p>  A key recommendation made by the OECD is to improve the adequacy and sustainability of pensions by increasing coverage in the supplementary part of the pensions system through a universal mandatory or quasi-mandatory employment-based pension system and\/or through improving existing financial incentives. This recommendation is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to reform Ireland&rsquo;s pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers.<\/p><p>  The fundamental policy rationale in this area is to ensure that those who do not currently have a supplementary pension are assisted and encouraged towards having one.  As I have previously stated, a soft-mandatory approach such as that envisaged by an auto-enrolment scheme, using scale to achieve greater cost efficiencies for the member, has been proven a successful and proactive way in which we can increase supplementary pension coverage.  However, it is recognised that introduction of any such initiative would be best supported by a more favourable economic environment than is currently the case.  <\/p><p>  With respect to OECD recommendations about Defined Benefit schemes, legislation has recently been introduced to provide for minimum guarantees for scheme members in the case of double insolvencies.  This legislation removes the absolute priority order for pensioners and facilitates a greater degree of risk sharing across all members of DB schemes.<\/p><p>  In relation to the State pension, reforms will continue with the current PRSI system and, as highlighted by the OECD, to strengthen the link between social insurance contributions and benefits received.  In this regard, a number of significant reforms have already been introduced and further reforms are scheduled for the years ahead. <\/p><p>  Firstly, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension were introduced.  These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.  <\/p><p>  Secondly, with effect from April 2012, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions.  <\/p><p>  Thirdly, it is planned to introduce a &ldquo;total contributions approach&rdquo; to determine eligibility for a State pension. The level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life. The proposed date for the introduction of a move to a total contributions approach is 2020, but this may be subject to change. <\/p><p>  Finally, recent reforms to the pension system include a gradual increase in State pension age to 68 years and the abolition of the State pension (transition). In January 2014, State pension age was standardised at age 66 with the cessation of State pension transition. The State pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028. These reforms were introduced in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.<\/p><p>  In relation to the issue of retirement age, I would like to clarify that there is no statutory compulsory retirement age for employees in Ireland.  The setting of retirement age is a matter for agreement within the employer\/employee relationship and the contract of employment.

Despite significant levels of State spending on the OFP scheme, the results have been poor in terms of tackling poverty and social exclusion rates among lone parent families, who continue to experience higher rates of &lsquo;consistent poverty&rsquo; in comparison to the population generally. The passive nature of the payment with little systematic engagement being made by the State with recipients has engendered long-term social welfare dependency and associated poverty among one-parent families.<\/p><p>The reforms to the OFP scheme aim to address these issues by providing the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to escape inter-generational poverty and joblessness, The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, contains provisions to reduce, on a phased basis, the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which an OFP recipient&rsquo;s payment ceases to 7 years from 2014 for new entrants and from 2015 for existing recipients.  <\/p><p>The next phase of the OFP age reductions will take place on 3 July 2014 when it is expected approximately 5,140 customers will leave the OFP scheme on that date. The Department has contacted all affected customers and has invited them to attend information seminars or one-to-one sessions in their respective Social Welfare Local Office. The purpose of these sessions is to brief affected lone parents on the broad range of income and other supports, which the Department provides.<\/p><p>Special arrangements have been introduced to ease affected lone parents make the transition to another income support payment. For instance, affected OFP customers who are also in receipt of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) will have their FIS payment automatically adjusted to take account for approximately 60% of their loss of OFP.  However, it is expected that the majority of affected customers will apply for the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JA) payment. As 64% of the existing OFP population do not work it is expected that the majority of customers will suffer no loss in income when they make the transition from OFP to JA.  <\/p><p>However, in cases where customers are employed and have earnings in excess of &euro;60 per week, they will see a reduction in their weekly social welfare payment should they make the transition from OFP to JA. The reason for this reduction is the difference in the earnings disregards between the two payments. OFP recipients receive an earnings disregard of &euro;90 per week while the JA equivalent is &euro;60 per week. In addition, the OFP taper for amounts in excess of the disregard is 50% while JA has a higher taper of 60%.

This was, for the first time, signed on foot of a detailed specification of services and was openly and publicly advertised in a procurement competition for the delivery of these services.  It was essential that the procurement competition was fully compliant with European procurement law given the previous challenge adjudicated on by the European Court of Justice in relation to the cash payment services delivered through An Post.  The contract has been awarded for two years commencing on 2 January this year.  The contract may be reviewed annually for to four years thereafter &ndash; an accumulated period of up to six years in total up to December 2019.<\/p><p>  I am confident that the contract for the delivery of payments to welfare clients is now robust.  My next step was to ensure that the legislation backing the contract was equally robust.  The objective behind the proposed legislation currently being considered by the Houses of the Oireachtas is to achieve that new strength in law.  The legal provisions being considered do not interfere with the contract.  They do, however provide a basis for a new resilience in law to fully recognise that these services are being delivered under formal contractual arrangements, which was not the case heretofore. That contract is between me, as Minister, and an external payment service provider, An Post. The proposed amendments, as set out in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2014 reflect the services that An Post is providing to us to deliver welfare payments to properly authenticated clients.<\/p><p>  The measures contained in the Bill update the legal framework behind the new contract with An Post so as to ensure that its activity on behalf of the Department on a week-to-week basis has the backing required to ensure our fraud and control regime remains robust and resilient.  I place a very high value on protecting the integrity of expenditure from public funds.  Key to this is tackling the risk of fraud and abuse within the social welfare system.  The proposed amendments enhance the Department&rsquo;s opportunities in tackling fraud and abuse within the aspects of the system that directly relate to the payments to clients and allows An Post to work with the Department in implementing these controls.  <\/p><p>  I am keenly aware of the excellent work carried out by postmasters. I am also aware of the concerns and many debates that have been held over the past few months in relation to the future of An Post.  As Minister I need to ensure that the legislation can stand up to scrutiny and that neither I as Minister, nor An Post are exposed in any manner to any risk to the existing contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400062#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code","counter":675,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400062#WRM00750"},{"type":"question","counter":676,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[27342\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400062#WRM00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the ways in which a person with a jobseeker's claim can contact her Department if that person has secured very temporary employment; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that persons who secure temporary employment are experiencing difficulties in informing her Department in order that the jobseeker's claim may be suspended; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":677,"content":"<p>Where a person states that they have found work, it is normal practice for a jobseeker claim to be closed.

While as Minister I have responsibility for the legislative and policy frameworks, I have no role or function in determining energy market matters, including matters relating to energy supply for the north Kerry area.  The development and expansion of the natural gas network is in the first instance a commercial matter for Gaslink, which is mandated by legislation to develop and maintain a national system for the supply of natural gas that is both economical and efficient. The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is statutorily responsible for all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and\/or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.<\/p><p>  The CER&rsquo;s network connections policy provides that in order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be met as a prerequisite. The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the actual consumption of gas and the associated tariffs. This is designed to obviate against uneconomic projects which would increase costs for all gas consumers.<\/p><p>  The progression of electricity generation infrastructure projects is, in the first instance, a matter between the project developer and the relevant planning authority, having regard to the overarching policy and regulatory framework. <\/p><p>  Concerning the Shannon LNG proposal, since 2002, the regulation of the gas market has been the responsibility of the CER which is independent in the performance of its functions. I and Government colleagues have consistently been supportive of the proposal by Shannon LNG to construct a LNG terminal near Ballylongford, County Kerry. This LNG facility would bring connectivity for the first time to the global LNG market. The prospect of such a facility is therefore a potentially positive step for the island of Ireland. While neither I nor my Department have any direct role in regard to the project, my officials and I have met with representatives of Shannon LNG to discuss project and EU related issues.  The timing of an investment decision by Shannon LNG is a commercial decision for the company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400062#WRM03600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Generation","counter":713,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400062#WRM03650"},{"type":"question","counter":714,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[26791\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400062#WRM03700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the proportion contributed by wind energy towards overall energy and electricity bills for the country on an annual basis since 2000; the total savings to the Exchequer in terms of savings on imports and fines Ireland would have otherwise had to pay in terms of carbon emissions over the same period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":715,"content":"<p>The primary support mechanisms for renewables, including wind farms, are the Alternative Energy Requirement schemes and the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) schemes. These schemes were introduced to incentivise the development of renewable electricity generation capacity necessary to allow Ireland to meet its target of meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable generation by 2020. This target must be achieved in order for Ireland to meet its binding obligation of 16% of total energy demand to be met from renewable sources by 2020.<\/p><p>The Alternative Energy Requirement (AER) was a series of 6 competitive tender schemes to support new renewable generation that were run to the mid 2000s. REFIT is based around 15 year Power Purchase Agreements between generators and suppliers which provide developers with the necessary certainty required to finance their projects. Both AER and REFIT are funded from the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy.  The PSO levy is charged to all electricity customers. It is designed to support the national policy objectives of security of energy supply, including through the use of indigenous fuels (i.e. peat), and the use of renewable energy sources in electricity generation. The proceeds of the levy are used to recoup the additional costs incurred by suppliers in sourcing a proportion of their electricity supplies from such generators. <\/p><p>The estimates for how much subsidy is funded by way of the PSO levy for each year since 2003 are published in the annual PSO decision by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). While the bulk of subsidies for renewable electricity generation paid under these schemes have been for wind, the CER has initiated a project to generate a report on the annual and cumulative costs to date in relation to AER and REFIT support schemes for each technology supported.

This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and<\/p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. <\/p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. <\/p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention. I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This list is available on my Department's website, . Currently, a total of 18 areas in County Kildare and 40 areas in County Meath have been identified as requiring an intervention. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. I expect that this mapping exercise will be concluded in the autumn. <\/p><p>I would point out that the EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard, I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 39 fibre-based broadband networks in County Kildare, including the areas of Newbridge, Maynooth and Maynooth Business Campus, and 36 fibre-based broadband networks in County Meath, including the areas of Carnaross and Moynalty, by July 2016.<\/p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end strategy for the State led intervention. It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed strategy. EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised. This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400063#WRN00800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Offshore Exploration","counter":726,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400063#WRN00850"},{"type":"question","counter":727,"qnumday":336,"qnumall":"[26953\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400063#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the reason the State is liable for the derelict Bantry offshore jetty; the reason there is no limit on time or amount to this liability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":728,"content":"<p>A company called Gulf Oil Corporation originally built the oil terminal on Whiddy Island in Bantry Bay to use for international oil transport purposes. In addition to onshore oil storage tanks, the facility had a berth (known as a jetty) capable of accommodating large oil tankers. In 1979 a major accident occurred as oil was being unloaded from a tanker called the Betelgeuse. Fifty persons in all lost their lives in this tragic incident, which included a major fire and a series of explosions. The vessel was rendered a total wreck and extensive damage was caused to the offshore Jetty and its installations.<\/p><p>  As a consequence of the accident, the Terminal was non-operational for some 19 years. Gulf Oil Corporation ceased to exist as an independent company in 1985, when it merged with Standard Oil of California, with both re-branding as Chevron in the USA. In 1986 Chevron withdrew its operations at the Terminal. At that time the State then took over the terminal on Whiddy Island, including the derelict Jetty. An &ldquo;exit payment&rdquo; of US$44 million was paid to the State by Chevron in respect of the State taking over the Jetty, in the context of any future costs associated with the removal or repair on the Jetty, in accordance with environmental standards.<\/p><p>  The State re-commissioned the terminal in 1998 following the construction of a Single Point Mooring buoy (SPM) in Bantry Bay. The original Jetty was not necessary for the commercial operation of the terminal as this could be carried out using the SPM and the small craft harbour (on the other side of the island) for smaller operations.  In 2001 the State sold the Whitegate refinery together with the Whiddy Island terminal facility to Tosco Corporation. Tosco made it clear that they would not take any responsibility or liability for any issue relating to the Jetty. The State accepted Tosco&rsquo;s position on this matter during the sales process and provided a guarantee to that effect. <\/p><p>  The guarantee entered into by the State to retain liability for the Jetty at the time of the sale to Tosco related to a liability not held by any other party and in respect of which the State had previously received compensation. If the facilities had not been sold, the State would have continued to be potentially liable in this area, without any formal limitations.  Irish National Petroleum Corporation (INPC), which is the State company which previously ran the refinery and Whiddy Island facility, retained certain rights and obligations under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) relating to the 2001 transaction. INPC has no staff and a Board oversees the company&rsquo;s outstanding liabilities. INPC recently tendered for an Engineering and Risk Assessment of the Jetty for the purpose of evaluating its current condition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400063#WRN01000","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Internet Safety","counter":729,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400063#WRN01050"},{"type":"question","counter":730,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[26958\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400063#WRN01100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide an update on the work of the Internet content governance advisory group which he established at the end of 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1183","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":731,"content":"<p>I established the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group in December 2013 to provide me with expert, independent advice in forming legislative, policy and regulatory recommendations to Government on a range of internet content governance issues for which responsibility is spread across a number of Government Departments.

Fingal County Council (pursuant to section 152 of the Planning &amp;amp; Development Act, 2000 as amended) issued a Warning Letter to the owner of the cottage on foot of the erection of the gate. In response, the previous owner sought clarification by way of a referral under section 5 of the Act to clarify if the erection of the gate was exempted development. In this regard, it is contended by the previous and current owners that the gateway was erected in compliance with the conditions and limitations associated with Class 5 of Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Planning Regulations, and that the pathway which would be closed off by this gate is not a public right of way.  As such, they contend that it is exempted development under the planning legislation.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Fingal County Council, considering all the facts and details submitted, concurred with the previous and current owners that the development in question (i.e. the erection of the gate) was exempted development.\u00a0 This determination by Fingal County Council was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la by a local group, Howth Pathways.\u00a0 An Bord Pleanala subsequently set aside the determination of the Council and decided that the erection of the gate constituted development and was not exempt.  This Section 5 determination is now the subject of High Court Proceedings.   <\/p><p>  In September 2013, the High Court made an Order putting a stay on any steps being taken or any action being initiated pending\u00a0final determination of the proceedings.  Consequently any action by Fingal County Council in respect of the statutory Warning Letter originally issued must be stayed in accordance with the terms of the High Court Order.\u00a0The proceedings were listed in the High Court Judicial Review list in November 2013 and again in January 2014 but they were deferred on each occasion.

In the case of water services, under the provisions of the Water Services Act 2007, households&rsquo; pipes internal to the boundary of a property are considered the responsibility of the householder, and thus water meters are being fitted at the stopcock at the boundary of the property. As this is located on publicly accessible land, it minimises disruption during the installation programme and also in terms of meter reading in due course as access is not required to people&rsquo;s homes.  Meters will be read automatically and the information will be provided directly to customers in their bills.  Any unusual usage patterns can be discussed with Irish Water if the householder is concerned.  Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that all the water meters in use by Irish Water comply with the Measuring Instruments Directive. In all customer communications, Irish Water asks any householders with any disability, mobility or medical concerns to contact its call centre (1890 278 278) in advance of the meter installation so any additional support or advice can be arranged. <\/p><p>In common with meters for other utility services, the meters remain the property of Irish Water and it is illegal to tamper with a meter.  However, as the meter boxes are not sealed, it will be possible for a customer to access the meter to verify readings if necessary.  Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. They may be contacted via email to <i>oireachtasmembers@water.ie<\/i>or by telephone on 1890 278 278.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400063#WRN04100","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tribunals of Inquiry Recommendations","counter":775,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400063#WRN04150"},{"type":"question","counter":776,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[26658\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400063#WRN04200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to implement the findings and recommendations of the Mahon tribunal.; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":777,"content":"<p>The Government considered the findings of the Final Report of the Mahon Tribunal at its meeting on 27 March 2012 and published its response to the Final Report recommendations on 19 July 2012.

The announcement of the review followed consideration of various sample complaints and concerns referred to the Minister by a number of stakeholder groups and individuals. While it was originally contemplated that this review might be undertaken by consultants, it was subsequently decided that the review should be prepared internally by my Department in light of increasingly constrained Exchequer resources. <\/p><p>  The Planning Review Report to review the performance of the planning functions in certain selected planning authorities was published on 12 June 2012. The Report recommended 12 actions which entail legislative change and consolidation, revised guidelines and improved management systems in planning authorities. I subsequently committed to have the Report assessed by an independent planning expert and, on 8 March 2013, I published the &ldquo;Independent Evaluation of the Planning Review Report June 2012&rdquo; prepared by Mr. Hendrik van der Kamp. The report by Mr. Hendrik van der Kamp led to some modifications to the original 12 recommended actions. Those actions requiring statutory underpinning are being considered in the context of forthcoming planning legislation. Others actions have been reflected in the initiation of the review of development management guidelines and the finalisation of local area plans guidelines for planning authorities and related best practice guidance. <\/p><p>  I will further consider the recommendations of both these reports in light of the forthcoming independent planning review being undertaken by MacCabe Durney Barnes Consultants on the performance of planning functions in six of the previously selected planning authorities (Carlow, Cork, Galway and Meath County Councils, and Cork and Dublin City Councils). This review is being undertaken in order to ensure maximum transparency and integrity for the planning system generally and is progressing in accordance with section 255 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The review is focused on procedures and practices rather than individual planning decisions.<\/p><p>  The review of the performance of the planning functions of the seventh planning authority which was part of the original 2012 planning review (Donegal County Council) is not included in the scope of this current independent planning review and accordingly the consultants involved will not be contacting the Donegal complainant. In this regard, on 14 June 2013, the High Court made an Order quashing that part of the original Planning Review Report relating to Donegal following a settlement between my Department and the party concerned who had brought judicial review proceedings in respect of that part of the Report. The matter has now been disposed of to the satisfaction of both sides.<\/p><p>  In light of these proceedings, my Department subsequently sought the advice of the Attorney General on how best to proceed in the case of Donegal. My Department is continuing to engage with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office on the matter and the course to be pursued in this case.\u00a0 It is expected that further legal advice will be provided in the near future, thus informing the next steps to be taken in relation to Donegal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400063#WRN04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts","counter":788,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400064#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":789,"qnumday":356,"qnumall":"[26665\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400064#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 478 of 30 April 2014, the basis of the appointment of MacCabe Durney Barnes consultants; and if there was an invitation to public tender for this contract.","asker":"1066","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":790,"qnumday":362,"qnumall":"[26672\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400064#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if the results of the report he has commissioned will be published.","asker":"1066","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":791,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 356 and 362 together.<\/p><p>  I appointed MacCabe Durney Barnes Consultants in February 2014 to carry out an independent planning review on the performance of planning functions in six selected planning authorities (Carlow, Cork, Galway and Meath County Councils and Cork and Dublin City Councils) in accordance with section 255 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 following an open public tendering process and subsequent tender evaluation assessment conducted by my Department on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender.

The KCS document is the outcome of a review of fire service activities and sets out a system of national processes and standards for fire service delivery in Ireland based on a risk management approach. This addresses the critical elements of fire prevention and fire protection in buildings as well as fire brigade response.<\/p><p>The retained fire service in Ireland is recognised as a particularly appropriate community service provided by the local authorities. Retained fire-fighters are required to live and work close to their fire stations so that they can meet the generally accepted five minute turn-out times. Retained fire-fighters are paid an annual retainer in respect of the availability they provide, as well being paid hourly rates for their fire service work as set out in the Table below.<\/p><p>The standards for provision of fire services contained in KCS are based on an &lsquo;area risk categorisation&rsquo; system which is being applied across the country by all fire services. This results in individual fire station areas being risk-graded across five bands from very high to very low, based on analysis of relevant local factors including three years of activity data. The fire service response in terms of numbers of fire appliances and fire crews in an area is related to this risk categorisation. The Pre-Determined Attendance (PDA) is the initial fire service turnout in response to a call for assistance from a member of the public, and indicates the number of appliances that will be mobilised automatically in response to calls for assistance to particular categories of incident.<\/p><p>For the first time in Ireland, KCS sets out standards for normal crewing levels on fire appliances which are very much in line with international practice; the first appliance mobilised to an incident should have a normal crew compliment of 5 personnel, to include a designated Incident Commander, with 4 personnel on the second or subsequent appliances mobilised from the same station. However, KCS makes clear that this is a norm and additional available crew over the initial five may travel on the first responding fire engine or on another fire vehicle as arranged locally. The crewing standards in KCS do not affect the incomes of retained fire-fighters in any way, which are based on the availability and rates of pay as set out above.<\/p><p>KCS properly seeks to continue the downward trend in the number of fires and other incidents which the fire services respond to annually. However, the setting of national standards for Pre-Determined Attendances is expected to lead to an increase in the number of fire service turn-outs for some categories of incidents. It is also clear that implementation of KCS is leading in many cases to a higher level of other activities, including training and community fire safety, for retained fire-fighters.<\/p><p>The current rates applicable to Retained Firefighters are contained in the table below:<\/p><p><b>Retained (Part-Time) Fire Service<\/b><table><tr><th>Service <\/th><th>Station Officer <\/th><th>Sub Officer, Driver Mechanic <\/th><th>Firefighter <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>0 - 5 years <\/td><td>&euro;15,438 <\/td><td>&euro;11,687 <\/td><td>&euro;8,402 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5 &ndash; 10 years <\/td><td>&euro;17,345 <\/td><td>&euro;13,130 <\/td><td>&euro;9,439 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10 years + <\/td><td>&euro;19,078 <\/td><td>&euro;14,442 <\/td><td>&euro;10,383 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><table><tr><th><b>Hourly rate of attendance -<\/b><\/th><th><b>Drill<\/b><\/th><th><b>Fire<\/b><\/th><th><b>Fire<\/b><\/th><th><b>Fire<\/b><\/th><th><b>Fire<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>Day<\/td><td>Day  <\/td><td>Night\/Weekend<\/td><td>Night\/Weekend <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>1st Hour <\/td><td>Subsequent Hours <\/td><td>1st Hour <\/td><td>Subsequent Hours <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Rate per Hour <\/td><td>&euro;19.86 <\/td><td>&euro;39.72 <\/td><td>&euro;19.86 <\/td><td>&euro;79.44 <\/td><td>&euro;39.72 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400064#WRO03125","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":832,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400064#WRO03250"},{"type":"question","counter":833,"qnumday":377,"qnumall":"[26810\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400064#WRO03300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"in view of the signs of recovery of the building industry, his views that An Bord Plean&aacute;la board has a sufficient range of in-house expertise to deal with the anticipated extra workload; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":834,"content":"<p>Appointments to the Board of An Bord Plean&aacute;la are governed by sections 105 to 107 of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2013 and articles 56 to 65 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended.

The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.  In order to protect drinking water sources from the risk of pollution, the Regulations lay down general minimum set back distances around abstraction points used for the abstraction of drinking water for human consumption.  Land spreading of organic fertilisers (e.g. manures and slurries) is not permitted within those set back areas.  The set-back distance requirements are 200 metres from an abstraction point for a water scheme supplying 100m3 or more of water per day or serving 500 or more persons, 100 metres for an abstraction point for a water scheme supplying 10m3 or more of water per day or serving 50 or more persons, and 25 metres from any borehole, spring or well used for the abstraction of water for human consumption.   <\/p><p>  These setback distances can be reduced to 30 metres (and 15 metres in the case of small abstractions) where the local authority determines that the reduced distance does not give rise to a risk to the water supply and a potential danger to human health.

In particular, the guidelines set out a range of densities appropriate to different location types, from lower densities in the range of 15-20 dwellings per hectare at the edges of smaller towns and villages for private site type developments to densities in the range of 20-40 dwellings per hectare in more centrally or edge of centre sites in smaller towns, through to densities in the range of a minimum of 50 dwellings per hectare in larger urban areas along public transport corridors.

The most recent data from the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) Rent Index and from the Daft.ie Rental Report show the extent of rising rents, particularly in Dublin and the major cities.  In Dublin, rents for houses increased by 6.7% annually, and for apartments the figure was 10.3%. <\/p><p>  The fundamental reason behind the rise in rents is a lack of supply.  In 2006, some 93,419 housing units were completed across the country, 19,470 of them in Dublin.  In 2013, a total of 8,301 homes were completed nationally with just 1,360 in Dublin.  The volume of activity in residential building and construction remains less than half of the volume seen in the year 2000.  Increasing both public and private housing supply is a critical issue and the Government's Construction Strategy, published on 14 May 2014, is a blueprint for a properly functioning and sustainable construction sector.  It provides for a strategic approach to the provision of housing based on real and measured demand and addresses the full range of relevant issues including the planning process, financing, access to mortgage finance and the construction workforce.   <\/p><p>  Resolution of the housing supply situation is the key element in restoring stability to the market but I recognise that the provision of additional units of housing takes time.  Consequently, I have asked the Private Residential Tenancies Board to carry out a focused piece of research that will explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector due to rising rents and to report back to me with policy recommendations before the end of June.

The broad outline for developing the beef industry in Ireland was set out in my Department&rsquo;s Food Harvest 2020 (FH2020) strategy. The recommendations for development of the sector included the identification of &ldquo;target markets for which access for Irish beef, beef offals and breeding stock should be secured&rdquo;.<\/p><p>  My strategy for implementing this recommendation is to constantly develop relationships in existing and in new and expanding international markets, raising the profile of Ireland and increasing international confidence in Irish production and control systems. Since taking office I have led trade missions to China, the US, Algeria and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the Middle East. Last saw year saw yet another increase in the value of our beef exports, which rose to almost &euro;2.1 billion.<\/p><p>  Ireland is more than six times self sufficient in beef and therefore the promotion of Irish beef on external markets is critically important to the sector. There is a strong demand for meat globally and my focus is aimed at enabling Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise. My Department engages on a daily basis with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassies&rsquo; personnel on market access issues. These initiatives have led to a number of notable successes in securing market access from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran.  This year to date we have agreed access terms with the Lebanon and Namibia. In 2013 the value of beef exports is estimated to have increased by 10%, driven by a 5% rise in output and a similar jump in average prices.<\/p><p>  In November 2013, the US lifted its ban on the importation of beef from the European Union. This was one of my priorities the previous year when I visited the US, where I pushed the matter strongly with the US Department of Agriculture Secretary of State, Tom Vilsack and in meetings with Senators. Last week saw a return visit from Mr. Vilsack where we again discussed the issue of Irish beef access to the US. As part of the visit we had the opportunity to visit a beef farm in Co. Kildare to impress upon him and his officials the high quality standards which apply to beef production in Ireland. We now expect an audit team from the US in early July after which they will inform us of their decision regarding re-entry to the market.<\/p><p>  In December 2013, a delegation from my Department visited China for discussions with authorities there on the lifting of the beef BSE ban which prohibits imports from any EU country. While there are a number of stages to go before Ireland secures access for beef to China, I am hopeful that these can be progressed further in 2014.<\/p><p>  The Canadian Food inspection Agency (CFIA) visited Ireland in early February 2014 to inspect the control systems in place at national and food business operator level.  A positive outcome to the visit could lead to export opportunities to this premium market in the near future. <\/p><p>  Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across EU markets. This wide portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia&rsquo;s differentiation and premiumisation strategy which focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmentally sustainable, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages and superior eating quality. Among Bord Bia&rsquo;s key initiatives this year is the continued development, global promotion and marketing of its Origin Green initiative, designed to establish Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink. Over 200 companies are currently working with Bord Bia to develop, and commit to, sustainability plans setting out clear targets in emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and corporate social responsibility activities.<\/p><p>  This year, I hosted two round-table discussions with the key stakeholders in the beef sector. An important promotional measure that I announced of foot of these discussions is the allocation by Bord Bia of an additional &euro;0.5m to intensify its marketing of Irish beef in the UK, Netherlands and Germany and I understand the bulk of this money will be spent between now and the peak autumn cattle supply period. An additional &euro;85,000 will go towards the UK market, bringing Bord Bia&rsquo;s total spend for marketing Irish beef in the UK to &euro;0.4 million.  The additional expenditure will contribute towards an online promotion on well-known food websites, as well as profiling Irish beef through recipes and competitions.<\/p><p>  A manufacturing category study is also being carried out to reaffirm the position of Irish beef alongside British beef as an ingredient in value-added ready meals. This &euro;0.5m allocation is in addition to the &euro;9m budget spend per year by Bord Bia on marketing of Irish beef internationally.Domestically, Bord Bia will spend &euro;170,000 this year in the promotion of Irish beef, to reinforce consumer purchasing of beef with the Bord Bia Quality Mark. This is achieved through initiatives such as the airing of television adverts, sponsorship of cookery programs on television such as &lsquo;Nevin Maguire&rsquo;s Home Chef&rsquo;, cookery demonstrations at events such as &lsquo;Bloom&rsquo; and also in schools, as well as publication of recipes in consumer leaflets and on Bord Bia&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>  I am sure the Deputy will agree that there are very substantial resources dedicated to the promotion of Irish beef, both home and abroad. The export performance of Irish beef has been one of the major success stories of the Irish agrifood sector in recent years and I expect that our export performance will continue to improve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400066#WRQ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agrifood Sector","counter":909,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400066#WRQ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":910,"qnumday":404,"qnumall":"[26596\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400066#WRQ01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on below-cost selling of agricultural produce; the way producers could be protected from this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":911,"content":"<p>Fairness in commercial dealings is a key ingredient of a sustainable and well functioning food supply chain.

This reputation arises as a direct result of the high level of compliance from stakeholders, coupled with effective enforcement on the part of the staff in my Department.  The Deputy will be aware that any system of enforcement must carry sanctions which are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.  In a minority of cases, this includes submission of files for prosecution before the Courts.  These controls are effected by a range of DAFM inspectorates, including the Special Investigation Unit, which constitutes a very small proportion of the overall DAFM staff involved in implementing legislation and in investigating breaches.<\/p><p>  The legal costs associated with legal proceedings initiated by my Department as a result of the investigations carried out by the Unit are, in general, borne by the CSSO and are a matter for that body.  However, since 2004, my Department has paid &euro;126,057 in respect of legal proceedings arising from investigations by the Special Investigation Unit.  Such costs have to be seen in the context of the need to preserve the reputation of Irish agriculture and food, exports of which amounted to &euro;10.7 billion in 2013.<\/p><p>  The investigative procedures adopted by the SIU comply with the standard requirements in regard to the taking and presentation of evidence and the rights of the person or persons being investigated.

If still dissatisfied with the outcome, a complainant also has the right to have his\/her complaint forwarded to the Office of the Ombudsman.

Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application. As at 8 June 2014 there were 4,353 persons availing of direct provision accommodation and supports in 34 accommodation centres in the State.<\/p><p>  The operation of the Direct Provision system is kept under review and I acknowledge that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed.  I have no desire for applicants to remain in the protection system any longer than the minimum period it takes to process their case.  The median processing time to a final decision by the Minister on an asylum application in 2013 was 36 weeks.  Some cases can take significantly longer to complete due to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and other relevant statutory provisions.  High quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.<\/p><p>  Persons who are refused refugee status are notified of their entitlement to apply for subsidiary protection.  This is separate to the asylum or refugee status determination process. This is invariably followed by the so-called leave to remain process. Each of these processes which determine whether an applicant can remain in the State are hugely complex and subject to oversight by the courts and have to be examined in accordance with a large body of Irish and international law. There are no shortcuts as the outcomes can lead to the most fundamental life-changing event for the applicants.<\/p><p>  Measures have recently been taken with a view to delivering improvements in the processing of protection applications. The Deputy may be aware that the European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 426 of 2013) were signed into law by my predecessor last November. Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection was transferred from my Department to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) with appeals to be dealt with by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT).  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals, respectively.<\/p><p>  Additional resources have been allocated to the establishment and operation of the new arrangements for the processing of these cases which include the engagement of a panel of legally qualified persons to process cases, personal interviews for each applicant at the first instance and the opportunity for an applicant to appeal a negative recommendation of the ORAC to the RAT. The ORAC, in consultation with the UNHCR, have recently published on its website details of how it will prioritise the process of scheduling persons for interview taking into account, inter-alia, dealing with applicants who are longest in the system first. The intention is to process as many of these cases to finality, to include consideration of any leave to remain aspects arising, in the shortest possible timeframe  consistent with quality and fair assessment of all cases and of course, subject to the cooperation of applicants and no further legal impediments arising.<\/p><p>  The Government remains committed to immigration and protection reform as provided for under the Programme for Government and under the Government Legislation Programme. Legislating to provide the means for a single procedure and related issues to deal with all protection claims is of priority in that it will provide the framework for removing the structural delays which are a feature of our existing protection system. In that respect work by my officials on legislative reform in this area continues, including in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of the Parliamentary Counsel, with a view to bringing forward legislation this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400068#WRS03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":1050,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400068#WRS03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1051,"qnumday":454,"qnumall":"[26703\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400068#WRS03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will enact the Coroners Bill 2007; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1052,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Coroners Bill 2007 is before the Seanad.

That human suffering is still felt to this very day and our thoughts are with the victims of the many atrocities perpetrated over the course of the troubles and their families.<\/p><p>  Mr. Justice Henry Barron carried out a detailed and painstaking independent inquiry into those awful events and, indeed, other atrocities that took place between 1972 and 1976 in which so many innocent people lost their lives.  Related matters were also investigated by a Commission of Investigation carried out by Patrick McEntee SC.  Arising from the report of the Barron Inquiry and the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights the Garda Commissioner appointed a dedicated liaison officer for the victims of the bombings in Dublin in 1972 and 1973 and in Dublin and Monaghan in 1974.  This dedicated liaison service has been in place since then.  It is currently provided by a Garda Superintendent based at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation in Dublin.<\/p><p>  It is the policy of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide effective liaison with the victims of crime and their families.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is strongly aware of the importance of victims in the criminal justice system and will continue to make efforts to ensure their needs are met, particularly in respect of making information available to them.  The Garda authorities are conscious of the need to ensure that the liaison process is operated in order to best address the needs of the individual victims while at the same time ensuring that criminal investigations would not be in any way compromised.<\/p><p>  In achieving this and in the interests of operational effectiveness, Garda liaison with the victims of serious crime and their families, such as those crimes related to the conflict in Northern Ireland, is provided directly to them from the Garda Division and investigation team which is investigating the case at hand.  The Garda&iacute; in the Division which is investigating a case are in possession of the detailed and up-to-date information with regard to it and are, therefore, best placed to interact with the victims and their families.  Such interaction is done directly by or under the supervision of the relevant Garda Superintendent.<\/p><p>  I am sure the Deputy will agree that we must always be conscious that the victims of crime are individuals with individual needs and that any approach must take into account the specific requirements of the individuals themselves.  As part of the Government's comprehensive programme of reform in the areas of policing and justice in the State, I have indicated my intention to bring forward new legislation in relation to the remit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.

Our sympathy is with this young boy and his family, and as I outlined to the House last week, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is determined to bring to justice those involved.  I have also indicated my willingness to meet members of the local community.<\/p><p>  While the challenges faced are very real, Garda&iacute; tackle organised and gun crime through a range of targeted and intelligence based operations, often disrupting and preventing incidents, as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved.  I recently discussed the challenges presented by this type of crime, and particularly its association with organised crime, with the Acting Commissioner, who outlined the substantial efforts being made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify and target those involved.<\/p><p>  Addressing organised crime is a key ongoing priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this priority is clearly reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for 2014. This priority is given effect through a range of targeted activities designed to disrupt and dismantle criminal operations. This involves the use of focused intelligence led operations by specialist units such as the Organised Crime Unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau and international cooperation including through Garda liaison officers based in other jurisdictions and in bodies such as Interpol and Europol.<\/p><p>  We all appreciate the concern that gun crime gives rise to in the community but it is only right that we also we acknowledge that the number of crime incidents in which a firearm was involved was last seen down, by more than 7%.  It is also important to note that, in addition to law enforcement and criminal investigation, the Garda&iacute; work closely with local communities to address local concerns about crime and community safety, including through schemes to divert young people from getting involved in criminality.<\/p><p>  It is clear to all that gun crime has for some time been an inherent part of organised criminal activity in this jurisdiction, as it is in other similar countries.  This demands a robust response and this is precisely what is happening.  Considerable powers and investigative tools are available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to which we have recently added the DNA database legislation.  The Garda&iacute; make extensive use of these powers to tackle and disrupt organised crime, with persons regularly brought before the courts and substantial sentences handed down.  I can assure the Deputy that confronting organised crime and the harm it causes is a priority for the Government and will certainly be a priority for me as Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400068#WRS06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1082,"content":"<p>Question No. 464 answered with Question No. 447.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Closed Circuit Television Systems","counter":1083,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400068#WRS06600"},{"type":"question","counter":1084,"qnumday":465,"qnumall":"[26813\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400068#WRS06700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"in view of the recent drugs seizure by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the village of Newtownforbes, when she will provide security cameras in the village to dispel the fears of the residents.","asker":"1062","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1085,"content":"<p>Garda CCTV systems are planned and implemented on the basis of the Garda Commissioner's identified operational needs and priorities.

This has necessitated the temporary redeployment of large numbers of Garda&iacute;, including specially trained personnel, from throughout the Western Region into the Belmullet District.  The reality is that substantial Garda resources have to be tied up in the policing of protest activity at this location.  This has been necessary in view of the actions of some of the protestors, many of whom are not from the area and engage in acts of public disorder as well as damage to property.<\/p><p>  The action of some of the protestors was designed not just to register their disapproval of the work going on there but to try to prevent that work proceeding. The aim of these policing measures is to prevent public order offences and to ensure that people can go about their lawful business.  From 2011 to 2013, 38 people were brought before the courts for public order offences, criminal damage and assault on Garda&iacute; in connection with the protests at the Corrib site.  The total cost of policing these protests has now reached in excess of &euro;16m. This does not include the significant cost of the basic salaries of the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have performed duties at the Corrib Gas Project as these arise in the normal course.  Such expenditure comes at a time of economic difficulty for the State and when such resources could be put to far better use elsewhere.<\/p><p>  I am not aware of any basis on which I should initiate a public inquiry into what of its nature is a difficult policing operation.  It is, of course, open to persons to make complaints to GSOC.  In fact, GSOC has investigated in the region of 124 complaints against members of the force arising from policing at this location and that other matters remain under investigation by it.  In excess of 100 of these complaints have either been found by GSOC to be inadmissible or not to have disclosed breaches of discipline on the part of the members complained of, and that those that did indicate a breach of discipline on the part of the Garda member concerned related to the behaviour of the individual member rather than practices, policies or procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  As I have indicated previously, a review is ongoing on the effectiveness of the provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and Regulations made under the Act insofar as they relate to the oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the powers and remit of the Ombudsman Commission.

This commitment is being delivered through the Services' joint Women&rsquo;s Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2016 which was published on 6 March, 2014.  The strategy entitled &ldquo;An Effective Response to Women Who Offend&rdquo; outlines how the two agencies along with other statutory, community, and voluntary sector partners will provide customised interventions for women with the aim to reduce offending, improve opportunities for reintegration, and to improve outcomes more generally.<\/p><p>  While the majority of women&rsquo;s offending behaviour is at the lower end of the seriousness scale, it is acknowledged that they generally have a high level of need which can make the impact of imprisonment for them and their families particularly challenging.  This strategy will deal with this through a dedicated and effective approach to working with women offenders.<\/p><p>  As regards accommodation for female prisoners, a refurbishment project in the D&oacute;chas Centre to convert a building previously used for administration and storage into prisoner accommodation was completed in 2012 providing an additional 20 prisoners spaces.

In addition, six specialist judges of the Circuit Court were appointed in July 2013 to deal with the new work arising as a result of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.

The supplier can make an application to the HSE for their product to be included on the list of products covered under the GMS and other community drug schemes. The application is considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines. <\/p><p>  In accordance with these procedures, the HSE may ask the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) to conduct a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of the new product which provides detailed information on the potential budget impact of the medicine. It also assesses whether the product is cost effective at the price quoted by the company in question. The NCPE report is an important input to assist the HSE in its decision making process and informs further discussions between the HSE and the supplier.  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.<\/p><p>There are currently two levonorgestrel emergency hormonal contraception products licensed for sale on the Irish market &ndash; Levonelle&reg; and NorLevo&reg;.  Levonelle&reg; is a prescription only product which is currently included on the List of Reimbursable Items for the GMS and other community drug schemes. This product is therefore available to medical card holders under the GMS Scheme, subject to the prescription charge, once they have a prescription from their GP.  The other levonorgestrel emergency hormonal contraception product licensed for sale on the Irish market is NorLevo&reg;. In February, 2011 the Irish Medicines Board announced its decision to allow the sale of NorLevo&reg; without prescription. This product may, therefore, be supplied from pharmacies without a prescription by or under the personal supervision of the pharmacist.  <i><\/i><\/p><p>However, as NorLevo&reg; is an over-the-counter product it no longer complies with the applicable reimbursement criteria for the GMS Scheme and other community drug schemes, as a prescription is not normally required for its supply to a patient. Therefore, for all recipients of this product, the supply process is essentially a private transaction between the patient and the pharmacy.<\/p><p>In the case of  drugs and medicines which are paid for by the HSE, prices are set in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 or the terms of the framework agreements between the Department of Health and the HSE and the representative bodies for pharmaceutical manufacturers in Ireland. However, neither the Minister for Health nor the HSE has any power to set the prices of drugs and medicines purchased by private patients.  <\/p><p>The HSE advises the public that if they are being charged prices which exceed the reimbursement price listed on the HSE website (), plus a dispensing fee of between &euro;3.50 and &euro;5, then they should discuss the differential with their pharmacist to ensure they get the best possible price for the medicine concerned.  In addition, measures have been taken to increase price transparency among retail pharmacies. In March of this year the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland issued guidelines to pharmacists on procedures and minimum standards of information to be provided to customers, including a requirement to provide an itemised receipt of purchase of medicines. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400076#WRAA04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Funding","counter":1606,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400077#WRBB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1607,"qnumday":642,"qnumall":"[27251\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400077#WRBB00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"with regard to mental health, if his Department will provide formal support and funding for the continuation and further development of USI&rsquo;s successful More Talk, More Action campaign in conjunction with several mental health organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1608,"content":"<p>Funding of specific mental health services and initiatives is a matter for the HSE in the first instance and needs to be considered in light of the resources available and the relevant service priorities.

Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per item reimbursed is now running at 2001\/2002 levels. <\/p><p>  A major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012. The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nine EU member states. The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs.<\/p><p>  A new agreement was also reached in October 2012 with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry. Under this Agreement, the maximum price the HSE paid for generic products was 50% of the initial price of an originator medicine. Recent negotiations with the APMI have resulted in additional price reductions being agreed. From 1 May 2014, the maximum price the HSE will pay for generic products will be 40% of the initial price of an originator medicine. This will result in the price differential between off-patent drugs and most generic equivalents increasing from 5% to approximately 20%.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;148 million in 2014.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 introduced a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. It is expected that referencing pricing will save approximately &euro;50 million in 2014.<\/p><p>  The HSE is responsible for the administration of the primary care schemes, therefore, I have asked the HSE to examine the specific issues raised by the Deputy and to reply to her as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400077#WRBB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1624,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400077#WRBB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1625,"qnumday":648,"qnumall":"[27275\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062400077#WRBB01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite an application for a full medical card in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1626,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

This is delivered in partnership with the young person, his or her family, foster carers, social workers, key residential social care workers and other statutory, community and voluntary agencies.  Approximately 450 children leave care annually.<\/p><p>  Aftercare is the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him\/her in making the transition to independent living.  The most important requirements for young people leaving care are for continuity of relationships; secure, suitable accommodation as well as further education, employment or training.  The core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years. This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged in.  The Child and Family Agency has advised that as at the end of March 2014, 1,539 young people are in receipt of an aftercare service.<\/p><p>  Many young people remain in their foster care placement after 18 &ndash; in the region of 45%.  The assistance they need may be a continuation of the fostering arrangements and support in accessing educational opportunities.  The Agency has advised that as at the end of March 2014, some 60% of care leavers are engaged in some form of education or training.  Young people who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in either supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education.<\/p><p>  The most vulnerable group of young people are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements.  Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that helps them achieve positive outcomes.  It is essential that these young people have an opportunity to develop a relationship with a dedicated aftercare worker who will work with them to identify their needs and ensure that services are in place to help provide them with the stability and support they need. <\/p><p>  The Agency has advised that they are in the process of establishing interagency aftercare committees at local level bringing together Local Authorities, HSE and other statutory and voluntary agencies.  These committees will develop interagency wrap around aftercare plans for young people, particularly for those with complex needs, including housing requirements.<\/p><p>  A protocol, developed by the Child and Family Agency and the County and City Managers' Association, in relation to dealing with accommodation issues of young people leaving care, is nearing completion.  The protocol has been developed in response to the Ryan Report recommendation that the &quot;HSE and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will review the approach to prioritising identified &quot;at risk&quot; young people leaving care and requiring local authority housing&quot;. When agreed and implemented, the protocol will see the relevant local authority housing representative attend aftercare planning meetings with social workers of the Agency in relation to those young people for whom social housing has been identified as the most appropriate form of accommodation support.  This, it is hoped, will facilitate a more efficient service for those leaving care in obtaining social housing suitable to their needs.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.  This is in response to concerns, including those raised in the Ryan Report, that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.<\/p><p>  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency's duty to satisfy itself as to the child's or young person's need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.  The draft provisions also clarify the range of agencies providing relevant services with which the Agency will cooperate in the development of the plan.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, at its sitting on 1 April, considered the draft aftercare provisions.  I understand that following this meeting a report is being prepared, which will be forwarded to me in due course.
