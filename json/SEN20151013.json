It is an undervalued and unsung success story in our social protection and education systems.  I commend the Government on continuing to resource this scheme and increasing its resources.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton, strongly favours breakfast clubs in schools.  It requires a bit of extra effort on the part of the school, with teachers coming in early on a voluntary basis to monitor and administer the programme, but the bottom line is that in this day and age no child in Ireland should go to school or go through the school day hungry.  That is why this scheme is extremely important.<\/p> <p>As resources become available and as the budgetary situation improves, as we will see outlined on this budget day, more resources should be put into this scheme, because it is vital.

I know it is important to the Minister of State that we have value for money and an open and transparent tendering processes.  There is quite a bit of money involved.  We must also ensure that good-quality meals are being served to the children, that they are of a high nutritional value and that it is not just tokenism.

The Department administers the school meals programme as a targeted intervention for children at risk of food poverty and educational disadvantage.  The programme provides funding towards the provision of food services for disadvantaged children through two schemes.  The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department of Social Protection.  The second is the school meals local project schemes, through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups that run their own school meal projects.  The programme provides funding towards the provision of food services to some 1,700 schools and organisations, which benefits more than 217,500 children.  In view of the benefits of the programme, and despite pressure on the social protection budget over the last number of years, the Government allocated an additional &euro;2 million for the programme in 2015, providing a total allocation of &euro;39 million.  The Government had already increased the funding for the programme by &euro;2 million in budget 2013, which was used to extend the scheme to some 100 additional DEIS and special schools, benefitting more than 9,800 additional children.<\/p> <p>The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement by children, especially those from the most disadvantaged background.  Priority is, therefore, given to schools that are part of the Department of Education and Skills' Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, initiative for disadvantaged schools.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The additional &euro;2 million funding provided in 2015 is being used to increase payments to existing DEIS schools with a particular focus on the provision of funding for breakfast clubs, an issue in which the Senator believes strongly and which can provide very positive outcomes for vulnerable children in terms of their school attendance, punctuality and energy levels.  There is clear evidence that good nutrition improves the concentration levels of students, and breakfast clubs are particularly effective in this regard.  A total of 57 schools and preschools in counties Laois, Offaly and Kildare were approved funding for the 2014-15 academic year at a total cost of &euro;1.3 million.

It is important that we convey our sympathies to his wife, Nicola, and to his immediate family.<\/p> <p>I also would like to join in extending my sympathy to the families of those who died in the tragedy at Carrickmines.  Ten people died, five adults and five children.  It brings home the need for us all to be mindful of one another in terms of where we live and work.  Last year we highlighted the number of deaths that occurred as a result of farming accidents.  Senator Moloney referred earlier to a person in Kerry who died in a fire.  These incidents highlight the need to focus on this issue and on how to make places safer.  Whether it is our homes or the other accommodation - such as apartments or Traveller accommodation - in which we live, we need to focus and take action.  It is a matter that we should discuss.  It is important that we convey our sympathies to the families.  This is a huge tragedy and a major loss for everyone involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015101300002#RR00200","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1444737600,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I also wish to join colleagues in extending my deepest sympathy to the Lynch, Connors and Gilbert families who lost ten members of their families in the appalling tragedy in Carrickmines.  It certainly brings home to us how fragile life is and how lives can be snuffed out in an instant as a result of an appalling accident.  I think of the extended Traveller family throughout the country, some of whom, in my town of Ballinasloe, lost relatives in Carrickmines at the weekend.  I also think of the two children who are fighting for their lives and hope they make a full recovery.<\/p> <p>I want to join in the expressions of praise for the emergency services and I think of the awful trauma that they face on an ongoing basis when called out to such horrific accidents.  I am glad that every support will be given to those families and that all accommodation on halting sites will be examined.  I also am pleased that counselling services are being made available to the many members of the families which have been impacted upon as a result of this appalling tragedy.<\/p> <p>I also join others in expressing sympathy and offering our prayers and support to Nicola Golden on the loss of her husband, Tony, who was shot in a senseless killing in Omeath at the weekend, and to her three children and his extended family.

I convey my sympathies to the families of the ten people who lost their lives in the horrific accident in Carrickmines.  As Senator Mullins stated, we must also praise the members of the emergency services who arrived at a horrific scene on Saturday.  I also express sympathy to the family of the gentleman who died over the weekend in Westmoreland Street.<\/p> <p>I pay tribute to Garda Anthony Golden, who lived in my home village of Blackrock, County Louth, where his funeral will take place on Thursday.  From all the reports I have read about his actions on Sunday, Garda Golden was an astonishingly brave man.  I called to the Garda station this morning before travelling to Dublin and ahead of the prayer service, which was held at 11 a.m.  It is surreal to think that it was less than three years ago that we all signed a book of condolence for the late Garda Adrian Donohoe.  At that time, we hoped and prayed that something like that would never happen again.  The whole community has been shaken to its core by the events of last weekend. <\/p> <p>The Garda is still dealing with the death of Garda Adrian Donohoe.  My thoughts go out to his wife, Caroline, and their two children, who must be feeling for the Golden family today.  I also extend my sympathy to Garda Golden's wife, Nicola, their three young children, Garda Golden's family in County Mayo, and his mother-in-law, Nicola's mother, Iris O'Sullivan, who also lives in Blackrock.

I also offer my sympathy to the extended community in Carrickmines and Bray and the Traveller friends of the families living in neighbouring districts, who are doing Trojan work providing services and facilities to the families, including counselling.  The council will also help out, and I am aware that an online fund has been established by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to help with the costs of ten funerals, which will be an expensive business.<\/p> <p>I pay tribute to Garda Tony Golden.  May he rest in peace.  I extend my sympathies to his wife and three children.  Garda Golden's death brings home to us again that garda&iacute; put their lives in danger every day of the week.

I extend my sympathies to Tony Golden's Garda colleagues in the Omeath-Carlingford branch and to garda&iacute; in the wider Dundalk area.  He was a true community garda.  I read a description of him as a gentle giant and I endorse that statement.  He was a gentle giant who went about his duties quietly and with great dignity.  I had the privilege of knowing him and had a cup of tea with him only two weeks ago in Carlingford.  He paid the ultimate price of his own life in going to help someone in his community who was suffering violence in her own home.  People ask what would have happened if he had had the assistance of three or four garda&iacute;. I believe they would have paid the same price.  It was a truly devastating evening in the parish of Omeath and Carlingford, where we were celebrating the wonderful sporting feats of our rugby team that same Sunday.
