","asker":"1020","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":7,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Taoiseach mentioned in this House shortly before the recess that he had held discussions with Chancellor Merkel on finding ways to reinforce Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery by improving funding mechanisms for the real economy, including access to finance for Irish SMEs. The German Government has asked KfW, the German development bank, to work with the German and Irish authorities swiftly, in order to deliver on this initiative at the earliest possible date. <\/p><p>  Officials at my Department with assistance from staff of the NPRF have worked quickly to investigate ways to ensure that the benefit of this cooperation to Irish SMEs can be maximised.<\/p><p>  A small party of my officials travelled to a meeting with their counterparts in Berlin in early December and a week later a similar meeting was held at KfW&rsquo;s headquarters in Frankfurt. Officials from KfW and the German Ministry have also met with the project team from Ireland in Dublin for a further exchange shortly before Christmas. Both sides have been represented at senior management level for each engagement.  In addition, there have been regular conference calls between the parties. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, KfW channel their funding for SMEs in Germany through a system of on-lending using commercial banks in Germany as the distribution mechanism. Typically the SMEs can avail of KfW funding at different terms and conditions applicable to that offered directly by the financial institutions. This model is similar to the on lending arrangements available to Irish domestic institutions using funds from the European Investment Bank. <\/p><p>  The precise arrangements for the structure, level of funding and distribution options are the subject of the discussions between the relevant officials at present and will have to adhere to EU State Aid considerations.  Experience in other countries suggests that any lending facilitated by a state sponsored investment institution like KfW is generally complementary to SME lending already taking place in an economy and can in fact assist in improving both the supply and demand for finance. <\/p><p>  The Government recognises that SMEs are the lifeblood of the Irish economy and play a crucial role in employment growth in our country.  Since March 2011 Government policy has concentrated on ensuring that viable micro, small and medium sized enterprises have access to capital, equity and debt funding from a more diverse range of sources. The potential new arrangement with KfW, which my officials are currently exploring, represents a continuation of this Government&rsquo;s concerted focus on ensuring that viable SMEs have access to finance in a manner that supports economic recovery and employment growth. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600051#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Operations","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600051#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[1633\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600051#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the impact of recent allegations regarding the alleged leaking of confidential information from the National Asset Management Agency on the organisations ability to fulfil its mandate; the way security of information can be guaranteed within NAMA; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>The Deputy, as a member of the D&aacute;il Committee of Public Accounts (PAC), will be aware that the Chairman and Chief Executive of NAMA appeared before that Committee on 20th December 2013 and robustly defended the Agency against allegations that had been circulated to certain outlets in the media and to certain members of the Oireachtas during the preceding week.   <\/p><p>  The NAMA Chief Executive stated clearly that the allegations, in so far as NAMA had knowledge of them, were unsubstantiated. The NAMA Chairman stated clearly that NAMA has no tolerance for misdemeanour or any wrongdoing and that where it is made aware of any complaint, it fully investigates it and, if appropriate, refers the matter to the Garda&iacute;.  <\/p><p>  I am advised by NAMA that it will fully and robustly continue to defend its position in relation to any allegations made against it in such proceedings, and I am further informed that NAMA has a 100% track record in defending any such cases.<\/p><p>  Members of this House will be aware that s.19 of Criminal Justice Act obliges anybody with information which might be relevant in the context of the potential commission of an offence by any person, to disclose that information to a member of An Garda Siochana, and this section makes it an offence not only to fail to disclose that information, but to fail to disclose it as soon as it is practicable to do so.<\/p><p><b>Valuations<\/b><\/p><p>  Amongst the allegations was a claim that NAMA engaged in a deliberate process of manipulating the valuation of property which was collateral for its acquired loans.  NAMA refuted this allegation and set out their position during the PAC proceedings in December. The NAMA Chief Executive indicated that NAMA did not in fact set the property valuations and that the entire valuations process was subject to extensive independent auditing, including on behalf of the European Commission and by the Comptroller and Auditor General. I note that the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr McCarthy, also advised the PAC that he could not see on a broad scale how there could have been any undervaluation of loans acquired by NAMA given the Agency&rsquo;s approach to securing independent valuations.<\/p><p><b>Safeguards to protect the confidentiality of information<\/b><\/p><p>  There are extensive safeguards in place to protect the confidentiality of information held by NTMA employees, including those assigned to NAMA. Employees assigned to NAMA by the NTMA, as is the case with all NTMA staff, are subject to Section 14 of the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990 which prohibits an employee from disclosing any information obtained while carrying out their duties as employees of the NTMA. Employees assigned to NAMA are also subject to a prohibition on release of confidential data under Sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act 2009. All NTMA employees, including those assigned to NAMA, are subject to the Official Secrets Act.  Contravention of these prohibitions is a criminal offence.  On conviction there is a fine not exceeding &euro;5m and\/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. These protections do not cease at the point of resignation but rather apply indefinitely and extend to former employees.  <\/p><p>  The NAMA Chairman outlined to the PAC in December that NAMA has enhanced IT arrangements in place that limit access to information: access for staff is now confined and limited only to the information that the individual needs to do his or her work on a day-to-day basis.  The NAMA Chairman also pointed out that there is an extensive audit trail right across NAMA IT systems in respect of e-mails and documentation making it possible for NAMA to track access and printing of documents. The NAMA Chairman added that while the NAMA systems are now well advanced, the Board remains focused on continual improvement.<\/p><p><b>Progress<\/b><\/p><p>  I would like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the NAMA&rsquo;s 2013 End-of-year Review, which was published on the 3rd of January and which details the continued significant progress that the Agency is making by reference to the objectives set for it by the Oireachtas; it is also available on NAMA&rsquo;s website www.nama.ie.  This includes the generation of &euro;16.5bn in cash inflows from inception to end-December 2013, some &euro;5.8bn of which was generated in 2013, and the repayment of &euro;7.5bn or one quarter of its senior debt by end-2013. The achievement of its first major debt repayment milestone is very significant, not only for NAMA in terms of its own progress, but also because it was a key Troika target and it reinforces, at a critical time in our recovery, the very positive international perception that Ireland as a country is resolute in addressing its difficulties and meeting its targets. I also point out that NAMA has generated sufficient cash reserves to cover its costs, including debt interest and loan servicing fees.  It is important to note that NAMA is self-funding and does not draw on the Exchequer and therefore is not a burden for the Government in the context of its annual budgetary arithmetic. NAMA is also in a position, as a result of its strong performance, to invest in various commercial and residential projects which, when completed, are expected to yield returns to assist the economy.<\/p><p><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/p><p>  When addressing the PAC, the NAMA Chairman made clear the NAMA Board&rsquo;s determination that the Agency will not be deflected from achieving its objectives by the circulation of allegations designed to serve not the interest of Irish taxpayers but rather the narrow interests of individuals who are in dispute with the Agency.  Members of the House should, I believe, consider carefully what both the NAMA Chairman and Chief Executive have had to say on this matter.  NAMA has been the subject of efforts to spread damaging and unfounded stories about it in the past.  At no stage since its inception has NAMA been deflected by these efforts from doing its work on behalf of Irish taxpayers and I fully accept the NAMA Board&rsquo;s commitment that it will not allow itself to be so deflected now or at any time in the future.  I would regard it as a more serious matter if NAMA was not being criticised but rather was being universally praised by debtors and others as this would tell an altogether different story of how NAMA is working to recover monies for the State.  By necessity NAMA has to have a hard edge in the work it does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600051#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Resolution Processes","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600051#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[1634\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600051#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is still pursuing an arrangement to deal with loss making tracker mortgages in Irish banks; when he expects progress to be make in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>As the deputy will be aware Tracker mortgages were a particular feature of the Irish mortgage market in the recent past with many tracker mortgages originated during the property market boom in 2004 to 2008.   Tracker mortgages were lent for both primary dwellings and buy-to-let investments and represent 60 per cent of the aggregate mortgage lending of AIB, BoI, and PTSB. These are low interest earning assets with a variable rate set at a fixed margin above the ECB policy rate &ndash;the majority of which result in a negative carry for the originating banks, that is, the rate that tracker mortgage borrowers pay on their mortgage is lower than the rate the banks fund themselves.<\/p><p>  Although, these assets continue to be loss-making and represent a drag on the Banks profitability the situation is improving and is not preventing the banks returning to viability.<\/p><p><b><i>Improvements in Bank funding<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  In the past year improved confidence in the Irish Sovereign and its Banks together with the normalisation of money market interest rates in the Euro area has helped to further stabilise the domestic banking sector. This has allowed the profile of Bank funding to revert to a more normal sustainable mix. Funding rates in the wholesale markets are also starting to converge towards the banks more higher- rated European peers.<\/p><p>As recent capital market transactions have demonstrated the Irish banks have been able to access both secured and unsecured funding at competitive rates in a range of maturities across the curve. In addition, the deposit base has stabilised resulting in reduced reliance on central bank funding. Taken together this has helped to reduce the impact of the negative carry associated with tracker mortgages  .<\/p><p>  Furthermore, over the medium to long term an eventual increase in ECB policy rates will further reduce this negative carry, insofar as the differential between the rate that the banks fund themselves on the markets and the rate that tracker mortgage borrowers pay on their mortgage will narrow or ultimately yield a positive margin.  <\/p><p><b><i>Banks becoming profitable again<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  Recent  interim results and disclosures by the Banks indicate that the banks have made a lot of progress on re-pricing deposits and certain loan portfolios. In addition, operating costs and government guarantee fees are falling, boosting pre-provision profits. Both AIB and BOI have signalled a return to profitability in 2014 and over time it is expected that both banks will trade their way into sustainable profitability. This will place them in a better position to absorb the impact of the Trackers mortgages.<\/p><p><b><i>Self help measures<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  In recent times the Banks have pursued self-help measures to address this issue by introducing innovative solutions such as offering negative equity type mortgages and allowing borrowers to retain tracker facilities when moving house for a fixed period. These initiatives together with the recovery in the property market and an associated rise in housing transactions will also help to alleviate the issue. <\/p><p><b><i>Conclusion<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>In conclusion as I have previously advised the house, during recent Review Missions of the Troika the Irish authorities discussed the issues associated with tracker mortgages though these interactions did not yield any viable solution to the problem .While the trackers are less of a concern for the banks than in the recent past,   we naturally remain interested in examining any sensible ideas that could help lower the funding cost associated with these assets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600051#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Application","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600051#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[1553\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600051#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will confirm regarding the rent a room tax relief scheme if the income up to &euro;10,000 threshold per annum is exempt from PRSI in addition to the exemption from standard income tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>Section 216A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for the rent-a-room scheme.

The Consumer Protection Code obliges the regulated entities to ensure that their own activities and any outsourced activity, such as debt collection, complies with the requirements of the Code. This means that activity should uphold principles in the Code such as the requirement for institutions:<\/p><p>  -  not to exert undue pressure or undue influence on a customer;<\/p><p>  -  to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of customers and to act with due skill, care and diligence in the best interest of its customers; and<\/p><p>  -  to prohibit personal visits or oral communications except in specified circumstances.   <\/p><p>  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears sets out requirements for mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears.  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers. <\/p><p>  The matter of sales of loans or transfers of loans is a very complex legal area, particular to the terms and conditions of individual consumer agreements and the specific &lsquo;transfer&rsquo; involved.  For example, some transfer documentation includes a clause which stipulates that the lender (not the transferee) remains responsible for administration including setting interest rates and arrears handling.<\/p><p>  The position may be further complicated where the transferee (the new holder of the loan book) engages in a restructuring which changes the terms of the credit to the consumer. <\/p><p>  Where Central Bank regulated financial institutions sell part, or all, of their mortgage loan book to another regulated financial institution, the same protections apply to borrowers, including the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Consumer Protection Code. Any agent acting on behalf of a regulated lender must comply with the requirements of Irish financial services law. Failure to do so may result in the Central Bank imposing penalties on the regulated lender concerned.   <\/p><p>  By virtue of an exemption in Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997(as amended), an unregulated entity to which a cash loan is transferred by a regulated entity is not subject to Central Bank supervision under the Consumer Protection Code and CCMA.<\/p><p>  However, statute law provides for certain protections where the property is a principal private residence.  For example, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 provides the power to a Court to adjourn repossession proceedings in respect of a principal private residence for a period to see if a Personal Insolvency Arrangement could be agreed as an alternative resolution of the matter.   This statutory provision will be applicable in all repossession cases that involve a principal private residence, irrespective of the particular categorisation\/status of the mortgagor.<\/p><p>  I should also point out that to all debt collectors that operate across any or all sectors of the economy, including private individuals and debt collecting firms are subject to the provisions of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 .  Under section 11 of this Act, it is an offence to demand payment of a debt in a way that is designed to cause alarm, distress or humiliation.

Projections thereafter are based on an estimate of Ireland&rsquo;s potential output, factoring in assumptions regarding population growth, participation rates and labour productivity growth. Projections over 2017 to 2020 benefitted from input from PMCA consultants and constitute a reasonable trajectory for real growth, labour productivity and employment. The baseline scenario represents my Department&rsquo;s current best estimate of the future path of the macroeconomic variables set out in the MTES. GDP growth over 2013 to 2020 is projected to average 2.6 per cent per annum, compared with an equivalent figure of 3.6 per cent in ESRI&rsquo;s July 2013 <i>Medium Term Review<\/i>  .<\/p><p>  It is important to emphasise that the high-growth scenario which the Deputy refers to is not a forecast for the economy. Rather, my Department, working with the ESRI&rsquo;s HERMES model, sought to quantify the economic impact of a suite of potential policy measures. The range of conditions modelled included greater dividend from existing labour market activation policies, re-orienting the tax system away from labour-related taxes, a lower cost of credit, and improvements in the stock of human capital. In broad terms, the aggregated effect of these was added to my Department&rsquo;s baseline projections to show what the impact of implementing policies to support such conditions would be on the economy. Their combined impact on output, employment and the public finances constitutes the &lsquo;high-growth scenario&rsquo;. Again, I stress that it does not represent a forecast for what will happen to the economy; rather the objective was to demonstrate the impact which reforms would have on the economy.<\/p><p>  As part of its enhanced risk function, my Department constantly evaluates emerging economic risks, both positive and negative, and assesses their potential impact upon the economy. In undertaking this modelling exercise, a number of different potential policy measures were considered. Not all of these measures were modelled and not all of the measures that were modelled were included in the final suite of policy measures included in the MTES high-growth scenario. As the HERMES model results are broadly symmetric, the results of a number of the policy measures modelled can be considered as having either a positive or negative impact upon output. For instance, the results of an improvement in competition policy which lowers inflation and boosts growth can also be interpreted negatively as the results of a deterioration in competition which raises inflation and lowers growth.<\/p><p>  Packages of policy measures which negatively impact upon the economy were also considered. The purpose of modelling these policies was to quantify downside risk and estimate the potential cost of policy errors. However, as the Government does not intend to knowingly undertake erroneous policy choices, the results of these scenarios were not included in the MTES.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600051#WRA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Correspondence","counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600051#WRA01950"},{"type":"question","counter":29,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[1649\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600051#WRA02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will release the letter of 19 November 2010 from Jean-Claude Trichet in view of the investigation by the EU Parliament into the role of the troika in Ireland and other countries.

MiFID II also contains important provisions relating to position management, position limits and product intervention. These provisions are in respect of all financial instruments, including commodity derivatives, and have the purpose of providing regulators with tools to avoid excessive speculation in financial instruments, including commodity derivatives. The Council is proposing that competent authorities, with the guiding hand of ESMA, will be obligated to establish and apply position limits on the size of a position in a commodity derivative which a person can have over a specified period of time. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, subject to the final agreement between the co-legislators, competent authorities will have product intervention powers whereby they may prohibit or restrict trading of financial instruments or prohibit or restrict investment activities when there is a threat to the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or commodity markets. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will have contingency and coordination powers in position management and product intervention to ensure consistent application across all Member States. In the exercise of its powers, ESMA will also have to consult public bodies competent for the oversight, administration and regulation of physical agricultural markets. <\/p><p>  MiFID II contains important provisions which set out new rules for commodity derivative markets.   However, the regulation of commodity derivative markets, including where they take place Over the Counter (OTC) and as they are related to the physical commodity markets, must be assessed based on how they are dealt with across the totality of financial services files.    <\/p><p>  The MiFID II proposals complement the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), which seeks to make the derivative markets, including commodity derivative markets, safer and more transparent. This is achieved by obligating entities to report all derivative transactions, to put in place risk mitigation techniques and to centrally clear contracts with counterparties, where the entity holds a large position. In addition, regulators will now have full information on this market which has not previously been available. The provisions contained in the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) will be activated upon the entry into force of the relevant technical standards<\/p><p>  The Market Abuse Regulation, agreed under the Irish Presidency, also extends its scope within commodity derivative markets and to spot commodity markets. It clarifies that the manipulation of benchmarks, including commodity derivative benchmarks, will be an offence.<\/p><p>  This will be complemented by two other EU legislative instruments, a criminal sanctions Directive on Market Abuse and a Regulation on Benchmarks. The Regulation on Benchmarks is set to be particularly prescriptive towards commodity benchmarks.<\/p><p>  All of these EU financial services files combined are expected to result in a tighter regime for all commodity derivative markets, including food securities, whether traded OTC or through exchanges. This new legislative environment will be much more prescriptive than the current situation and will serve to prevent market abuse and to support orderly pricing in commodity derivatives and related commodity markets.<\/p><p>  We support the stronger rules as applied to commodity derivative markets to guard against market abuse and support price stability. This will curb excessive speculation and serve to reduce price volatility in the underlying commodity markets.

Qualifying expenditure is expenditure subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.  The work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 (inclusive of VAT) which would attract a credit of &euro;595.

These figures capture wider effects on incomes over the period which are not as a direct result of budgetary measures taken during the period. A more recent analysis by the ESRI focuses on the impact of budgetary measures and shows that the largest reduction in income on this basis over the period was experienced by those in the top decile. The lowest reduction in income was experienced in the third decile from the bottom.  This is consistent with previous analysis by the ESRI, the European Commission and the IMF which showed that the richest bore the highest burden. Whilst it is regrettable that the first decile may have experienced losses of close to 12%, this is far below the SJI estimate of 18.4% and also below the ESRI estimate of the losses experienced by the highest decile of close to 16%. I also note that the ESRI estimate of losses for the top decile is higher than the SJI estimate for that decile. <\/p><p>  Maintaining fairness in the budgets while ensuring the public finances return to a sustainable level is of upmost importance and my department has a number of procedures in place to assess the distributional impact of budgets. These procedures include a distributional analysis of taxation measures, published in the budget book and performed on various income levels for the different categories of income earners. These categories include single individuals, married one-earner couples with no children and married one-earner couples with children. Where possible a separate distributional analysis estimating the impacts on disposable income by income decile using SWITCH, the ESRI Tax-Benefit model, is also undertaken in evaluating various taxation options. Illustrative examples are included in the budgetary documentation.<\/p><p>  In addition to these measures I would advise the Deputy that my Department received over 700 pre-budget submissions this year from a variety of sources, both from individuals and organisations. It is a standard part of the budgetary process that each submission is examined and taken into account during the formulation of budget measures.

The Probability Risk and Impact System - PRISM, is the Central Bank&rsquo;s risk-based framework which allows for the identification of risks by their impact on financial stability and the consumer and by the probability of the risk occurring. <\/p><p>  The Government established the Commission on Credit Unions in May 2011 to make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for credit unions, taking into account their not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect members&rsquo; savings and financial stability. The Commission published its final Report in March 2012 and over sixty of its recommendations have been implemented in the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012.

Revenue collects some &euro;1.1 billion annually in excise duty from road diesel and, while there is no reliable estimate of the scale of the problem, they recognise that the potential for loss of tax revenue from fuel laundering represents a significant threat to the Exchequer and to the legitimate trade.<\/p><p>  Fuel laundering, to remove the marker added to lower-taxed mineral oil for off-road use, has been a problem for many years.  However, it remained a marginal activity because the sulphur content of marked fuel was higher than that for road fuel and therefore the sulphur content continued to distinguish laundered fuel from genuine road fuel.  Environmental requirements in relation to the sulphur content of fuel changed from the beginning of 2011, which resulted in marked fuel with the same sulphur content as road fuel coming onto the market.  With the change, fuel laundering became more viable and criminal gangs intensified their laundering and distribution activities dramatically from the first half of 2011.<\/p><p>  In response to the intensification of fraud in this area, Revenue has made action against fuel laundering one of its priorities and is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem through enhanced supply chain controls, the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker and continued robust enforcement action.#<\/p><p>  Revenue&rsquo;s strategy included strengthening the licensing conditions for auto-fuel traders in 2011 and the introduction of a new licensing system for marked fuel traders in October 2012.  In addition, since January 2013, all licensed fuel traders are required to make electronic returns to Revenue of their monthly fuel transactions.  These supply chain control measures are designed to make it difficult for fuel criminals to source marked fuel for laundering and to get laundered product onto the market.  Analysis of the monthly returns enables Revenue to identify suspicious or anomalous fuel transactions and patterns of distribution.   Traders found to be involved in suspicious activity are investigated and if they are unable to account properly for the source or disposal of product face revocation of their licence, tax assessment and prosecution, where appropriate.<\/p><p>  In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs in the UK are collaborating on identifying a more effective marker for use in both jurisdictions and signed a Memorandum of Understanding in May 2012.  A number of proposals for a new marker were received in response to an Invitation to Make Submissions and were evaluated by a joint evaluation group.  The evaluation group has completed the final evaluation and presented its recommendations to the joint project board.  The final decision on the implementation of any new marker rests with the Economic Secretary to the Treasury in the UK and the Board of the Revenue Commissioners in Ireland; the Revenue Authorities expect to make an announcement shortly.<\/p><p>  Revenue, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, continues to intensify enforcement action against fuel fraud and this work has yielded significant results to date.  In the period from 2011 to end December 2013 119 filling stations throughout the State were closed for breaches of licensing conditions.  Since the beginning of 2011, over 2.7 million litres of fuel have been seized and 29 oil laundries detected and closed down, including 9 oil laundries in 2013.<\/p><p>  Revenue regularly reminds motorists and the public generally that, in addition to its impact on the exchequer and legitimate trade, they should be aware of the risks that the use of laundered fuel poses to their vehicles and that sourcing fuel in this way is funding criminal activity.<\/p><p>  The legitimate trade can also contribute to closing down this illicit trade by providing information on the outlets that are selling laundered diesel.  Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group (HEMG) and has established regional sub-groups of the HEMG to facilitate the reporting of information by traders through their representative associations.  Retailers who suspect or have evidence that laundered diesel is being sold in their area should report this through their representative associations to Revenue.

The cost estimate relates to a potential fall in tax revenue related to foreign investors in Irish REITs, to the extent that REITs displace direct ownership of investment property.  Direct owners of investment property are taxable under Irish income or corporate tax rules.  In contrast foreign REIT shareholders will be liable to a flat Dividend Withholding Tax of 20%, with potential to reduce this to a lower rate if they qualify for relief under a tax treaty.<\/p><p>  Where an Irish-resident investor invests in property through a REIT rather than directly, the rate of taxation is the same, so no cost is associated with Irish investors.<\/p><p>  This potential cost to the Exchequer was felt to be outweighed by the benefits which REITs could bring to the market, including the following:<\/p><p>  1. Attraction of new investment capital to the Irish property market.<\/p><p>  2. Freeing up bank finance from the property market, allowing it to be re-directed to other businesses in need of bank financing.<\/p><p>  3. A new, lower-risk, property investment option for small and large investors alike.<\/p><p>  4.

The latest OECD data indicates that Ireland already has the most progressive tax system of the 21 EU countries which are members of that organisation.  It is in this context that the Government has committed in the Programme for Government not to increase the marginal rate of income tax.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners estimate that in 2014 the top 5 per cent of income earners will pay 44 per cent of the total income tax collected and those earning &euro;50,000 or less, which represents 77 per cent of income earners, will only pay 19 per cent of the total income tax collected. In addition, 856,000 individuals, representing approximately 39 per cent of the income tax base, will be exempt from income tax altogether.  <\/p><p>  Since 2008 marginal rates of taxation on income have increased from 43.5% for PAYE workers and 46.5% for the self-employed, to 52 per cent and 55 per cent, respectively. Moreover, single employees incur this relatively high marginal rate where their income exceeds &euro;32,800 per year. From an international perspective, Ireland is already considered to have a high marginal rate of tax on income. According to the latest data, Ireland has the 9th highest marginal tax rate out of the 34 members of the OECD.<\/p><p>Marginal tax rates are important because they influence individual decisions to work, or indeed to work more. A further increase in the marginal rate would reduce the incentive for income earners to work extra hours or for the self-employed to expand their business and take on more employees. Higher marginal rates of taxation undermine the competitiveness of businesses operating in Ireland, and act as a disincentive to future foreign direct investment. The OECD in its working paper &lsquo;Tax and Economic Growth&rsquo;  points to the <i>&ldquo;possibility that high top marginal rates will increase the average tax rates paid by high-skilled and high-income earners so much that they will migrate to countries with lower rates resulting in a brain drain which may lower innovative activity and productivity&rdquo;<\/i>  . <\/p><p>  For all of the above reasons, I have decided not to introduce a third band of taxation for high earners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600051#WRA04900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Corporation Tax Regime","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600051#WRA04950"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[1508\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600051#WRA05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has undertaken a cost benefit analysis of the effect of increasing Ireland's corporation tax rate; and if not, the reason this sector has been excluded from tax increases.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated in terms of expected 2014 profits, of increasing the standard rate of corporation tax from 12.5% to 13.5% is tentatively estimated on a straight line arithmetic basis to be about &euro;326 million.<\/p><p>  However, while such an estimate would be technically correct it does not take into account any possible behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence. In terms of an increase in the 12.5% rate, estimating the size of the behavioural effects is difficult but they are likely to be relatively significant. <\/p><p>  To give the Deputy an idea of what the effects of such a change would likely be, an OECD multi-country study found that a 1% increase in the corporate tax rate reduces inward investment by 3.7% on average. On this basis, it would take only a 2.5% increase in the rate (to 15%) to decrease Ireland&rsquo;s inward investment by nearly 10%. This OECD study assumes the average applies across the board but in fact the effect is likely to be more extreme for Ireland, given the economic challenges faced by a small island such as ourselves. <\/p><p>  The very major importance of maintaining the standard 12.5% rate of corporation tax to Ireland&rsquo;s international competitive position in the current climate must also be borne in mind. Ireland, like other smaller member states, is geographically and historically a peripheral country in Europe. A low corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to larger core countries. Ireland&rsquo;s low corporation tax rate plays an important role in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland and thereby increasing employment here. Recent research by the OECD also points to the importance of low corporate tax rates to encourage growth. <\/p><p>  Cost benefit analyses aside, it also would be difficult to justify such a move in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s stated position that we will not change our corporation tax strategy.

Within its existing statutory investment policy and in line with the ISIF announcement, the NPRF has undertaken a number of investments and initiatives under which NPRF capital will be invested on a commercial basis in Ireland. The funding structure for two current PPP projects involved the participation of the NPRF alongside EIB and Bank of Ireland. In addition, the NPRF continues to source investment opportunities, in preparation for the creation of the ISIF, a number of which are expected to involve construction activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600052#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":89,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600052#WRB00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":88,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600052#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[1852\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600052#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will detail, in tabular form, the total photography costs for his Department since coming to office inclusive of costs incurred from use of the ministerial allowance; the list of occasions for which photographers were booked; the photographers used; the breakdown of costs associated with each occasion that a photographer was used; if there is a policy regarding the booking of photographers within his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":90,"content":"<p>My Department only avails of the services of external photographic agencies where it is warranted, in particular, for major events and State occasions.

I am conscious of the difficulties experienced by Irish citizens who are undocumented in the United States, and I have met and spoken with many of them on my working visits there, and also with the various groups who lobby on their behalf.<\/p><p>  I have maintained contact, both directly and through our Embassy in Washington, with many key players in Congress who are influential in steering the process of US immigration reform.  Over the last four months, both the Embassy and I have had direct contact with some 70 Members of the House of Representatives and their staff.   These have included Republican Congressman Paul Ryan, Chair of the House Budgetary Committee and former Vice-Presidential nominee; Republican Congressman Bob Goodlatte, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee and several other leading Republican members of that Committee, including Immigration Sub-Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy; Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi;  Chair of the Congressional Friends of Ireland, Pete King; with House Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and their staffs.   I have also maintained contact with key figures in the US Administration and with Irish-American community representatives. <\/p><p>  I have reiterated throughout all these contacts the Government&rsquo;s interest in all aspects of immigration reform and in particular our interest in seeing an overall agreement reached which provides relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and a facility for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US.  <\/p><p>  In this context, we very much welcomed the US Senate&rsquo;s approval of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill by a 68-32 margin on 27 June last year.    <\/p><p>  The comprehensive draft legislation, which was prepared over several months by a bipartisan group of eight US Senators, provides for extensive reform of the US immigration system. It includes provisions that would legalise the status of undocumented Irish people and provide a path to permanent residency.  It also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US via the proposed E-3 visa. <\/p><p>  The focus has since shifted to the House of Representatives for its consideration of the issues and a key factor here remains convincing the Republican House Majority of the importance of making progress.     It remains to be seen whether a consolidated Bill can be agreed between the Senate and the House of Representatives.   It is generally accepted that securing overall agreement will be a complex and challenging process, also in light of other issues on the Congressional agenda which may be unrelated but can impact negatively on efforts to secure the necessary bipartisan agreement.    The next window of opportunity for any movement on immigration reform is expected to arise during the first months of this year but the exact shape and form of such movement remains to be seen.   The most recent development has been the announcement last week by Speaker Boehner that he is preparing to release a set of &ldquo;principles&rdquo; and &ldquo;standards&rdquo; to guide the House Republican side&rsquo;s consideration of immigration reform.    These are expected to become available in the coming weeks.      <\/p><p>  I am determined to continue to deploy all necessary resources at political, diplomatic and Irish community level to make progress on this vital issue.   In support of this ongoing effort, a delegation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade visited Washington DC in October last for a programme arranged by our Embassy during which they met with key members of Congress and with Irish-American community representatives.    More recently, I wrote to US House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner on 12 December last, reiterating our position and underlining our continuing strong interest in the prospect of reform of the US immigration system. I expressed the hope that the House will engage further in these issues in early 2014 leading to a positive legislative outcome.    The Government will continue to raise this issue with high-level political contacts in the period ahead, particularly during the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day period in Washington DC. <\/p><p>  In addition, the Embassy in Washington continues our intensive follow-up work with all of our contacts on Capitol Hill and particularly with the Republican House leadership.   It also continues to coordinate our lobbying efforts with our Irish-American community representatives.   I wish to acknowledge the critically important role being played by these community organisations, including the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform and the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600052#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600052#WRB01950"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[2102\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600052#WRB02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide details of each allocation from his Department&rsquo;s expenditure budget to registered charities in each of the past three years.","asker":"1091","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":111,"content":"<p>My Department is responsible for two Votes &ndash; Vote 28: Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Vote 27: International Cooperation. <font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>  The Government&rsquo;s international aid programme, Irish Aid, which is managed by my Department, is recognised internationally for its effectiveness in improving the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable communities. <\/p><p>  About a quarter of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development assistance is channelled through development Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs).

Statistical analysis of funding to NGOs in 2013 is currently being compiled and will be published in the middle of 2014.  This will be on the lines of the details provided in the Annual Report for 2012, which included a breakdown of funding to NGOs and civil society organisations, across all funding schemes operated by Irish Aid, above a grant threshold of &euro;50,000.  For 2011, the Annual Report provided information on funding to NGOs through the main civil society funding schemes operated by Irish Aid at headquarters level.   The Annual Reports are available on the Irish Aid website, at   .<\/p><p>  My Department provides funding for the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange (the Fulbright Commission), which is a registered charity, on an annual basis. The Commission was established by the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1991 to facilitate the administration of educational and cultural exchanges between Ireland and the United States of America. The Act provides that the Commission be for charitable purposes only within the meaning of section 333 of the Income Tax Act, 1967. The members of the Commission are nominated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and by the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland. Funding provided to the Commission in each of the past three years was as follows: 2011: &euro;254,000, 2012: &euro;254,000 and 2013: &euro;254,000<\/p><p>In addition, my Department&rsquo;s <b>Emigrant Support Programme<\/b>   (ESP) provides funding to non-profit organisations and projects to support Irish communities overseas and to facilitate the development of more strategic links between Ireland and the global Irish. Applicant organizations to the ESP should be established as registered charities, charitable bodies or voluntary\/not for profit organizations.  <\/p><p>While the vast majority of funding under the Emigrant Support Programme (ESP) is provided to organisations overseas, almost 12% of the budget is allocated to Irish based organisations. Recipient organisations here are typically active in providing services to returning or departing Irish emigrants or in promoting Irish heritage and sport abroad. Organisations receiving grants under the ESP are required to submit a financial report for each programme funded and financial accounts or audited financial statement. Full details of all funding provided by the Emigrant Support Programme can be found here: <\/p><p>  In addition, my Department manages a small budget aimed at supporting projects linked to DFAT&rsquo;s commitment to international peace, security and human rights. This funding is designed to complement and support Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in relation to the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). The discretionary funding available to support such activities is approximately &euro;300,000 per annum, the bulk of which is made up of payments to the UN and other international organisations. However, funding is also provided to support a number of projects managed by international civil society organisations, in areas such as human rights, conflict resolution and disarmament, and non-proliferation activities.

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that DIRT on interest bearing deposits is returned on a four-times yearly basis by financial institutions: in April, July and October of the tax year in question and in the following January.  Returns for each year are due by 15 January of the following year and the total value of DIRT due and paid is reported to Revenue on the January returns at institutional level.  Sufficiently detailed figures are not captured in these returns to enable distributional information to be compiled by reference to deposit amounts, interest amounts or DIRT amounts.<\/p><p>  Separately, under regulations, as provided for in Section 891B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, certain financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, are required to make automatic annual returns at account level electronically to Revenue.  The primary purpose of this Section is to provide information for use in risk analysis by Revenue and therefore the requirement to report interest focuses on account holders in receipt of larger payments.  The information under section 891B is provided where the total payment of interest is greater than &euro;635 in a year, regardless of deduction of DIRT, and in all instances of a first interest payment irrespective of threshold for accounts opened on or after 1 January 2008.  These returns include DIRT exempt accounts.  Returns for 2010, 2011 and 2012 were due by the end of March 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively.<\/p><p>  The total number of interest bearing deposit accounts reported under the regulations for 2010, 2011 and 2012 is 1,494,663, 1,428, 648 and 1,100, 991 respectively.  The total value of interest paid to these accounts for 2010, 2011 and 2012 is &euro;2.67 billion, &euro;2.37 billion and &euro;2.01 billion respectively.  Financial institutions reported 202,807, 188,915 and 170,085 such accounts as being exempt from DIRT for 2010, 2011 and 2012 respectively but data on the amount of DIRT forgone in respect of such accounts is not available.<\/p><p>I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the information provided under the<b><\/b>  Section 891B regulations does not include information on the amounts of deposits or linking deposits with DIRT amounts. It is also important to note the information received under Section 891B is not limited to individuals but also includes interest payments on accounts held by corporations and other entities. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may, however, be interested in a breakdown of the number of accounts for 2010, 2011 and 2012 by reference to ranges of interest amounts. A table with this information is as follows. It should be noted that financial institutions report each party to an account where the account is a Joint Account.

It is the Government&rsquo;s vision that all viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy. <\/p><p>  The Government has imposed SME lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets. <\/p><p>  AIB and Bank of Ireland are expected to lend to viable businesses both for investment and working capital purposes. The Credit Review Office is available to assist businesses which have been refused credit. The recent CRO report shows that the Credit Review Office upheld the credit appeal in 150 cases or 55% of cases decided. The upheld appeals have resulted in &euro;18.5m in credit being made available to SMEs and farms, protecting 1,521 jobs. In the recent Budget I increased the CRO appeals threshold from &euro;500,000 to &euro;3 million and I would strongly encourage SMEs refused credit to seek a review by the Office. <\/p><p>  The Government has taken a number of actions to improve the situation in relation to credit availability to SMEs. The range of credit options available to SMEs now include the Microenterprise Loan scheme which can facilitate up to &euro;40million in additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years.  In addition, the Credit Guarantee Scheme is designed for SMEs who, because of lack of collateral or because of the specialised sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing bank credit.  <\/p><p>  The SME State Bodies Group develops key policy initiatives to support SME access to credit and other forms of finance and ensures their implementation through the annual Action Plan for Jobs. It has continued in 2013 to engage intensively in proactively addressing issues associated with SME funding and financing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders through the SME Funding Consultation Committee. My officials also meet frequently with additional stakeholders who wish to contribute to policy development in relation to access to finance.<\/p><p>  It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery. However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.<\/p><p>  Competition in the mortgage market is a good thing for Irish customers. The decision by a mortgage provider on what credit products to offer is a commercial decision for the lending institution concerned.  It is important that each lending institution is allowed to assess properly and independently the risks that it is considering when making such a decision. Mortgage lending decisions must be undertaken on a sustainable and prudential basis by financial institutions and conform fully to the regulatory requirements, both in relation to the financial institution itself, and also with regard to the safeguarding of the borrower's interests.<\/p><p>  There is a consensus amongst industry commentators that there may be an emerging supply shortage in the Greater Dublin Housing market which is leading to an increase in property prices and rents across the area. A higher demand for houses in Dublin is not surprising considering the concentration of employment and the need to meet the rising demand for rental accommodation.  The Central Bank has advised me that it does not set the credit lending policies of individual banks. In a supervisory capacity, the Central Bank oversees and reviews Bank practices and regulatory adherence.  Available information on new mortgage lending activity is published by the Irish Banking Federation on a quarterly basis and this demonstrates that while recent increases in lending is evident, long term mortgage lending is at a low ebb.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600054#WRD02700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600055#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":195,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[2111\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600055#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the basis on which lending institutions currently existing or having exited from the Irish market remain accountable to the regulatory mechanisms here in terms of their winding up operations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":196,"content":"<p>Where a Central Bank regulated lender transfers all or part of its regulated activities to another regulated financial institution, the same protections apply to borrowers, including the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) and the Consumer Protection Code.

It is expected that significant savings, in terms of both reductions in staff numbers and increased efficiency and productivity, will be generated by this Reform Programme.<br \/><br \/><br \/>Savings of &euro;2 million to end December 2013 have been generated.  Savings for the remainder of the Reform Programme are yet to be quantified.  As part of the ongoing service delivery improvements within the Reform Programme the Equality Tribunal is now an intrinsic part of the Workplace Relations grouping within my Department having transferred from the Department of Justice and Equality with effect from 1st January 2013.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Discover Science and Engineering (DSE) Programme<\/td><td>In March 2012, responsibility for the DSE Programme transferred from Forf&aacute;s to Science Foundation Ireland (SFI). The programme is now named SFI Discover. <\/td><td>The transfer of DSE to SFI resulted from synergies between the DSE programme and SFI&rsquo;s outreach programmes, and this transfer of responsibility was not by itself expected to generate cost savings. The integration of these programmes has achieved economies of scale, minimised duplication of effort, and contributed to operational efficiencies.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA) to the Government<\/td><td>The Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser was included in the bodies due for critical review under the Public Sector Reform initiative.

The report highlights a wide range of issues in relation to pension charges and identifies that there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency of charges.  The report shows that small percentages can add up to big reductions in a pension fund over time.<\/p><p>  The launch of the Report was followed by a three month consultation with stakeholders.  There was a broad range of views expressed in the submissions received as well as a range of suggestions and proposals aimed at improving various aspects of the pension charging environment.

I am very appreciative of the support and expertise provided by the group to the Department and look forward to their continuing role in this regard. <\/p><p><b>2014 Technical Advisory Group Membership List (includes alternates)<\/b><table><tr><th>Category<\/th><th>TAG Representative<\/th><th>Organisation <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Central Statistics Office<\/td><td>Tom McMahon<\/td><td>Central Statistics Office<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Pamela Lafferty<\/td><td>Central Statistics Office<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Patrick Foley<\/td><td>Central Statistics Office<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Academic experts<\/td><td>Tim Callan <\/td><td>Economic and Social Research Institute<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Bertrand Ma&igrave;tre<\/td><td>Economic and Social Research Institute<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Helen Russell<\/td><td>Economic and Social Research Institute<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Dorothy Watson<\/td><td>Economic and Social Research Institute<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Chris Whelan<\/td><td>UCD School of Sociology<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Brian Nolan<\/td><td>UCD College of Human Sciences<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Social Partners<\/td><td>Dr Se&aacute;n Healy S.M.A.<\/td><td>Social Justice Ireland (C&amp;amp;V Pillar)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Caroline Fahey<\/td><td>Society of St Vincent de Paul (C&amp;amp;V Pillar)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Kara McGann<\/td><td>IBEC (Employers' Pillar)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Gillian Westbrook<\/td><td>ICSA (Farmers' Pillar)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Peter Rigney<\/td><td>ICTU (Unions' Pillar)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Loraine Mulligan<\/td><td>ICTU (Unions' Pillar)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Government Departments<\/td><td>Brian McCann<\/td><td>D\/Children and Youth Affairs<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Diarmuid Reidy<\/td><td>D\/Education and Skills<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Gillian Golden<\/td><td>D\/Education and Skills<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Helen McGrath<\/td><td>D\/Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Geraldine Luddy<\/td><td>D\/Health<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Tim McCarthy<\/td><td>D\/Health<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Sin&eacute;ad Quill<\/td><td>D\/Health - Office for Older People<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Gr&aacute;inne Whelan<\/td><td>D\/Justice and Equality<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Pamela McLoughlin<\/td><td>D\/Justice and Equality<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Tom Maguire<\/td><td>D\/Justice and Equality<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Pauline Moreau<\/td><td>D\/Justice and Equality - Gender Equality Division<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Joan O'Shea<\/td><td>D\/Public Expenditure and Reform<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Colin Menton<\/td><td>D\/Public Expenditure and Reform<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Yvonne Jackson<\/td><td>D\/Taoiseach<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Edel Cooke<\/td><td>D\/Taoiseach<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State agencies<\/td><td>Laurence Bond<\/td><td>Equality Authority<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Eithne Fitzgerald<\/td><td>National Disability Authority <\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Marion Wilkinson<\/td><td>National Disability Authority <\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Helen Johnston<\/td><td>National Economic and Social Development Office<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Department of Social Protection <\/td><td>Jim Walsh<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Kasey Treadwell Shine<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Joanne Mulholland<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Elaine O'Neill<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Brian King<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Paul Morrin<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600061#WRL00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":429,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600061#WRL00350"},{"type":"question","counter":430,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[1921\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600061#WRL00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when an application for invalidity pension appeal will be finalised in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1087","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":431,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who has decided to hold an oral hearing in this case on 20 January 2014.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the unemployed and keep jobseekers close to the labour market.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies.  Given the scale of the unemployment challenge, the key objective of labour market policy is to keep those on the Live Register close to the labour market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. Persons from the Live Register availing of activation measures will get an opportunity to engage in employment, training and work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.  In this context, the major elements of this Department&rsquo;s response are set out in the Pathways to Work policy which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created are filled by people from the Live Register, with a particular focus on those who are long term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment.<\/p><p>  The Pathways to Work policy and the establishment of the new integrated INTREO service will transform the nature and level of engagement between our employment and income support services and the unemployed. The Pathways to Work policy aims, with regards to supports for unemployed persons, to:<\/p><p>- Provide all registered unemployed people with efficient, work-focused income supports together with access to the information and the advice required to help them plan and action a pathway back into employment.<\/p><p>- Provide unemployed people, in particular people who are long-term unemployed and young unemployed people, with opportunities to enhance their job prospects through value-adding work experience, education and training activities.<\/p><p>  In terms of the first strand, there were 122,300 activation referrals via the Group Engagement process in the first eleven months of 2013 (up from 63,700 in 2012), and 105,900 one-to-one referrals in the same time period (compared to 100,200 in 2012).  During the Group Engagement process and the one-to-one interviews, unemployed persons are advised of the supports that are available to them, and of their responsibilities as jobseekers.<\/p><p>  In terms of enhancing job prospects, the Department has a number of supports available for jobseekers:<\/p><p>- JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme) provides work experience placements for interns for a 6 month or a 9 month period.  The aim of JobBridge is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills.  Some 6,400 people are currently participating on this scheme.<\/p><p>- The JobsPlus incentive scheme encourages employers to recruit long-term unemployed people.  The incentive is payable monthly in arrears, over a 2-year period.  There are 2 levels of incentive: &euro;7,500 for recruits unemployed for more than 12 but less than 24 months and &euro;10,000 for recruits unemployed for more than 24 months.<\/p><p>- In addition, the Department also manages a number of schemes providing temporary employment for the long-term unemployed on works and services of value to the community.  There were almost 31,000 people participating on Community Employment and T&uacute;s in December 2013.  There are also 3,000 places in 2014 on Gateway, a local authority labour activation scheme that provides short-term work and training opportunities for long-term unemployed people who have been on the Live Register for over 2 years.<\/p><p>- In terms of up-skilling, the Back to Education Allowance scheme run by my Department provides income maintenance, along with a contribution to education costs, for unemployed people returning to further or higher education.  Approximately 26,000 people participated in the BTEA in the last academic year.<\/p><p>- Two further up-skilling options available are the Part-time Education Option (PTEO) and Education Training and Development Option (ET&amp;amp;D). Both PTEO and ET&amp;amp;D are designed to facilitate jobseekers who wish to engage in part time day, evening or weekend courses or more intensive short duration courses of education and training while retaining their jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.  The PTEO allows participants to attend part-time day\/evening or weekend courses of education or training and retain their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment while an entitlement exists provided that they continue to satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking employment on an on-going basis.  Payment is made at the same rate as the primary payment and no maximisation of payments occurs.  The ET&amp;amp;D allows participants to attend certain courses of education, training or development of short duration and retain their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment while an entitlement exists.  Participants are exempt from engaging in job search but must be available for employment should an opportunity arise.<\/p><p>  The Pathways to Work Strategy sets a target of moving 20,000 of the 180,800 people who were on the Live Register and fully unemployed for over a year at the beginning of 2012, into employment by the end of 2013.  By the end of 2013, 26,611 of this group were known to have moved into employment.  Of these, 19,695 had entered full-time employment and left the Live Register, and 6,916 had entered part-time employment.  As there can be some time lag in the reporting of new entries to employment by the relevant employers, it is likely that these figures will increase retrospectively as further records become available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600061#WRL02100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":457,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[2014\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600061#WRL02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when her Department will introduce a scheme to allow jobseekers gain work experience with local authorities by helping cleansing departments and other Government Departments; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":458,"content":"<p>Gateway was introduced by the Department of Social Protection to deliver on the policy objectives set out in Pathways to Work and is designed to bridge the gap between unemployment and re-entering the workforce.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in the Irish market can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at   . <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>  -  a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<\/p><p>  -  a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. <\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  In designing the procurement process for the intervention, my Department will be required to comply with the EU State aid rules which set out conditionality in relation to, among other things, technology neutrality. As different technological solutions exist to provide broadband services, no particular technology or network platform should be excluded. The guidelines emphasise the role of fibre is assisting the delivery of high speed broadband through various platforms.<\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600063#WRN02500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":542,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600063#WRN02550"},{"type":"question","counter":543,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[2097\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600063#WRN02600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide details of each allocation from his Department&rsquo;s expenditure budget to registered charities in each of the past three years.","asker":"1091","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":544,"content":"<p>The funding of registered charities is not a direct function of my Department.

These persons are registered for the purposes of employment or study, to operate a business or as a dependant family member of an Irish or EEA national residing in the State. There are several channels open to non-EEA migrants of any nationality who wish to reside in Ireland.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation operates the employment permit system which offers the opportunity of working in Ireland to those with specific skill sets or qualifications.  The State is also actively promoting Ireland as an education destination for overseas students and there are over 30,000 non-EEA national students in Ireland at present.  Non-EEA national students are entitled to work in Ireland during the course of their studies and, on qualification at degree level, may avail of the Irish Graduate Scheme &ndash; a post study pathway that can lead to permanent residence.

As the Deputy is asking whether my Department has any such bodies under its remit I can answer that there are no quasi autonomous NGO&rsquo;s which fall under the remit of my Department.<\/p><p>  The details (since 2011) of the merger, reform or abolition of agencies under the remit of my Department is outlined below:<\/p><p><b>Legal Aid Board<\/b><\/p><p>  Responsibility for the administration of three ad-hoc Criminal Legal Aid Schemes was transferred to the Legal Aid Board.<\/p><p><i>Garda Station Legal Advice Scheme<\/i><\/p><p>  The Scheme provides that where a person is detained in a Garda station for the purpose of the investigation of an offence and s\/he has a legal entitlement to consult with a solicitor and the person's means are insufficient to enable him\/her to pay for such consultation, such consultations with solicitors will be paid for by the State.  Responsibility for the administration of the Scheme was transferred to the Legal Aid Board on 1 October 2011.<\/p><p><i>Legal Aid Custody Issues Scheme<\/i><b><i><\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  This Scheme provides payment for legal representation in the High Court and the Supreme Court for certain types of cases not covered by civil legal aid or the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme namely (i) Habeas Corpus Applications, (ii) Supreme Court Bail Motions, (iii) Judicial Reviews, (iv) Extradition Applications and European Arrest Warrants and (v) High Court Bail Motions.  Responsibility for the administration of the Scheme was transferred to the Legal Aid Board on 1 June 2012. <\/p><p><i>Criminal Assets Bureau Legal Aid Scheme<\/i><\/p><p>  The Scheme is applicable to persons who are respondents and\/or defendants in any court proceedings brought by, or in the name of, the Criminal Assets Bureau including court proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, the Revenue Acts or the Social Welfare Acts and applications made by the Director of Public Prosecutions under Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.  Responsibility for the administration of the Scheme was transferred to the Legal Aid Board on 1 January 2014.<\/p><p><sup><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/sup>  It is proposed that the administration of the main Criminal Legal Aid Scheme will be transferred to the Legal Aid Board on foot of new legislation which is currently being drafted.  This move will be in keeping with the international model for the delivery of legal aid and advice services and will achieve a more dedicated focus to the management and delivery of Criminal Legal Aid.  It would be premature at present to commit to a date for the transfer of the scheme. <\/p><p><sup><\/sup>  In addition, the Board took on responsibility for the Family Mediation Service in November 2011 which had been under the auspices of the Family Support Agency up to that point. A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common. Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the Dublin District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service. Similar initiatives have now been introduced in Cork and Naas and are being evaluated.   <\/p><p><b>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission<\/b><\/p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 allowed for the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to replace the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Appeal Board. <\/p><p>  The current status of the Complaints Board is that the final case against it was struck out by the Supreme Court on 29 November 2013. The repeal of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Complaints) Act 1986 will automatically dissolve the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board and the separate Appeal Board. <\/p><p>  The Board is made up of a Chairperson and 8 members appointed in 2012 for a five year term as it was necessary to have a Board in existence until any outstanding cases had concluded. The members do not receive any fees and their term of office will automatically cease when the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Complaints) Act 1986 is repealed. <\/p><p>  The Appeal Board is made up of a Chairperson, who must be a Judge of the Circuit Court, and two ordinary members. Their term of office expired on 16 December, 2013. No membership fee is paid to the members of the Appeal Board. The two ordinary members received a payment for each sitting of the Board. As there are no longer any cases involving the Complaints Board, the appeal function is not required and no issue arises with the expiry of the term of office.<\/p><p><b>Merger of the Valuation Office, the Property Registration Authority and Ordnance Survey Ireland<\/b><\/p><p>  The CEO Designate of the merged body, who acts as Project Manager for the merger, has been appointed from 1 July 2013. A Project Board, comprising senior representatives of the three Departments concerned as well as the CEO's of the three Agencies, is overseeing the merger. It is anticipated that Ministerial responsibility for the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland will be transferred to the Minister for Justice and Equality early in 2014. In addition, it is planned to bring a General Scheme of a Bill to Government for approval to draft by mid-2014.<\/p><p>  The merger of the Valuation Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Property Registration Authority provides an opportunity for more efficient and cost-effective delivery of land, spatial data and property administration services. Savings in the short to medium term are anticipated from the consolidation of common back office functions such as Human Resources, conventional ICT systems, Financial Management and a potential reduction in the cost of accommodation and software licensing. In the longer term, more efficiencies\/synergies may be achievable in operational areas and through the exploitation, including where possible commercialisation, of combined data sets. <\/p><p><b>The Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority<\/b><\/p><p>  The Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority are in the process of merging to form a new enhanced Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) to promote human rights and equality issues in an efficient effective and coherent way. The draft legislation is at a very advanced stage and I expect to publish this Bill shortly.<\/p><p>I might also mention that the Equality Tribunal now falls under the aegis of the Department Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with effect 1st January, 2013, and is in the process of being merged with the Labour Relations Commission, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the National Employment Rights Authority to form a single Workplace Relations Service.    <font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/p><p>  In the context of the Deputy's question, State Agencies is taken to refer to statutory independent bodies, often (but not exclusively), with a Board which has a governance oversight responsibility for an organisation.

The ISI has rapidly established the necessary infrastructure of trained and accredited insolvency practitioners and intermediaries, and began accepting applications for personal insolvency solutions last September.  A number of these cases have already been referred to the courts for protection orders or final approval, and the ISI expects the volume of such cases to increase significantly in the coming weeks and months.

Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his\/her means are insufficient to enable him\/her to pay for legal representation him\/herself.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the \"gravity of the charge\" or \"exceptional circumstances\", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that an accused person who faces serious charges is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence and if they cannot afford to pay for legal representation, there is a right to legal aid.  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend him\/herself in person or through legal assistance of his\/her own choosing or, if he\/she has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.

There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.<\/p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  Section 2(2)(d) provides that in exercising its jurisdiction under that section, a court shall take into account and may receive evidence or submissions concerning any conviction of the accused person for an offence committed while he or she was on bail.<\/p><p>  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.<\/p><p>  The criminal law takes a serious view of offences committed by persons on bail.  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served. It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.<\/p><p>  I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences continue to be committed by persons on bail. I share that concern and believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.<\/p><p>  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600067#WRR01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":673,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600067#WRR02000"},{"type":"question","counter":674,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[2049\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600067#WRR02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the number of community garda&iacute;; the areas they cover in the constituencies of Dublin North East and Dublin North Central; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I have been actively assessing the damage to the many small Local Authority piers and harbours right around the coast. I am aware of the critical importance of this local pier and harbour infrastructure to the 1900 odd inshore fishing vessels that provide a backbone to our inshore fishing fleet.<\/p><p>  The Government in considering the totality of the impact of the storms decided that the Local Authorities need to do a full assessment of the damage and the costs involved and should revert to Government in the coming weeks. That comprehensive assessment will then enable Government to decide on a fully informed response to the damage that was wreaked on our coastal communities as a result of these exceptionally bad storms.<\/p><p>  On the specific issue of Government support for inshore fishermen for losses of equipment or boats, it is useful to recall that there are a range of grant aid schemes already available to inshore fishermen, which are administered by BIM. <\/p><p>  There have been some reports in the media about the loss, by some inshore fishermen, of their pots. It is not unusual for inshore fishermen to experience some pot losses through the winter. It is too early to fully determine the scale of the losses and if these were widespread.  I will in the coming days be endeavouring to assess the scale of losses that may have occurred.<\/p><p>  In deciding on an appropriate response to the situation that emerges I will have to take account of the fact that EU Law limits the options. The EU requires that any financial assistance provided by Government to the seafood sector must always be considered in terms of what is permissible under EU State Aid rules.  It is clear that under State Aid rules no aid may be given for the replacement of any lost or damaged fishing boats.  <\/p><p>  In relation to pots, the European Fisheries Fund Regulation does allow for financial assistance for purchase of pots but only where the replacement pots provide for more selectivity in relation to by-catch and under size fish.  Any such assistance to purchase fishing gear may not increase the ability of a vessel to catch fish and would be difficult to implement without the risk of breaching State Aid rules.  <\/p><p>  However, while all of these constraints and considerations exist, I am still endeavouring to get a full picture of the situation and when that is to hand I will be in a better position to inform Government and determine what responses are practical and appropriate.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600070#WRU02000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies","counter":802,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600070#WRU02050"},{"type":"question","counter":803,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[1970\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600070#WRU02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of quangos, State agencies or organisations under the remit of his Department that have been merged, reformed or abolished since 2011; the details of each of these measures in tabular form; the cost saving or service delivery improvement which has resulted; how many more he expects to be merged, reformed or abolished and the timeline for same; if he will provide a full list of all agencies and organisations under his remit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":804,"content":"<p>There are currently 12 State Bodies that fall under the aegis of my Department:<\/p><p>1.

The ICC has confirmed that it has systems in place to underpin the welfare of animals participating in coursing events. These include mandatory inspections of hares and coursing venues in advance of the commencement of an event. Greyhounds involved in coursing are subject to the provisions of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and the Code of Practice for the care and welfare of greyhounds, published by Bord na gCon.<\/p><p>The ICC has assured the Department that it goes to great lengths to ensure the highest standards are adhered to during coursing.  The ICC's rules and regulations (Rule 106) accommodate the postponement of meetings if the weather is unfavourable i.e. snowfall, frost or waterlogged ground, which may affect the welfare of both greyhound and \/or hare. The ICC has demonstrated it&rsquo;s willingness to cancel \/ postpone meetings in the face of adverse weather conditions, by way of example, one coursing meeting was cancelled on 23rd   November 2013 due to heavy frost, and this would be a routine practice for all clubs affiliated to the ICC. Most recently meetings were postponed over the Christmas (2013) period due to unfavourable weather conditions.  During extreme weather conditions, it is also the practice of clubs to provide additional food for hares living on hare preserves protected by coursing clubs.  <\/p><p>  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2012, has responsibility for the issuing of an annual licence to the ICC and its affiliated clubs to capture live hares. These licences currently have a total of 26 conditions attached to them.  The conditions of these licences cover a range of items, including veterinary supervision at coursing meetings and a number of requirements attaching to the welfare of hares.<\/p><p>  The ICC ensures that a veterinary surgeon and a control steward are present at all coursing meetings.  In addition to this, veterinary staff from my Department and Rangers from the National Parks and Wildlife Service (part of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht) carry out random inspections during the coursing season to monitor compliance with the licences and the rules governing animal welfare.  <\/p><p>  As a further control, a Coursing Monitoring Committee was established during the 1993\/94 coursing season and is comprised of officials from my Department and representatives from both the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the ICC to monitor developments in coursing and in that regard the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interests of  hares and greyhounds alike.<\/p><p>  A very high proportion (98.09%) of the hares captured for hare coursing were returned to the wild at the end of the 2012\/2013 season. <\/p><p>  The systems that are in place are, in my view, effective and are working well. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600071#WRV01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":830,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600071#WRV01350"},{"type":"question","counter":831,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[2094\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600071#WRV01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide details of each allocation from his Department&rsquo;s expenditure budget to registered charities in each of the past three years.","asker":"1091","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":832,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s contributions to Gorta for the last 3 years in support of their World Food Day Conference were as follows:<\/p><p>  2011 - &euro;18,821<\/p><p>  2012 - &euro;16,681<\/p><p>  2013 - &euro;20,000<\/p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s contributions to Concern were as follows:<\/p><p>   2012 - &euro;1,000  <\/p><p>   2013 - &euro;1,000 <\/p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s ex gratia payments to animal welfare organisations (all registered charities) for the last 3 years were as follows:<\/p><p>   2011- &euro;1,235,000 to 132 animal welfare organisations, <\/p><p>   2012 - &euro;1,365,000 to 140 animal welfare organisations<\/p><p>   2013 - &euro;1,807,100 to 136 animal welfare organisations <\/p><p>   (See detailed lists below).<\/p><p><br \/><table><tr><th><b><font face=\"Times New Roman\">No<\/font><\/b><\/th><th><b><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Applicants Name<\/font><\/b><\/th><th><b><font face=\"Times New Roman\">                                                             Award 2011<\/font><\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><font face=\"Times New Roman\">1<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Times New Roman\">A Dog&rsquo;s Life, Maynooth, Co.

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI), the Child and Family Agency (CFA) and the Ombudsman for Children's Office (OCO).  Up to 31 December, 2013, my Department also funded the Family Support Agency (FSA) and the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB).  The new Child and Family Agency which was established on 1 January, 2014 now has responsibility for the provision of these services along with children and family services previously delivered by the HSE. <\/p><p>  The coming together under one Agency of services previously delivered across three separate organisations provides a platform for the delivery of a more efficient and effective service to vulnerable children and families.  The range of responsibilities under the remit of the Agency will contribute to achievement of the overall vision for the Agency which is seeking to bring about greater integration of services with a focus on early intervention and community engagement.<\/p><p>  In July 2011, the Government decided that the Family Mediation Service should transfer from the Family Support Agency to the Legal Aid Board. This is in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to facilitate the use of mediation in family disputes in order to speed up the legal process, reduce costs and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings. On 26 October 2011, the Minister for Justice and Equality signed the commencement order for Part 16 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 which gave effect to the transfer from 1 November 2011.

The Government has decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet its fiscal and budgetary targets. The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction. This policy requires the health service to reduce its workforce to 94,209 wholetime equivalent employees (WTE) by the end of 2014. This employment ceiling is net of some 4,000 staff who moved to the new Child and Family agency from 1st January 2014.  The ceiling represents a further reduction of 983 posts in 2014 compared with the end 2013 ceiling for the HSE.  However, as the end 2013 ceiling was exceeded by 1,026 the total reduction required in 2014 is 2,009.<\/p><p>  The<b><\/b>Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest<b><\/b>Act 2013 provides for a &quot;grace period&quot; from 1 July 2013 to the end of August 2014.

During this period those retiring and who were subject to the pay reductions under the Act will have their superannuation benefits calculated by reference to the salary scales which applied on 30 June 2013 and will have the revised increment position disregarded.  It is envisaged that this will act as an incentive in encouraging staff to retire in advance of the deadline.  <\/p><p>  In 2013 my Department authorised the introduction of a Targeted Voluntary Redundancy Facility in the HSE and in organisations funded by the HSE under Section 38 of the Health Act 2004.  The purpose is to achieve a permanent reduction in numbers and to facilitate ongoing health sector reform. Voluntary Redundancy will give many managers greater flexibility in implementing the measures needed to remain within reduced budgets and staff ceilings. It will provide scope to reduce employee numbers in the context of changing health sector structures and health reforms.  The Voluntary Redundancy Facility has been made available from 1st January 2014. <\/p><p>  The Voluntary Redundancy Facility will be implemented on a rolling basis as appropriate areas and functions are identified.  It is important to emphasise that there is no automatic right to voluntary redundancy; staff may be offered Voluntary Redundancy in the context of current and future business needs and service provision priorities.  The HSE will operate the employees Targeted Voluntary Redundancy Facility in 2014 and subsequent years as a key element in the reform of the health service.  It will enable the HSE and other service providers to maximise the quantum and quality of services provided with the resources available.  The period of notice required for persons to signal their intent to retire is dependent on the individual's contract of employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600072#WRW01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":869,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600072#WRW01150"},{"type":"question","counter":870,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[1830\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600072#WRW01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress to date in the determination of eligibility for a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":871,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

The Act obliges the HSE to take account of the overall financial situation of an applicant and dependants. If an applicant&rsquo;s means are above the financial thresholds for eligibility  for a medical card or a GP visit card, as set out in the national Guidelines, the HSE examines for any indication of circumstances (medical or social), which might result in undue financial hardship. Eligibility may be granted on a discretionary basis if these circumstances are such that a person cannot access General Practitioner or other medical services, without undue financial hardship. In these cases social and medical issues are considered when determining whether or not undue financial hardship exists for the individual in accessing GP or other medical services.<\/p><p>  There is no (and has never been an) automatic entitlement to a medical card on the basis of a specific illness or medical need. Medical cards are not issued 'automatically' or irrespective of means, even if an applicant is suffering from a serious medical condition.  As medical cards are not awarded on the basis of illnesses or medical conditions, the HSE does not collect data such as illness category, unless it is required for the review procedure.<\/p><p>  Down&rsquo;s Syndrome is covered under the Long Term Illness Scheme for which entitlement applies, irrespective of means. Where persons with Down&rsquo;s Syndrome are not eligible for a medical card following an assessment of their means,  the HSE can provide their full requirements in respect of prescribed medicines and appliances free of charge through this statutory entitlement. Public dental, ophthalmic and aural treatment and appliances are also available free of charge to children and in respect of any difficulties identified at child health or school health examinations.

No new statutory bodies have been established in the health sector since the formation of this Government. <\/p><p>  Three bodies, the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery, National Social Workers Qualifications Board and the Children Acts Advisory Board have been dissolved since March 2011.  The Public Service Reform document on 17th November 2011 identified three agencies under the aegis of this Department to be rationalised, amalgamated or abolished in 2012 - the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery, the Opticians Board and the National Cancer Registry Board.    The National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery was dissolved on the 31<sup>st<\/sup>   December, 2011. The Opticians Board is to be subsumed into the Health and Social Care Professionals Council. The general scheme of Bill for this purpose was approved by Government and assigned to the Office of the Parliamentary Draftsman in July 2013.  It is expected to be published in Q1 2014. In regard to the National Cancer Registry Board, with the ongoing changes to the structure of the HSE,  and the fact that the Health Information Bill has not yet been enacted, I consider that it would not be appropriate to subsume the Registry into the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme at this time. <\/p><p>  HIQA's role in the area of health and social care is expanding and it is envisaged that in future HIQA will be the body responsible for the licensing of public and private healthcare facilities. The future of the Mental Health Commission will be considered in the context of any re-alignment or amalgamation of the health and social care regulatory bodies. The move to Universal Health Insurance will have implications for the National Treatment Purchase Fund and Health Insurance Authority. I intend to restructure the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board so that it focuses specifically on the capital project, allowing the paediatric hospitals working together as the Children's Hospital Group to focus on the other functions previously held by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board. With regard to the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, I have decided that it should continue to operate in its present form for a further period and the matter will be kept under review with a view to proceeding with the integration with CORU when it is operationally ready to assume the functions involved, which is expected to be 3 or 4 years.<\/p><p>  The extent of savings will vary between organisations and the majority of staff will be redeployed to other public service bodies, as was the case with the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery. Efficiencies will derive from economies of scale and the elimination of duplication in areas such as recruitment, procurement, payroll and ICT systems. Savings will also arise from the dissolution of Agency Boards, some of which attract payment of travel and subsistence and\/or Board fees.<table><tr><th><div>Non Commercial Agencies<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Dental Council <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Food Safety Authority of Ireland<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Food Safety Promotions Board (Safefood)<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Health and Social Care Professionals Council (CORU)<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Health Information and Quality Authority<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Health Insurance Authority <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Health Research Board<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Irish Blood Transfusion Service <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Irish Medicines Board <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Medical Council <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Mental Health Commission<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>National Cancer Registry Board<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>National Paediatric Hospital Development Board <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>National Treatment Purchase Fund<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Opticians Board <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Commercial Agency<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>VHI<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600073#WRX02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":922,"content":"<p>Question No. 318 answered with Question No. 318.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Issues","counter":923,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600073#WRX02150"},{"type":"question","counter":924,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[1987\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600073#WRX02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an appeal in respect of persons (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":925,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600073#WRX02300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":926,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600073#WRX02350"},{"type":"question","counter":927,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[1996\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600073#WRX02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the funding being provided for disability in 2014; the progress made to date in the provision of services for school leavers in 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These have resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001\/2002 levels. <\/p><p>  A major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including <\/p><p>-   significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, <\/p><p>-   a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, <\/p><p>-   timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and<\/p><p>-   reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.<\/p><p>      The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nine EU member states.  The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.<\/p><p>  \tThe gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs.<\/p><p>  A new agreement was also reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry.  Since 1 November 2012, the HSE only reimburses generic products which are priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate. It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;148 million in 2014.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which came into operation on the 24th of June, introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients. It is estimated that this system will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.<\/p><p>  Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines. Generic substitution will be introduced incrementally with the IMB prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State. The Board is in the process of reviewing an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines.   They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. <\/p><p>  The first List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August 2013. The IMB is updating the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products on an ongoing basis and it expects to complete the assessment of  the top 20 priority medicines by end Quarter 1 2014.  A further list of 20 priority groups of products will then be identified and it is anticipated that the assessment of this list will be completed by the IMB by Quarter 4 2014. The process will then continue until all relevant medicinal products on the reimbursable list have been assessed. <\/p><p>  Once a List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products is published by the IMB  a two stage price reduction process gets underway. First, under the terms of the 2012 APMI Agreement, the price of all relevant products fall by 20%, e.g. atorvastatin prices were reduced from 1st September.   Secondly, the legislation provides that the HSE may set a reference price for groups of interchangeable products published on the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products with a view to introducing further significant price cuts. Taking both price reductions into account, atorvastatin prices are down 70% since the introduction of generic substitution.<\/p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. The first reference price for atorvastatin products was implemented on 1 November 2013. The reference price for esomeprazole 20mg products was implemented on 1 January 2014 and it is expected that reference prices for esomaprazole 40mg and rosuvastatin products will be implemented on 1 February 2014. The HSE will continue to implement reference prices for the remaining groups of interchangeable products published by the IMB on an on-going basis throughout 2014. It is expected that 80% of the off-patent market by value will be reference priced by end 2014. Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600074#WRY00300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":936,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600074#WRY00350"},{"type":"question","counter":937,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[2010\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600074#WRY00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the action being taken to deal with patients on trolleys in hospitals; his views on the number of patients on trolleys in Beaumont Hospital over the past month; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":938,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600074#WRY00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staff Responsibilities","counter":939,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600074#WRY00550"},{"type":"question","counter":940,"qnumday":324,"qnumall":"[2011\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011600074#WRY00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the role and responsibilities of the CEO of the Health Service Executive; if he will outline his targets and details of his performance package; if a bonus is payable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":941,"content":"<p>Under current legislative arrangements the HSE does not have a Chief Executive Officer.

As at the end of November, 2013 the recruitment process is complete for 376.5 or 91% of the 414 posts approved in 2012 with a further 17.5 or 4% of posts in the final stages of the recruitment process.<\/p><p>  Of the posts approved in 2013, the recruitment process is complete for 137.5 or 29% of the posts, 134.5 or 28% have been accepted and are being processed for clearance and 165 or 35% are at earlier stages of the recruitment or HR process.  The posts related to the &euro;35 million allocated in 2013 will continue to come on stream and are targeted to be completed in Quarter 2 of 2014.  A tabular breakdown of the current position in relation to 2012 and 2013 posts is shown below.<\/p><p>  There are, however, a number of posts for which there are difficulties in identifying suitable candidates due to factors including availability of qualified candidates and geographic location. <font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>  The HSE's National Recruitment Service is currently working to ensure that the remaining posts will be filled as soon as possible, from existing panels or through competition in the absence of panels, at the earliest opportunity.  Options to enable more local recruitment are also being considered where this will assist in filling specific posts.  I have received assurances from the HSE that the recruitment process for these posts is being given priority within the HSE.<\/p><p>  In Budget 2014, the Government has again re-committed to the continued development of our mental health services in these extremely challenging times, where the options for additional expenditure generally are very constrained.  &euro;20 million is being ringfenced for the further development of our mental health services in 2014.  This means that, despite serious resource pressures overall, funding of &euro;90m has been made available since 2012 up to end of 2014, which has been specifically ear-marked for mental health and suicide prevention.<\/p><p>  This funding will enable the HSE to continue to develop and modernise our mental health services in line with the recommendations of<i> A Vision for Change <\/i>and will allow for the recruitment of between 250 and 280 additional staff to further enhance our -<\/p><p>-   Adult Community Mental Health Teams<\/p><p>-   Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams<\/p><p>-   Specialist Mental Health Teams<\/p><p>  The HSE is currently preparing a National Mental Health Divisional Plan which will detail further its objectives in 2014 and will include prioritised actions for each Mental Health Catchment Area.  Decisions on the regional breakdown of the new 2013 posts will be made following a business case and analysis process.  This will ensure that the required professional grades are recruited to fill identified gaps in the service.  The recruitment process for these new posts will commence in the first Quarter of 2014, with all posts targeted to be in place by Quarter 4 of 2014.<\/p><p><b>Progress in Recruitment of 2012 posts per
