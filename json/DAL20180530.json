For the beef and sheep sectors, they account for almost 100% of net income.  Therefore, the stakes are immensely high for the farming sector and farm families.  Unless we can ensure the budget is protected and that the proposed cuts are reversed, we will see farmers deciding to leave the sector as it will become unsustainable for some to make a living from agriculture.

When the Commission published its proposals on CAP, there were a number of member states that criticised the proposals specifically on the basis that they did not go far enough in terms of cutting the budget.

It is also important to note that, following publication, the draft regulations will be the subject of detailed negotiations before final agreement.

The reality is that small farmers, certainly in the west and on hilly ground, cannot survive on farm income alone and very often have to have off-farm income.  This is one of the things that is leading in many cases to the abandonment of the uplands, where we see farmers abandoning the land and taking other options, such as forestry or just selling the land and getting rid of it.  The truth is it is bad for our community and for the whole farming sector if it goes in that direction.  Every effort needs to be made in the negotiations to ensure the definition of what a farmer is, and what farming is, is that the land is being farmed.

They may not be able to generate a high income owing to those constraints, but they perform a host of other valuable services in the protection of the environment.

Agroforestry is positive for animal welfare, improves biodiversity and can prevent nutrient run-off when planted in strategic locations.  Some farmers who may not be inclined to plant trees may see agroforestry as a first step in terms of a possible commitment to more traditional forestry.  By engaging in agroforestry farmers may begin to see timber production as part of the farming mix in terms of climate mitigation and adding to the overall productivity of their farm.<\/p>  <p>  Applications for agroforestry are considered by my Department for silvopastoral systems such as pasture, grazing, silage or hay.  Other systems may be considered on a site-to-site basis, however, as long as the tree stocking rate is between 400 and 1,000 trees per hectare, that is, at least 0.5 ha in area and at least 20 m wide.  Acceptable tree species include oak, sycamore and cherry.  Other broadleaves and conifers will be considered on a site-to-site basis, including other native species.  The planting of fruit and nut trees is also provided for under agroforestry and these species can account for up to 15% of the trees planted.<\/p>  <p>  A modest target of 55 ha of agroforestry was set in the forestry programme.  The response has been far below this level, however, at just 6 ha planted during the first three years of the programme.  The recently completed midterm review concluded that there is very little tradition in Ireland in agroforestry and this is most likely contributing to the slow uptake.  The premium levels on offer were also considered to be insufficient to encourage farmers to get involved in this land use.  The cost of tree shelters was contributing also to the high cost of establishment, and this also made agroforestry less attractive to farmers.<\/p>  <p>  Following the midterm review, significant increases have been introduced for agroforestry, with the annual premium payment increasing from &euro;260 per hectare to up to &euro;660 per hectare.  The establishment grant was also increased from &euro;4,450 per hectare to &euro;6,660 per hectare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000006#D01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1527674100,"counter":44,"content":"<p>The Minister of State will have two further opportunities to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000006#D01200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1527674100,"counter":45,"content":"<p>There is a lot at stake in the area of afforestation and forestry.

COFORD, the National Council for Forest Research and Development, recommended that to reach the afforestation levels necessary, we need to plant double that -10,000 to 15,000 ha.

In south-west Norway, the forest cover was increased from 0% to 50% in 50 years, and now 70% of the income for the farmers in the area is from forestry.  This is because there were supports and grants to encourage the natural regeneration of forests, not forestry according to the industrial or commercial model.  It worked brilliantly.

This followed an increase in aggregate farm income of 3.6% in 2016 and 2.3% in 2015.  Last week Teagasc released preliminary results of its national farm survey for 2017, which indicated that average family farm income was the highest on record at almost &euro;31,400, a 32% increase on 2016, driven largely by a 65% increase in dairy farm incomes to over &euro;86,000 on average.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted there are significant differences in family farm income depending on the system of farming and the size of the farm.  Average income on cattle rearing farms increased by 1% to &euro;12,700 and on sheep farms it increased by 8% to &euro;16,900.  Average income on cattle finishing farms decreased by 1% to &euro;16,700.  Dairy farms are consistently the most profitable farms, both on an average per farm and per hectare basis.  However, it should be borne in mind that almost all dairy farms are classified as full-time farms in terms of the labour input required.  Most cattle farms and the majority of sheep farms are classified as part-time in terms of labour input requirements.  Dry stock cattle and sheep farms have a significant dependence on direct payments, which typically account for at least 100% of average farm income on these farms.  This has not changed in recent years.  Most dry stock farmers have off-farm sources of income, whether from off-farm employment of the farm holder or the spouse, State pensions or other social protection payments.<\/p>  <p>  The Food Wise 2025 strategy includes actions to support farmers in improving the competitiveness and profitability of their enterprises.  This includes actions aimed at helping farmers to improve productivity, manage the impact of price volatility and adopt new technologies.  CAP direct payments, Ireland's rural development plan and our agri-taxation system include supports to incentivise land mobility, inter-generational transfer and farm restructuring, all of which are intended to improve farm competitiveness and sustainability, and to maximise the contribution of farm families to the local rural economy.

For very many farmers, the issue is, as the Minister states, 100% of the income comes from those payments.  That is the problem.  For very many of them, the payments are too low and they are not able to manage.  There is an opportunity with CAP to do something about that with basic and direct payments.  I suggest there should be targeting of small farmers and, for example, perhaps the first 15 ha could see a higher payment rate, the next 15 ha could see a medium payment rate and there would be a lower rate for the remainder.  Most of the basic payment would be front-loaded towards the smaller family farm.  Across Europe and the world, it is the model most people want.  On the other side we have the areas of natural constraint, ANC, payments and we need to target them more so as to ensure the smaller family farm gets more of those payments.<\/p>  <p>  The problem is many sectors, particularly sheep and cattle or suckler cow farmers do not have other options.

With the last CAP up to 2020 there was a redistributive effort put into payments that will see in the region of &euro;100 million move from those with a higher per hectare payment to those below the average payment.  It is inevitable that there will be a continuation of that trend of redistribution.

This is all the more relevant after the United Kingdom&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union, which presents significant new challenges for the agrifood sector, in particular. <\/p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agrifood exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Persian Gulf region.  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025, I led a very successful trade mission in February 2017 to the Persian Gulf region.  It covered the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and was followed by an extensive trade mission to the United States and Mexico in June.  Both markets offer many elements that are very attractive to Irish exporters.  The United States is the largest food and beverage market in the world and has a population of 324 million people.  Around 35 million Americans also claim Irish ancestry.  Mexico has a population of 127 million, making it the 11th largest country in the world in population terms and the 15th largest economy in the world, with projections that it will move into the top five by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  Later in 2017, during a trade mission to Japan and South Korea in November, I was accompanied by 40 representatives of the food sector, as well as by experts from my Department, the CEO of Bord Bia and senior representatives from Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc.  It was an opportune time to bring a delegation of Ireland&rsquo;s food leaders to that part of the world, given that the European Union had concluded a free trade agreement with South Korea, as well as concluding an economic partnership agreement with Japan in December 2017.  Japan and South Korea are markets of high potential for beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat exports; therefore, it is important that we raise the profile of Irish agrifood enterprises that already have access to these markets and make progress in negotiating access for others.<\/p>  <p>  Following a further trade mission to the United States and Canada in February, earlier this month I led a trade mission to China and Hong Kong.  It was an extremely successful mission in the development of our ever-growing partnership with China.  For example, being present at one of the world&rsquo;s largest food trade exhibitions in Shanghai allowed me to reinforce the positive message about the quality and sustainability of Irish agrifood exports to Asian buyers.  I was also fortunate to secure meetings with three senior Chinese Ministers.

The issues of incorrect registrations of children and of illegal adoptions are not news or something we learned about only yesterday.

The Minister told the Seanad:<\/p><blockquote>[T]he State now recognises that there were also children who were incorrectly registered as the children of people other than their birth parents.  This could serve to remove any formal record linking a birth parent with his or her birth child.

We know that incorrect or illegal registrations are not new.  The Deputy is correct in that regard.  We know that it was a historical practice and one which was probably commonplace.  Journalists have written about it in recent years and adoption rights campaigners have raised it publicly.  We all know the tragic story of the wonderful Philomena Lee and her son, Michael Hess, whom she never got to meet.  What is new is that we have clear documentary evidence because of the fact that St. Patrick's Guild transferred its records to Tusla, which has been going through them over the past year or so.

There will be other family members involved.  Sisters and brothers who believed they were blood relatives will find out that this was not the case.

Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Zappone, confirmed what so many previous Governments had known for decades.  She finally revealed that 126 babies were illegally adopted from St. Patrick's Guild between 1949 and 1969.  These babies had their births falsely registered to their adopted parents.  They are, as we speak, in the dark as to where they came from.  At the weekend, we thought we had finally closed the door on the historic mistreatment of women at the hands of a conservative state and yet today that door is wide open again.<\/p>  <p>  Swift action must now be taken to right what is another grave injustice.  I acknowledge that the Minister has taken the initiative.  However, it must be said that successive Governments have known of these scandals and yet they failed to name them and act, despite ample documentary evidence.  Campaigners have been raising these issues with successive Governments since at least 2002.  In fact, they raised the specific matter of St. Patrick's Guild in 2003 with the then Fianna F&aacute;il children's Minister but no action was taken.  Over the years, the Adoption Rights Alliance has raised the specific issue of illegal adoption with successive Ministers, with the joint Oireachtas committee and with the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  In fact, the Adoption Rights Alliance, in dogged pursuit of answers and action, issued a paper which gave prominence to illegal adoption to each Minister at the Department of Children and Youth Affairs since 2011 and yet no significant action ever followed.  It is only now, in 2018, that we are finally seeing some movement.<\/p>  <p>  There are citizens who were illegally adopted but have absolutely no idea that they are adoptees.  Many have lived for decades unaware of their identities and with no access to their records.  This has practical consequences in terms of health care and hereditary conditions.  They live under a closed secret system that stigmatises their very existence.  Many will want to know who their birth parents are and now it might be too late.  That is unforgivable.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Taoiseach has proposed an investigation and I want to ask him specific questions regarding what is proposed with the aim, the scope, the resourcing and the terms of reference.  Does the Taoiseach accept that these were illegal adoptions?  Will the Government include all agencies, individuals and homes involved in adoption in the State?  Will the Government include the estimated 2,000 babies who were illegally sent to the United States of America?  Will the Government ensure that no affected person is left behind?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000013#L00300","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1527678300,"counter":142,"content":"<p>We use the terms &quot;incorrect or illegal registrations&quot; rather than &quot;illegal adoptions&quot; because technically these were not adoptions at all, but perhaps that is splitting hairs and not the most relevant point at this stage.<\/p><p>Deputy McDonald is correct that this is not something new.  We have known that this practice existed in the past.  We suspect that it was quite commonplace.  Journalists, such as Conall &Oacute; F&aacute;tharta in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>, have written about it for years.  Civil society advocates, such as the Adoption Rights Alliance, have raised this issue with all parties in the House and at all-party committees for years, as the Deputy correctly said.  Many of us will have been affected by the film, &quot;Philomena&quot;, telling the story of Philomena Lee and, of course, her son, Michael Hess, whose grave she visited but who she never got to meet.<\/p><p>What is different now is that as a result of the transfer of records from St. Patrick's Guild to Tusla, we have clear documentary evidence because of this marker, &quot;Adopted at birth&quot;.  There is clear evidence in those records of over 100 people who were adopted in this way.  That evidence exists and it is important that we deal with it.<\/p><p>Some people have suggested that after exiting a dark tunnel last Saturday, we have entered a new one with this latest story about incorrect registrations.  I do not believe that is correct.  I believe we are different country now.  The past is a foreign country but we must acknowledge it and deal with those issues from the past.  Even though it may be 50, 60 or 70 years ago, we still have responsibility to our fellow citizens to read that dark chapter.<\/p><p>What was done was wrong.  What was done robbed children, our fellow citizens, of their identity.  It was an historic wrong that we must face up to.  On behalf of the Government, I am very sorry for it.  We will never be reconciled with our past until we are truthful about it.  Throughout her career, the Minister, Deputy Zappone, has been steadfast in her determination to force this country to acknowledge the truth about its history and I believe she has done us some real service here.<\/p><p>Our priority now, of course, is to inform those people affected.  Social workers experienced in this area will be contacting the birth mothers where they are alive, the parents who brought our fellow citizens up who were involved in these illegal registrations and party to them will be contacted as well and given the opportunity to talk to the children they brought up, and the individuals who were illegally registered will, of course, be contacted as well.  This will be done in a sensitive and private way.  Nobody will get a knock on the door and suddenly have this information disclosed to their family.  It will be done applying all of the best social work practice available.<\/p><p>What will now happen, on the Minister's initiative, is a targeted sampling analysis of the records from the other adoption societies to see whether there is a similar marker or evidence of these illegal registrations.  If there is, it will be a requirement to go through over 100,000 records.  This is potentially a mammoth task, but it will now be done.<\/p><p>What people want is not retribution.  What they want is information about their identities.  They have a right to know who they are.  They have a right to know their birth story.

Does the Taoiseach accept that what the Minister, Deputy Katharine Zappone, has revealed thus far is just the tip of the iceberg?  Yesterday's revelations account for one agency.  We estimate that there were 182 such agencies.  While initially a sampling exercise might be necessary, a sampling exercise, in and of itself, will not cut it.

Even the parents who brought up the children, who were involved in and party to the illegal registrations, will find it very difficult because they probably believed at the time that they were doing something right in bringing a child into their home, but we know now that it was not right.  We need to share the information and the truth with those fellow citizens of ours who were illegally registered in this way, or illegally adopted, if the Deputy prefers to use that term.  I have no difficulty in using it.  What will happen now is that there will be an initial scoping and sampling exercise to look at the records of the other adoption societies.  If it indicates, as I said in my previous response, that there is evidence of illegal registrations, we will engage in a full analysis of those records.

They shone a light on the lives of women in Ireland and the reality of people's lives.  It was an unveiling of the wrongs done to women, as our colleague, Deputy Clare Daly, so eloquently put it yesterday in the Chamber.  There was an attitude that prevailed for so long that others knew better.  Thankfully, that attitude has slowly been demolished.  Yesterday saw the latest revelations of another failure by the State and those who controlled our society.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, announced details of illegal adoptions where the birth details of children had been misclassified.  The word \"misclassified\" is not appropriate as it sounds very innocuous.  It is not what it is - an illegal adoption.  It is high time we dealt with issues that have for too long been kept in the dark.  <\/p>  <p>  An initial examination by Tusla of the records of St. Patrick's Guild has identified 126 so-called incorrect registrations, more correctly called illegal adoptions.  At least 79 people may be entirely unaware of the true circumstances surrounding their births.  Who they are has been kept from them.  Our identity is central to who we are and how we see ourselves in the world and how we are remembered.  In the coming days people will be contacted and given news that will, in many cases, be shattering for those who believed they knew who they were.  As the Taoiseach said, supports must be put in place for them.  Tusla must be adequately resourced.  The Taoiseach has said it must be done with the utmost sensitivity, but it is essential that Tusla be resourced to do it.  I want the Taoiseach's assurance in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  We need to identify, where possible, how many illegal adoptions happened and to respect the rights of those directly impacted on, those who had their births misclassified, and restore their information and identity to them.  My colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, has been calling for a full audit of the records of adoption societies.  We fully support her in that call.  The Minister has said a sample of records will be taken, as the Taoiseach has just indicated, from each adoption society.  We are talking about what may be needles in haystacks in adopting that approach.  Only a very small number of the 150,000 records may be affected.  It needs to be headed by an international expert and provided with the resources necessary to get to the bottom of the matter.  The right to information must be provided for.  Many adopted persons are still unable to access their own files.<\/p>  <p>  I want to reiterate some of the questions that have not been answered fully.  With reference to Deputy Micheal Martin's question about progressing the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill, will the Taoiseach give us an assurance that it will move much more quickly?  It was published in 2016.  Will he commit to a full audit of all adoption records?  Will he ensure wraparound supports will be put in place for those who will receive this earth-shattering news about who they are and fully resource Tusla to provide them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000014#M00300","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1527678900,"counter":147,"content":"<p>On the audit of records, I answered that question, as did the Minister, Deputy Katharine Zappone.  I have also answered the question about the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  On giving an assurance about the passage of the Bill through the House, I can offer no such assurance as we do not have a majority in the D&aacute;il or the Seanad.  We are seeing other legislation being held up in the House, not by the Government but by Opposition Members.  Two Bills have been delayed in recent weeks which, in turn, holds up the passage of other legislation.  I appeal to Members, particularly Opposition Members, not to hold up legislation because they are not just holding up that legislation but all legislation.  This is the Government that published the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill, legislation that could have been published by any Government in the past ten, 20, 30 or 40 years.  We have done it and the people can trust us to be the ones who will bring it to fruition.  They can trust the Minister, Deputy Katharine Zappone, to do it and she will have the full support of Cabinet in doing so.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has notified the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and transferred scanned versions of the relevant records to it.  It has also informed the Garda of the matter and provided it, at its request, with ten sample cases, although we need to bear in mind that the people who were operating the adoption agencies may be very elderly or deceased.  Nonetheless, we think it is appropriate that the Garda should examine the records with a view to potential prosecutions.  In the first instance, we want to ensure we identify the men and women who are at the centre of this matter and work to get the answers and explanations they want and need and given them the choice or opportunity to meet their birth parents, if they so wish, that is, if their birth parents are still alive and can be contacted.  I am assured that Tusla is keenly aware of the sensitivities involved and will work through experienced information and tracing social workers to ensure the cases are progressed as sensitively and effectively as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  A number of actions are under way.  A social worker has been assigned to each of the 126 individual cases.  They are very much individual cases.  They will provide counselling and support for the individuals involved throughout the process and be resourced in doing so.  There will be no sudden telephone calls or unannounced visits to people's doors.  The process of offering contact and supporting the people affected will be handled very carefully on a case by case basis and at the pace of the individual concerned, the pace he or she believes is appropriate, given his or her personal circumstances.  It is a detailed and methodical process which will take some time, as it must start with identifying the locations of the individuals involved on the basis of information on files that are now decades, in fact, more than half a century old.  Social workers will deliver sensitive information face to face in a supportive environment as far as posisble in a venue of the person's choice.  No information will be delivered over the telephone or by cold calls to people's homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000014#M00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1527678900,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for the additional information he has given us and the fact that social workers have been assigned and that there will be no sudden telephone calls, which is really important.

Tusla already operates an adoption information and tracing service and does it in various locations around the country.

I do not know if I am one of the cases involved.  I am probably not but I have questions about it, as do other members of both my adoptive and birth families.  Thousands of people have very serious questions to ask about, or are living in ignorance of, their true heritage.  They are going to have life-changing events visited upon them.  In some cases, these life-changing experiences are very positive and I was lucky that my experience was just such a positive one.

As Fergus Finlay said this morning, this does not come as a surprise because people have been aware of illegal registrations and illegal adoptions in Ireland for a very long time, perhaps longer than 20 years.  The number of people who participated in it, often the receiving parents, must add up to tens of thousands of people and when a new child arrives in a family without the mother being pregnant there must have been widespread knowledge across society of the existence of this practice.  It must, in fact, have been commonplace in the past.  Journalists have written about it, the Adoption Rights Alliance and others have raised it and it has been raised in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  What is different now is that, because of the analysis of these records, there was a marker on the records indicating \"adopted from birth\", meaning it was possible to identify that a person had been falsely registered as a birth child of parents who were not their birth parents.  It may be harder to find evidence of other cases because they were concealed and records may not exist or have been falsified but we have to do our best to find out as much as we can and give it to the people who have, and always have had, a right to know their birth story, their identity, where they came from and who their parents are, as well as information about their medical history and that of their family.<\/p>  <p>  There are 13,000 or 14,000 people who have come through St. Patrick's Guild and who must be concerned and have a lot of questions.  I can tell them that if they have an adoption order they are not affected by this and are not one of the 126 people to whom we referred.  If they were born before 1946 or after 1969, they are also not affected.  If, however, they were born between those two dates and do not have an adoption order, they may well be affected.

The vast majority of individuals and families who are presenting to our local authorities are either losing their homes because of vacant possession, notices to quit, through repossession, or are living in unacceptable and heavily overcrowded properties, leading to stress and eventually to homelessness.  In almost all these cases, it is known well before the family becomes homeless that they are at risk of homelessness, yet there is no systematic mechanism in place to try to prevent families from entering emergency accommodation or, worse, sleeping rough.  What happens when these families present to local authorities?  In many cases, unfortunately, they are turned away and told to come back when the notice to quit expires or when they have evidence that they can no longer live in overcrowded and unacceptable family accommodation.  Some local authorities are, thankfully, giving families in these situations access to homeless housing assistance payment, HAP, two months or three months out from the notice to quit.  They are then left to their own devices, often in very difficult circumstances, to find HAP accommodation, and without any other supports to deal with some of the issues that there may be in their lives.<\/p><p>This Bill does something very straightforward.  It places an obligation on local authorities to do an assessment of these individuals or families at a minimum of 60 days before they become homeless and, on the basis of that assessment, put in place a plan and additional supports to prevent them from becoming homeless.  This type of legislation was introduced last year and enacted in England and Wales at the start of this year.  Homeless organisations say that it is a model to try to ensure consistency across our local authorities and a greater focus on prevention.  When I raised the matter with the Minister recently, he gave the impression that this is happening across all local authorities.  I genuinely wish it was but it is not.  There is some good practice in some local authorities but it depends on the individual, on the day and on the circumstances affecting the family.  We are saying that there should be a clear obligation.  If a person walks into a local authority today with his or her partner and children and will be homeless in 60 days, the local authority should have to do an assessment, produce a plan and provide the wraparound supports, whether they are currently there or not, to ensure that before that 60 days transpires, those people do not go into emergency accommodation.<\/p><p>We still have the ludicrous situation of an ever-growing number of families who are in the rental accommodation scheme who have vacant possession or notices to quit.  They still are not being told by the local authorities whether they can access HAP, homeless HAP or other options to increase their chances.  I know this is not a straightforward issue.  This is technical legislation and we can argue over its wording but I urge the Minister to look at the spirit and principle of it and see if he could work with it in the future to ensure every effort is made to prevent individuals and families such as these from becoming homeless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000019#R01000","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1527681900,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to introduce the Homeless Prevention Bill.  I am sure all across this city and in towns across the State, there are many families who have received the news that they have dreaded, that their tenancy is being terminated, will not be renewed, and that they are being evicted.  For many, with the rising costs of rents and the lack of accommodation, this means that they are at very serious risk of becoming homeless.  The last thing any of us want to see is anybody becoming homeless.  That is why we need to give more protection to tenants.  In cases where a person has been given a notice to quit and is on the verge of homelessness, we would have supports in place to ensure that the local authority is obliged to work with them.  It is ridiculous that we currently see families who present themselves as homeless being told to come back in a few weeks when they have no roof over their head, and then the local authority will deal with them.  This is totally unacceptable.  Not only that, but we also have a situation where young people leaving a detention facility or people leaving hospital after a long stay or suffering from mental illness may need particular supports in place before they leave their care settings.  This Bill is about giving a legal definition of a person at risk of homelessness.  It is about ensuring that there is a plan in place before a person becomes homeless.  It also aims to give the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and local authorities the power to work with those at risk of homelessness before they are out on the street.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000019#R01100","speaker":"1362"},{"type":"speech","time":1527681900,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000019#R01200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1527681900,"counter":275,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000019#R01300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1527681900,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1527681900,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000019#R01500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1527681900,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000019#R01600","speaker":"1362"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1527681900,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions (Resumed)","time":1527681900,"counter":280,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000019#R01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Programme for Government Implementation","time":1527681900,"counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000019#R01850"},{"type":"question","time":1527681900,"counter":282,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[21242\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000019#R01900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the status of the implementation of A Programme for a Partnership Government.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1527681900,"counter":283,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[21282\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000019#R02000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the implementation of measures in A Programme for a Partnership Government.","asker":"1239","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1527681900,"counter":284,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[21443\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000019#R02100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the status of the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government on political reform.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1527681900,"counter":285,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[23436\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000019#R02200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government regarding increasing the role of Ministers of State; and the progress on same.","asker":"1283","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1527681900,"counter":286,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[23578\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000019#R02300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the implementation of A Programme for a Partnership Government.","asker":"1268","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1527681900,"counter":287,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[23579\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000019#R02400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the status of the implementation of A Programme for a Partnership Government.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1527681900,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government recently approved its second Programme for a Partnership Government annual report which provides a comprehensive update on progress since May 2017.  The report will be laid before the Oireachtas in the near future.  It highlights progress on the specific plans put in place to tackle issues, in the short and longer terms, in the areas of housing, homelessness, education, rural and regional development, job creation, broadband, agriculture and climate action.  It also underlines the emphasis this Government has placed on ensuring that everyone benefits from the strong economic recovery.  Budget 2018 reduced the tax burden on low to middle income earners and weekly social welfare benefits and pensions were increased by &euro;5 for the second year in a row.  Funding has been prioritised to increase front-line posts, providing more teachers, nurses, garda&iacute; and Defence Forces personnel.  These are measures that benefit everyone in our society.<\/p>  <p>  It also demonstrates that the Government that is looking ahead and planning for Ireland's future.  This is reflected in the significant work undertaken in the past year to ensure an effective whole-of-Government approach to planning for Brexit and maintaining Ireland's position in the associated negotiations.  The economy performed strongly in 2017 and job creation was widespread across the country.  Incomes have risen by approximately 2.5% quarter on quarter, income inequality is reducing and poverty and deprivation rates are falling.  The Government has a set of priorities and actions aimed to protect our economy and jobs from the implications of Brexit.  The report acknowledges that despite many measures having been implemented, much remains to be done to bring about further improvements in the areas of housing and health.  The Government is resolute in its determination to deliver results for its citizens in all of these areas.  This is why investing in housing and health feature strongly in Project Ireland 2040, the ten year, &euro;116 billion investment plan.  Despite our best efforts, we do not yet have a health service that current levels of spending should provide.  Guided by the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the recently published health service capacity review, the Government will shortly publish our implementation programme for the future development of Irish health services.

Mel Reynolds, the housing analyst and architect, said today that essentially the figures for the delivery of public housing are being massaged.  He said the actual number of direct builds is half of what was claimed, which was already an abysmally low figure.  The Taoiseach needs to respond to that.  The official housing waiting list is 86,000 but when those on schemes such as the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which are not secure forms of housing, are added to the figure, the number increases to 144,000.<\/p>  <p>  I could not get there today but 12 rapid build houses that took two and a half years to be built in D&uacute;n Laoghaire on a site called George's Place, were opened today.

Even now, only a fraction of the site is being used for the development of public housing because I think the council still wants to sell off parts of it rather than build public housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000020#S01200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1527682500,"counter":301,"content":"<p>The Deputy should conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000020#S01300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1527683100,"counter":302,"content":"<p>We need a clear commitment, as called for by Mr. Mel Reynolds, that public land will be utilised for public housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000021#T00100","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1527683100,"counter":303,"content":"<p>The programme for Government should focus on the future.

I hope the committee's recommendation will be that we set up a short-term committee which will sit until the end of the year to determine how the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly could be implemented within the framework of the new energy and climate plan that we must prepare for the European Union, the first draft of which must be submitted by the end of the year.

It would not bring in outsiders but would concentrate on bringing in the Secretary Generals of key Departments to outline the measures the Government intends to take to raise our game on this issue.

I have housing, education, Rosslare, the coalition, health, employment in the south east and climate change on my list so even with five minutes, it will be hard to do justice to all of the important questions that have been asked but I will do my best.<\/p>  <p>  On affordable housing, I do not have a specific figure.  What we usually do in the context of affordable housing is not so much to provide public money but public land on which affordable housing can be developed.  The intention is to use public land for housing but not just for affordable, council or private housing, but a mix of both public and private in the interests of creating integrated communities.  Some people would like us to go back to previous policies of building very large council-only housing estates similar to Ballymun, Jobstown or Wellview in my own constituency but I do not agree with that approach.  It is better to have integrated communities which is why we will use public lands for mixed developments of private, public and affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of social housing, &euro;6 billion has been allocated in Project Ireland 2040.  We managed to increase the social housing stock by 7,000 last year.  I acknowledge that this was done in lots of different ways.  In some instances, local authorities built housing directly while in other cases they bought housing from developers or acquired it through Part V.  In some cases, local authorities increased their stock through affordable housing bodies like Cl&uacute;id Housing and the Iveagh Trust.  As Deputies know, the latter has provided public housing in this city for decades.  The social housing stock was also increased through the use of long-term leases.  There are lots of ways in which we can expand our social housing stock.  There is a very active but academic debate about statistics ongoing and I know that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and Deputy &Oacute; Broin love to debate those statistics.  I have met and handed over keys to people in my own constituency in places like Waterville, where the council bought houses from a developer, Hansfield, where the council went into partnership with a developer, and Wellview, where the council built houses on its own land and none of the people taking those keys or living in those houses was terribly concerned about what mechanism was used to acquire that social housing.  The people just wanted to live in a property that was owned by the council or, at the very least, leased by it on a very long-term basis and they wanted secure tenancy.  I saw joy on the faces of people who had been in insecure tenancies or had been living in hotels who were moving into council owned or council leased house with secure tenancy.  We can tie ourselves up in knots having very academic arguments about the exact mechanism used to expand our social housing stock but the most important thing is that it happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000021#T00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1527683100,"counter":306,"content":"<p>It is not happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000021#T00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1527683100,"counter":307,"content":"<p>If that involves a combination of measures, including direct build, affordable housing bodies like the Iveagh Trust, acquisitions under Part V, long-term leases or direct purchase from developers, so be it.  That is the best way to do it quickly.  We managed to add 7,000 units to our social housing stock last year.  I understand that Deputy &Oacute; Broin disputes that and says the total is 6,300.  I will not argue over the difference between 6,300 and 7,000 because either way it is a big increase on the previous year's total.  We will increase it by even more next year, with the aim of getting to about 10,000 or 11,000 units per year so that roughly 20% of all new homes built in the country in any given year will be publicly owned.  That is the space in which we need to be.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of education, I answered a question on the Citizens' Assembly yesterday but I want to restate the Government's commitment to greater diversity in education.  We spoke a lot about choice and the right to choose in recent weeks.  I also believe in the right to choice when it comes to education.  Some people will want a Catholic or Protestant education while others will want to send their children to a Gaelscoil, a Gaelchol&aacute;iste, an Educate Together school or to one of the many other types of school that exist.  While it is not always possible to give everyone his or her first choice, we should try to provide for choice and diversity in education.  We recognise that there are more Catholic run or owned schools than are justified given the changes in our population.  We now need to see more schools that are not under Catholic patronage.  This is very much underlined in the Government's commitment to providing 300 to 400 additional multi-denominational and Educate Together schools in the years ahead.  It is also underlined in our commitment to surveying parents on the type of school they want when a new school is being built.  In my constituency, parents in Tyrrelstown decided that they wanted to have a Catholic secondary school and the Le Ch&eacute;ile school has now been built.  It is a beautiful school and is doing really well.  In other parts of my constituency, parents decided that they wanted an Educate Together secondary school.  That has now been built and is also doing really well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000021#T00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1527683100,"counter":308,"content":"<p>We must move on to the next group of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000021#T00700","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Requests","time":1527683100,"counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000021#T00800"},{"type":"question","time":1527683100,"counter":310,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[21442\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000021#T00900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of freedom of information requests his Department has received to date in 2018.

In 2013, my Department received 92 requests while this figure rose to 290 in 2015 and to 344 in 2017.  This represented an increase of 374% over 2013 and the upward trend is continuing this year.  <\/p>  <p>  The majority of requests submitted to my Department are non-personal requests and come from the media.

It appears that PHD Media planned to track online users who engaged with Project Ireland 2040 content so that they could be targeted for future campaigns.  It was also planned to use the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste in future advertisements.  Surely the Taoiseach will accept that this blatant politicisation of Government communications flies in the face of his previous remarks on this issue.

We know that ministerial advisers in Britain have been obliged to resign over the years as a result of this kind of behaviour.  Will the Taoiseach admit that this should not have happened?

When such requests are received, they are assigned to the relevant section of the Department.  Staff deal with requests in addition to their normal duties.  The functions of general examination and primary decision-making have been delegated to assistant principal officers and a few higher executive officers in specialist areas.  The function of internal review has been delegated to officials not below the grade of principal officer.  All requests that are received are monitored by the Department's freedom of information liaison officer.<\/p><p>On the specific question of whether responsibility for requests lies with me or with my officials, section 20 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 provides for the delegation from a Minister to his or her officials of functions relating to the processing of freedom of information requests.

All requests are monitored by the Department's freedom of information liaison officer.<\/p><p>I have been asked about the most recent release of documents relating to the strategic communications unit.  As Deputies will be aware, there have been a number of freedom of information requests and releases.  I have not seen or reviewed the documents in question, but I have seen the online coverage of their release from <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  Its report confirmed that the director of the unit, John Concannon, insisted that all Project Ireland 2040 advertorials should be clearly marked as being from the Government of Ireland.  Having read that story, I formed the opposite view from that of the Deputies.  If I had been given a say in the matter, I would have had these documents released on a slow news day so that they would have received more coverage.<\/p><p>If the report in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>is correct, the documents in question provide further confirmation that many of the allegations made by Deputies against the strategic communications were false.  It is regrettable that I have yet to hear any of the false allegations being withdrawn by the Deputies in question.  False allegations were made in respect of regional newspapers.  It was suggested that the strategic communications unit leaned on the editors of certain publications in some way to ensure prospective candidates were included in advertorials.  We know from the report that was compiled by Assistant Secretary Canavan and from documents that have been provided by newspaper editors that this was not the case and that these decisions were made by the editors themselves.  Unfortunately, I have yet to hear any of these false allegations being withdrawn by the Deputies who made them.  I would welcome the withdrawal of some of the allegations.  It has also been alleged that the Civil Service code or the public sector standards code may have been breached.  We know from the Canavan report that such breaches did not happen.  Rather than being precious about this - I certainly do not feel like a victim in this regard - I am asking the Deputies who made the false allegations that have been refuted in the Canavan report or in documents released under freedom of information to go back over the various allegations they made and have the decency to withdraw those that were false.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000022#U00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1527683700,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Is the Taoiseach serious?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000022#U00400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1527683700,"counter":320,"content":"<p>We need to move on to Question No. 10.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000022#U00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1527683700,"counter":321,"content":"<p>Will the Taoiseach answer the question I asked?

The Canon Hayes Recreation Centre in Tipperary town is struggling to stay open.  The centre has been a vital part of this, and the wider, community for more than 30 years.  It has been a tremendous community resource and a monumental success for the development of sport and recreation in this area.  The Canon Hayes national sports awards are world renowned.  I compliment the management and staff of the centre on the job they do.<\/p>  <p>  Major challenges now exist to meet overheads, such as insurance, which is in excess of &euro;30,000 per annum, light and heat, which is in excess of &euro;30,000 per annum, and the maintenance costs on a now 30 year old building.  It is worth noting that when the centre was built, the three excellent secondary schools in the town relinquished their entitlement to the provision of duplicate facilities, such as the provision of a main hall or a gym in their schools.<\/p>  <p>  The centre is now struggling and it has applied for several grants, both correctly and very professionally.  It met the Tipperary Leader company and county council officials and was advised to submit a joint application under the county council recreation scheme and the South Tipperary Development Company.  However, the county council let it down.  The proposal was to upgrade the all-weather pitches with a new surface at a cost of &euro;200,000.<\/p><p>The proposal included a new surface and the cost came to &euro;200,000.  A long process ensued to establish how the project could be funded.  It was agreed to look at a co-funding project with South Tipperary Development Company and the community facilities branch of Tipperary County Council.  On the advice of county council officials who were apprised of all the plans, the committee was advised to apply for a grant of &euro;40,000 and a maximum grant of &euro;150,000 from South Tipperary Development Company.  The committee would have had to provide the remaining &euro;10,000, which it had no problem in doing.  However, those involved were completely disheartened to learn that the application for the county council grant was unsuccessful.  The disappointment was exacerbated when they heard the reasons for the refusal.  First, the project was too big, although it was co-funded.  Second, following further questions, they were told that three smaller projects in the county would have to be excluded in order to include the Canon Hayes project.<\/p> <p> These matters are with the county council.  There is an unwillingness to engage in a joint membership proposal involving the centre and the swimming pool which is under local authority management in Tipperary town.  It looks as if the county council has no wish to help or does not want to help.<\/p> <p> The capital grants scheme is under the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross.  The committee was even more disheartened as it had been told to apply and did.  The deprivation index for Tipperary town is relevant.  We all know the reasons for the score.  It is a wonderful town with wonderful spirited people, but they have nothing in the way of employment or supports.  We question the scaling and grading.  The Eircode was used to identify the site and location.  We question why and how the decision was made.  The committee has received no satisfactory answers from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport as to why the proposal scored so badly in the deprivation index.  Clearly, the Pobal deprivation index indicates that the relevant part of the town is severely challenged.  I have no wish to talk down the town; it is a wonderful town with wonderful people.  However, they have got nothing but kicks from successive Governments over the years.  They have received no supports.  There are other excellent community facilities such as the Moorehaven Centre and many other special facilities.  They are organised by people in the true spirit of the late great Canon Hayes.  It is not fair that this project has been denied funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000024#BB00200","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527685200,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I am taking this Topical Issue on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, and the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Brendan Griffin.  Unfortunately, they are unable to be here.  As a former Minister of State in the Department, I have some knowledge of the issue raised by the Deputy.  As someone from a neighbouring constituency, I know the centre to which he is referring.  <\/p><p>The sports capital programme, as operated by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, provides funding for voluntary, sports and community organisations for the provision of sports and recreational facilities.  Over 11,500 projects have benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to close to &euro;1 billion.  The programme has transformed the sports landscape of Ireland, with improvements in the quality and quantity of sports facilities in virtually every village, town and city in the country.  The facilities funded range from the smallest clubs to national centres of sporting excellence.<\/p><p>The most recent round of the programme closed for applications in February last year.  I was the Minister of State who opened it.  By the deadline, a record number of over 2,300 applications had been received.  Originally, it was envisaged that &euro;30 million would be allocated.  That would have made the allocation of grants particularly challenging.  Following discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, we managed to secure significant extra funding for the scheme.  That allowed us to allocate a total of &euro;60 million to 1,807 sports organisations throughout the country.  In the case of County Tipperary alone, a total of 82 projects were allocated funding totalling over &euro;2.1 million.<\/p><p>I will outline how individual allocations were decided.  For the first time, the full assessment process and scoring system for the 2017 round of the sports capital programme was published on the Department's website in advance of the assessment work commencing.  I was the person who insisted that that should happen.  The overall amount available for each county was calculated on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis, with individual allocation amounts primarily decided by the score received at assessment stage based on the published criteria.  Extra marks were awarded for applications that demonstrated how they would increase participation, applications that shared facilities and applications for facilities located in disadvantaged areas.  The Deputy referred to these criteria.  He also referred to disadvantaged area status.  The Pobal deprivation index was used to automatically generate the relevant score based on where the proposed facility was located, as shown by the applicant.<\/p><p>I can inform the House that the Canon Hayes Recreation Centre, of which I am aware, has been allocated a total of over &euro;400,000 under the sports capital programme since 1998.  This includes allocations made in the 2017 round of the programme of &euro;27,500 towards the cost of refurbishment of the tennis court.  As stated, this amount was based on the total amount available for projects in County Tipperary and the score obtained by the application.  While this allocation was less than the amount applied for - a problem in applications throughout the country - officials in the sports capital division of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are always willing to work with relevant organisations for grants, provided that the proposed alternative works fulfil all other terms and conditions of the sports capital programme.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to continuing to invest in sports infrastructure.  In that regard, the national development plan commits to further expanding the sports capital programme in the years ahead.  A full review of the 2017 round of the programme has been finished by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and published on the Department's website.  The review suggests some further improvements that should be considered prior to the next round of the programme opening for applications.  Among the changes being considered are further enhanced weighting for disadvantaged areas and an even greater focus on shared community facilities.  Furthermore, the Department is committed to allowing all applicants to correct errors in applications during the assessment stage.  This will remedy one of the criticisms levied by many people, including me.  I expect an announcement on the timing of the next round to be made in the coming weeks.  I imagine Deputies of all persuasions and none will welcome this.  In that regard, any application for further suitable works at the Canon Hayes Recreation Centre in Tipperary will receive every consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000025#CC00200","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1527685200,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I am not happy with the answer.  The cost of the proposed upgrade of the gymnasium and tennis courts came to in excess of &euro;88,000.  An application for this funding was made to the sports capital section of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The committee looked for 95% funding, which would have meant a grant of approximately &euro;83,000, if successful.  However, the grant allocated for the project was &euro;27,500, which would not allow either part of the project to proceed, whether the upgrade of the tennis court facilities or the gymnasium.  The facilities are in bad condition.  They have been badly neglected and are not being maintained by the county council, although it was supposed to do so.<\/p>  <p>  After detailed investigation, it was discovered that the application had scored zero under the heading of level of disadvantage, although the centre is in a disadvantaged area and had scored 22.74 in the Pobal index.  Who got the figures wrong?  It was not the hard-working committee, the board or the supporters who have paid &euro;100 for tickets in raffles in an effort to keep it going.  The problem is in the Departments involved.  They are not talking together.  We see this a good deal in the Department for which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, is responsible.  Why did he or his officials not talk to Pobal to find out why the proposal had scored zero?  It should have scored 22.74 since it is considered to be very disadvantaged in the Pobal index.  These are the facts, as the Minister of State cannot deny.  There has to be a review.  I am not citing the figure of the Canon Hayes Recreation Centre committee or mine.  They are the figures of Pobal.  It is in a disadvantaged area because of the lack of employment and investment in the town.  It is not fair to leave the committee or the community like this.  The facilities are so well used by so many.  Many good sportspeople have come from the town.  The Canon Hayes sports awards scheme has been running for decades.  The Minister of State needs to go back to the drawing board.  The Department has got it wrong and the Pobal figures are correct.  This will be an issue in many facilities throughout the country, including the county of the Minister of State and elsewhere.  Facilities come of age.  After 30 years they need maintenance and upgrading.  There is no point in announcing a scheme if the Government is unable to keep the investment upgraded to a reasonable standard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000025#CC00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1527685200,"counter":356,"content":"<p>As I pointed out, the centre at the centre of this Topical Issue matter has received over &euro;400,000 in State support under the sports capital programme.  It is not an insignificant amount of money.  The &euro;27,500 received this time around is not insignificant either.  I realise the allocation does not cover the cost of the project as set out, whether for the tennis courts or the gymnasium.  However, if there are other works for which the Canon Hayes Recreation Centre committee wishes to apply that follow the original schedule set out by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for eligible works, departmental officials in Killarney would welcome any opportunity to discuss the matter.  It is not as if the &euro;27,500 will not or cannot be drawn down.

Allocations of &euro;400,000 have been made but those groups can apply again.  I know the centre in question and I encourage Tipperary County Council, the Leader company and the local community to go back to the Department to ensure that every point can be achieved in the application.  I know the officials in the Department in Killarney and have worked with most of them.  They are very good people and are open to an engagement with any sporting organisations which has difficulties to see how they can boost their points.  It is often a matter of the presentation of the application.  The Deputy has to appreciate, also, that when thousands of applications are received from across the country, officials can only act based on the documentation and information submitted.  That said, I have referred specific cases from my constituency, which is across the Galtees from that of the Deputy's, to the Department and the people involved, whether in the GAA or other sporting organisations, always found the Department's officials to be open and accommodating in ensuring the best possible allocation can be made the next time.<\/p> <p> I am aware that the Minister, Deputy Ross, is anxious to hear directly about the specific case raised by Deputy Mattie McGrath because he and the Deputy are great friends.

There is an obligation on the Government to get the best possible value for taxpayers' money.  However, a number of issues are arising on foot of the manner in which the State's procurement process is being implemented.  Ireland has a small, open economy and has vulnerabilities other EU countries do not share.  The size and scale of the economy is putting Irish contractors at a distinct disadvantage.  The fact that the low threshold for all State contracts is &euro;135,000 means virtually everything a State controlled body does falls into the public procurement system.  The local Irish supplier of goods and services who is not, in general, on the same scale as multinational companies is loaded with the huge costs of preparing a tender.  In some cases, it can take a staff of dozens to fulfil the obligations of the tender process.<\/p><p>I turn to the example of a supplier of fruit and vegetables to the Garda College who had been supplying the college for decades but had his application turned down on the basis that he had no written plan in place as to how he could continue to trade in the event of major flooding or storms.  Does that make the Minister of State feel comfortable about the process?  I can given him numerous other examples where bureaucracy has superseded common sense.  Local businesses, whether small, medium or large, are being frozen out of the system.  We are losing jobs in Tipperary because of it and I am sure it is the same right around the country.  The only avenue left open to local businesses is to act as subcontractors to the companies which are awarded the main tenders.  It is at this point that local companies find themselves cornered and disadvantaged.  Another company in Tipperary was subcontracted into a State-contracted construction project.  The main contractor had one employee on site while the local subcontractor had 12.  The local company was carrying all the responsibility for employment contracts and health and safety but was not benefitting from ownership of the main contract.  In fact, the main contractor could not complete the contract, went into liquidation and left the local company with a huge outstanding debt.<\/p><p>The Minister of State must agree that it is unacceptable to put Irish companies at risk like this.  Surely, something must change.  In another example, block-layers and plasterers were subcontracted into another local authority construction project.  Within weeks, the main contractor went into liquidation leaving the block-layers and plasterers with no payment for work done.  I checked with the local authority and found that it had paid the main contractor &euro;400,000 and was happy that its engineers had confirmed that &euro;400,000 worth of work had been completed.  The local authority had no legal option other than to pay the money to the main contractor while the subcontractors had funded the &euro;400,000 worth of work.  This is hard evidence that the current rules are not working.  They allow multinational companies to tender for work with competitive pricing on the backs of local companies.  We are losing jobs because of this and it is, ultimately, costing the State a fortune.  Any analysis will surely show that there is little gain on one side of the balance sheet while we are losing a fortune on the other.  The <i>status quo<\/i>is not an option.  There must be some protection for local Irish companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000026#DD00600","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1527685800,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I have a solicitor's letter regarding a company which presented in the High Court with a petition for examinership on 16 January.

Having grown up in a household which depended for its income on construction, I have told him frankly that the activity to which he refers is intolerable.  Deputy Cahill has raised another couple of issues relating to procurement of goods and services in general and I can address those separately and in summing up.  He makes a number of points to which I want to reply.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, these are not new developments, nor, as the Deputies said, are they confined to State contracts.  Deputies Scanlon and Cahill have raised cases and I will gladly take the details from them when I leave the Chamber.  The cases cited stem from a failure on the part of a main contractor to pay for work that has been carried out by a subcontractor.  Former Senator Feargal Quinn's Construction Contracts Act was developed in consultation with industry to address these poor payment practices.  The Bill was introduced in the Seanad in 2010 when the late Brian Lenihan was Minister for Finance.  His Department spearheaded the Bill and it received cross-party support in both Houses.  It was enacted in 2013 and applies to all construction contracts that were entered into after 25 July 2016.  That small and medium enterprises are still not in receipt of payments due on construction projects was unacceptable then and it remains so today.  It is all the more galling when it arises on a public works contract as it is the State that pays the main contractor what money is due.  The State always pays when the money is due.<\/p>  <p>  The conditions of most construction contracts in use between construction clients and building contractors in both the public and private sectors require that payments be made at defined intervals, which is to say in staged payments, and that payment is contingent on work being completed to a predetermined standard.  Once that payment is made to the main contractor, there is an expectation that it will, in turn, pay its subcontractors.  This is set out also in contract law and is not something unique to this situation.  Usually, there is no contractual obligation in this regard in the contract between the construction client and the main contractor because the matter is left to the commercial arrangements between the supply chain members.  This point was raised at the time of the debate, namely, that there is a commercial relationship between each of the principal and subcontractors down the line.  That is where the problem arises.  The issues identified by former Senator Quinn during the development of the construction contracts legislation highlighted an absence of formal contracts in many cases along with sharp payment practices by some, even where a formal contract did exist.  The Deputies have raised this again today.<\/p><p>Now enacted, the Construction Contracts Act 2013 imposes payment regulations on all construction contracts, public or private, whether they be written, oral or otherwise, and provides the tools necessary to enforce payment.  These include a maximum payment interval of 30 days and a requirement to honour payment requests within 30 days for subcontractors, a right to suspension for non-payment and a right to refer a payment dispute to adjudication.  The legislation also outlaws the practice of pay-when-paid provisions which were prevalent in most forms of subcontract.<\/p> <p> Whilst much of the interest from industry surrounding the Act was centred on the introduction of adjudication, it is the discipline that the legislation imposes on payments that would appear to be have been largely ignored - this is the point that the two Deputies have made so comprehensively.  Arguably, these are the most important provisions in the Act but they require the subcontractor to enforce their entitlements with the contractor pro-actively in the manner prescribed in the legislation, which enjoyed all-party support at the time, for payments that are due.<\/p> <p> The Act does not cut across the normal rules for company liquidation or receivership to which Deputy Cahill referred and where this arises there is no avenue for recovery.  This point is laid out in law as well.  However, the magnitude of the exposure that many subcontractors and their families currently face upon the insolvency of a contractor would not arise if the provision for payments were insisted upon and the remedies available were exercised where payment is not forthcoming.  I understand the reasons and I am not averse to it because I grew up in a house that was directly affected by this kind of carry on.<\/p> <p> The issues raised by the Deputies would suggest that subcontractors are not exercising the rights provided for in the Act.  There may be a reason for that.  To be quite honest about it, I can understand why that is so.  While I appreciate a certain reticence to engage in the manner prescribed in the Act for fear of risking business relationships, subcontractors need to question whether it is worthwhile doing business.<\/p> <p> In relation-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000026#DD00800","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527686400,"counter":366,"content":"<p>The Minister of State will have to use his other two minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000027#EE00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1527686400,"counter":367,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has recognised that there is a problem.

We must put a level playing field in place so that local contractors themselves can win the contracts rather than going in as subcontractors where they have no rights.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Scanlon referred to unsecured creditors getting 1.75% of what they were owed when a company went into voluntary examinership.  I will not name here the company that did it locally in my constituency but in the middle of January, it went into voluntary examinership.  On 24 April, the company came back out of voluntary examinership and then traded away as normal again.  Unfortunately, the company's local subcontractors only got paid 1.75% of what they were owned.  No local businesses can carry that kind of a burden where a man who is owed &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 only gets paid a fraction of that.  This has to change.  The legislation has to change.

We talked about procurement not working and then about the construction issue.  In fact, procurement is working.  Some &euro;12 billion is spent by the State in Ireland on an annual basis.  Over 90% of it is spent with Irish companies and of that over 50% is spent in the small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, sector.  I chair the SME leadership group within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are constantly looking for Deputies who have particular issues to bring them forward to myself and I will discuss them with the Office of Government Procurement.  The Office of Government Procurement is constantly looking at ways in which we can improve matters.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the points the Deputies raise on unacceptable behaviour in construction, which is a separate issue because it comes in under the construction contracts element of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and a complicating factor of which is that the covering legislation, Construction Contracts Act 2013, that former Senator Feargal Quinn brought in and that was then adopted by the D&aacute;il, is now with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  As a state or as a contracting authority, our contract is with the principal contractor.  The law of the land states that we are required to pay when a certain stage is met, and we do that.  We live up to our side of it.  If there are contractors who are not living up to their side of it, there is a problem.  That is why the enabling legislation was enacted and that is why I encourage people to familiarise themselves with it.<\/p>  <p>  I can understand this issue will come to a head with the &euro;116 billion the State is about to spend under Project Ireland 2040, part of which we announced today.  While we do not want to have the same fields of white elephants roaming around the country as roamed around under a previous national development plan, we want to make sure that we get value for money but at the same time that people are properly looked after.<\/p>  <p>  I will take the points the Deputies raised in relation to specific companies - it would not be appropriate to raise them in the House - and have a look at them with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.

I have met some of the parents, I have met the children and I have met the teaching staff there.  One could not meet a more dedicated, hardworking and nicer bunch of people.<\/p>  <p>  However, the conditions in which they are delivering services are unacceptable.  As the sun is shining - I am not here to give out about the sunshine - it gets uncomfortably warm within the school.  The good news is at least they can go outside.

The Department is committed to providing a permanent accommodation solution, and in that regard a project to deliver a new school building for St. Michael&rsquo;s House special school on a greenfield site has been included the Department&rsquo;s six-year capital programme.  It is planned to provide a new school building for St. Michael&rsquo;s special school to accommodate a 14 classroom school, expandable to 16 classrooms, to include classes for pupils with mild general learning difficulties, autism spectrum disorder, multiple disabilities and severe and profound disabilities.  The Department is working closely with Fingal County Council in accordance with the memorandum of understanding on the identification and acquisition of a suitable site to facilitate the school building project.<\/p> <p> The site acquisition process for this school has been ongoing for some time.  Initial efforts were focused on acquiring land in the vicinity of the school&rsquo;s current location which was preferred by the school authorities.  Efforts in that regard were unsuccessful and subsequently the current site option was identified.  The acquisition process was paused for some time while the Department engaged with the school authorities regarding potential alternative accommodation which was available at the time.  Based on the outcome of this engagement, the site acquisition process recently restarted and negotiations with the relevant landowner are at an advanced stage.  I confirm that a potential permanent site option has been identified and is being progressed.<\/p> <p> The Department, with the assistance of Fingal County Council, is engaging with the landowner.  Department officials are working to clarify some technical issues on the development of the site and this assessment process is expected to be completed in approximately two weeks, assuming no issues arise.  Once these technical queries have been clarified, agreement on the terms of the site acquisition can be finalised and it is anticipated that the conveyancing process can then be advanced by the respective solicitors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000027#EE00800","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527687000,"counter":375,"content":"<p>That is not all negative-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000028#FF00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1527687000,"counter":376,"content":"<p>It is pretty positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000028#FF00300","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1527687000,"counter":377,"content":"<p>-----but it is not a date.

Lisdoonvarna is a very famous town in County Clare.  The school has had to take in 18 extra pupils over the past three months because a direct provision centre opened in Lisdoonvarna at the beginning of March and now has 115 asylum seekers, 18 of which are schoolgoing children attending the primary school.  The sudden influx of pupils has put substantial pressure on the resources of the school and its ability to deliver education to the highest standards.<\/p>  <p>  It was a controversial decision to place the direct provision centre in Lisdoonvarna.  The school openly embraced taking in the 18 children.  The school was quite enthusiastic about bringing them in and assimilating them into the community.  The school expected that it would be allocated extra resources.  The real pressures that were going to come from the direct provision centre were on educational services and health services.  The school expected that extra supports would be put in place and it enthusiastically embraced the students.  The school expected it would get an additional teacher.  It is looking for an additional language teacher and an additional classroom teacher because the number of pupils in the school has risen by 13% in a very short time.<\/p>  <p>  The students, being asylum seekers, have language difficulties and educational difficulties.  The school is in a very vulnerable position.  The pupil-teacher ratio has increased and the extra 18 pupils have exceptional needs.  In the future there may be more than 18 pupils because the nature of asylum seekers is that they are transient.  The number of such students attending the primary school may increase beyond 18.  The existing pupils in the school prior to the arrival of the asylum seekers had a standard of education that was very high, but that will invariably be diluted unless new resources and extra teachers are put in place to accommodate their needs.<\/p>  <p>  The school is looking for a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio because of the extraordinary and unique circumstances of having such an increase in numbers and asylum seekers who require greater time and attention from the teachers.  The school is not looking for DEIS status but for a DEIS-type ratio for the school.  The problem is that Lisdoonvarna is being treated as just an ordinary national school that has had an increase in pupils.  It is in an extraordinary position in that the increase in pupils comprises asylum seekers and they have exceptional needs.  I understand the Department has allocated a half-time equivalent language teacher to the school and that is very welcome.  The school requires an additional classroom teacher to accommodate the extra numbers.<\/p>  <p>  Lisdoonvarna should be seen as a template for the future in situations like this because direct provision centres may be opened in other towns like Lisdoonvarna.  There should be an anticipation of the needs rather than the needs being arrived at first.  It should be anticipatory rather than a crisis situation.  Lisdoonvarna could be used as a template for other schools and as a beacon for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000028#FF00700","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1527687600,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton.

The contract is for the provision of services for a maximum of 115 persons and for a fixed period of one year.  The provision of accommodation services beyond that date will be subject to a new process and the contract will not be renewed automatically.  To date, the Reception and Integration Agency has dispersed 107 asylum seekers to Lisdoonvarna on a phased basis, 36 under the age of 18 years.<\/p><p>The direct provision centre in Lisdoonvarna is one of a number opened by the Reception and Integration Agency across the country in recent years.  The Department of Education and Skills has seconded an official to the agency to support the education aspects arising from accommodating asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation.  Owing to the <i>ad hoc<\/i>nature of requests for asylum to the agency, it is not possible for the Department to be advised significantly in advance of the fact that a centre is being opened or details of the numbers of children and adults or their ages.<\/p><p>The education issues which arise for local schools and education and training boards relate to capacity in terms of the numbers and age profiles of children and to the English language competency of the adults.  The impact of the opening of a direct provision centre on local schools, therefore, needs to be considered on a case by case basis.  When the relevant information is available from the Reception and Integration Agency, the Department works with local schools, the education and training board and Tusla on education provision for residents of the proposed centre.  St. Enda&rsquo;s national school, Lisdoonvarna has enrolled ten pupils who are resident in the direct provision centre in Lisdoonvarna and indicated that it will enrol a further eight in September.

It comes in the week when we expect to hear that the number of people, including children, who were homeless last month is likely to be close to 10,000.  I expect the Minister to publish the figures this week because last month they were published on the 30th day of the month, even though in the previous month they had been published a little earlier.  As a large proportion of the number will be children, we now live in a country with thousands of children in homeless services.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also comes on the day when four organisations that work at the coalface, Barnardos, Focus Ireland, Simon Communities and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, highlight the hidden homeless who are living with relatives, without autonomy, adequate space or security.

It comes a week after the review of rent predictability measures.  The rent pressure zone legislation was put on the Department's website but I do not believe there was any accompanying press statement.  It is quite limited in its proposals and I will return to it later when dealing with the issues facing tenants.  I understand the Minister intends to bring forward legislation, which he indicated again this morning, in June to amend the residential tenancy legislation.  I would urge that it be more ambitious and comprehensive than what seems to be indicated in what I read on the Department's website, which was quite limited and did not address some of the issues that were to be addressed in that review.  I look forward to the Minister's response in that regard.<\/p> <p> The fact is that fear and insecurity are rife among our fellow citizens who are renters, whether through choice or necessity.  Most people who are being made homeless end up that way because their rents have been hiked up or they have been put out of their privately rented accommodation because their landlords have said that the home is needed for a family member, that the place has to be done up or that it is being sold.<\/p> <p> The main purpose of this Bill is to address the real and distressing circumstances in which people find themselves.  It is urgent that there are the kinds of protections that are the norm in other European countries.  Many of us know people living in Germany, France and other European countries where there is a substantial suite of measures that protect renters and allow them to make a long-term home in rented accommodation.  It is quite the norm in many other countries but we are not in that space.  We have many accidental landlords and much insecurity.  I would be particularly concerned about older people who are living in rented accommodation and who are very worried about their futures.  I have met some representatives of older people and that is a particular worry now with which we should concern ourselves.  I am also very concerned about children.<\/p> <p> I published the Housing (Homeless Families) Bill on behalf of the Labour Party, and it was accepted in this House.  It is designed specifically to consider the needs of children who are in homelessness and where they are simply described in the legislation as dependants of adults who are homeless rather than having the kind of rights children need in their own right.  For example, they need to have play space, to be near their friends, to have places to eat, places to do their homework and all of those activities that are so important for children.  They need to be specifically catered for by the housing authorities and by the State.<\/p> <p> The anxiety and misery endured by families and especially children needs to end.  We have had many debates on housing and we all know that more supply of housing for people at all levels of income is crucial.  That goes without saying.  We particularly need more social and affordable housing.  During Taoiseach's questions today I raised with him again the need to use the 700 or so publicly owned sites for social and affordable housing rather than for private profit.  I was disappointed when he talked about the social mix and that he indicated the private was very much part of it.  If affordable purchase is part of it, that housing will be private too and they will be people with jobs and incomes.  I do not accept the level at which local authorities now appear to want to involve the private sector in publicly owned sites.<\/p> <p> While we wait for this supply to ramp up, the private rented market will be the only space available for so many families with different needs and, in most cases, limited income.  It must be made a safer, more secure space for those people.<\/p> <p> The Constitution contains property rights but they are supposed to be balanced with social rights and the needs of the common good.  I strongly urge that, in the homelessness crisis, the common good needs to be served by giving people the kind of certainty and security their counterparts in the rental sectors in most European countries have.  This needs to happen in a comprehensive way.  The drip feed of change that has happened so far does no service to tenants or landlords.<\/p> <p> An example of an area that is outside the rent pressure zones is my city of Limerick.  There is constant speculation that Limerick may be included in the rent pressure zone the next time around, and the Minister's predecessor suggested that when he was in Limerick some time ago, but it has not been included yet.  It is an incentive for landlords to put up the rent in advance of the possible inclusion of an area in the rent pressure zones.  The drip feed is not helpful and the proposal in our legislation that would include the whole country as a rent pressure zone would eliminate that problem.<\/p> <p> The Labour Party is presenting this Bill as a comprehensive measure to provide security of tenure and rent certainty to tenants.  It is designed to protect people from losing their homes in the context of soaring figures relating to homelessness.  I welcome the indications of support we have received from other parties and Members and the fact that the Government has indicated it will not oppose the Bill.  We know that a large number of Bills have been sent to the Select Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for Committee Stage, including the Housing (Homeless Families) Bill, but what we all want to achieve is the implementation of the measures we have been proposing.  What I and the Labour Party want to achieve is the implementation of the measures contained in this Bill without delay.  I ask the Minister to consider incorporating them into his Bill which is due to be published quite soon, and he might clarify that.<\/p> <p> Before I go through the detail of the Bill, I want to cite a few of the many individual stories we have heard, which make a huge impression in terms of  the reality of people's lives.  This morning when the groups, Barnardos, Focus Ireland, Simon Communities and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, got together, they gave a number of examples of people who are in hidden homelessness.  I want to quote from two people who are in hidden homelessness because they lost their private rented accommodation.  One of them is Jenny and her Mam.  I will not read their story in full but this will give an understanding of their circumstances.  Jenny is seven years old.  She shares a single bed with her Mam in a small room in a house share.  All of Jenny's clothes and toys fit into two drawers under the bed.  There is a TV in their room and a fridge for some food and snacks.  Jenny is the only child who lives in the house.  The other grown-ups who live there stay up late each night playing loud music and sometimes shouting.  There are often visitors coming and going until after midnight.  Jenny makes up excuses whenever her friends ask can they visit her house.  She has not told any of them that she shares a bed with her Mam or that she eats her dinner on the bed every night.<\/p> <p> Jenny can still remember when she and her Mam had a home of their own.  It was a nice apartment with a bright kitchen where Jenny used to eat breakfast every day.  They had to move out of the apartment as the building was being refurbished.  Rents in their town had increased so much that all Jenny's Mam could afford was a single room in a house share.  Her Mam said it would only be for a little while, but Jenny has had two birthdays since they moved in.  That is an example of two people who had to move out of their home because they were told the accommodation was being refurbished.  That is one of the measures we address in our Bill.<\/p> <p> The other example from which I want to quote is the story of Laura, Noel. Barry and Sam.  Laura, Noel and their two sons, Barry and Sam, aged eight and five, became homeless when their landlord decided to sell the property they had been renting for the previous eight years.  They frantically looked for alternative accommodation, but there were hundreds of people eager to take the few places that were available to rent.  The family have been on the housing list for nine years but they have had no offer of a house in that time.  Once their eviction date came, faced with moving the family into emergency accommodation, Laura and her husband, Noel, decided instead to split the family up.  Laura and the boys moved in with Laura's parents and Noel moved in with a friend.  Their dog, Blondie, was sent to live with a relative in another county.  Over a year later the family still do not have a home of their own and continue to live separately.<\/p> <p> I will give an example from my constituency of a person I know quite well whom I will call Catherine, even though that is not her name.  Even though she is living in one of the suburbs of Limerick that has very high rents, she does not qualify to be in a rent pressure zone.  This is one of the areas the Minister needs to address.  Rent pressure zones take in entire local electoral areas, and the local electoral area in this case contains rural as well as urban areas.  The rents are much lower in the rural areas, so that does not help the people who live in the suburban areas.<\/p> <p> Catherine is working.  She is separated with two children.  She was given a huge rent hike that she was not expecting which she simply could not afford.  She tried everywhere to get something affordable and in the end had to move far outside the city, far away from her job and from the children's school, which was the only option she had having tried whatever she could to get appropriate accommodation.<\/p><p>This is an example of the problems for a city such as Limerick that is not included in the rent pressure zones.  I urge the Minister to look at that particular measure.  It was to be covered in the review but I did not see anything in the documentation I have that would indicate that this is being done.<br\/><br\/>In the time I have left I will go through some of the detail of different sections of the Bill.  I will not go through them in chronological order but I will address the different themes.<br\/><br\/>On rent certainty we propose, as have many other Members in the House, that rent should be linked to the increase in the cost of living and it should not go any higher than the consumer price index.  We also propose that the rent pressure zone should apply to the whole State.  Not only are cities, such as Limerick, in trouble in this context, it also affects peripheral areas just outside existing rent pressure zones.<br\/><br\/>We propose a number of measures on security of tenure, one of which is that the sale of the property should not be allowed as grounds for the termination of a tenancy.  The fact that a landlord is selling the property should not give him or her the right to evict the tenants.  The National Economic and Social Council in its report on the rental sector in Ireland said:<\/p><blockquote>Removing sale as a reason for ending a lease would significantly improve secure occupancy and the Council recommends that this be adopted for Ireland.  One view is that this could reduce the price that those selling rental properties could achieve, compared to the price with vacant procession.  On the other hand, the more the Irish rental system is driven by long\u2010term yield, rather than changing asset prices, the higher the value purchasers will put on properties with an existing, secure rental stream.<\/blockquote><p>There are two sides to that argument.  Refurbishment would need to be substantial before a person should be asked to move.  This was one of the examples that I quoted.<br\/><br\/>Where it is claimed that the property is to be used for a family member, we propose that this reason should not be as wide as it is, such as, for example, when a niece or a nephew can be said to need the property.  We want to tighten this up to the immediate family such as spouse, partner, children or stepchildren.<br\/><br\/>We want to see longer Part 4 tenancies.  Deposits should be no more than one month's rent.  We are aware of landlords who ask for two or three month's rent.  We also want to see the deposit protection scheme come in within six months.  This is already provided for in legislation; I published it when I was in that role.  The previous rent information should also be available to new tenants, so they know what the rent was and they know if it has been raised illegally.<br\/><br\/>We propose that receivers have the same duties as landlords.  Many people are in tenancies under a receiver and they do not have the rights that other tenants have, such as to have the property maintained and so on.<br\/><br\/>This is a summary of the Bill.  I very much welcome the support that has already been indicated.  These are practical measures to protect renters.  I understand the Government will not oppose the Bill but I really want to see these measures implemented to protect the people who, more and more, are in really precarious situations in the private rented market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000029#GG00500","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527688800,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Despite the best efforts of the Government, landlords continue to dance around, or through, attempts at increasing security of tenure for renters.  We believe that if enacted, and not just accepted, this Bill would be a real tenants' Bill.  The measures in the Bill provide real protections for tenants, as outlined by Deputy O'Sullivan.<\/p>  <p>  The housing crisis is not abating and I am concerned that there has been a definite shift by the Government towards the private rental sector and the private market as a means of solving this crisis.  We need a State-led approach that focuses on building not on leasing.  The focus should minimise any need to enter the private market to buy homes and in doing so competing with regular people, which I know is happening also.<\/p>  <p>  While many renters find themselves at the coal face of this crisis, we need to put in place further emergency measures as exist in this Bill to protect them.  When one is on the front line of the housing crisis dealing with people day in, day out, as many Members do, it never ceases to amaze the measures landlords undertake to end good tenancies for the goal of increased profit.<\/p>  <p>  The problem is that the attempt to start building local authority housing in 2014 and 2015 as part of a real State-led approach to the housing crisis was halted and the focus has shifted too greatly towards the housing assistance payment, HAP and to the landlord-led solution.  This compounds the housing crisis and keeps people in bed and breakfast accommodation and in family hubs.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister tell the House why Fingal County Council housing projects that began the planning process in 2015 still do not have a shovel in the ground?  Some have been finished, but it took three years to build nine houses in Balrothery, County Dublin, which the Minister of State, Deputy English, recently officially opened.  It is four years since construction started on 70 houses in Lusk.  Meanwhile, projects in Swords and Balbriggan that began in 2014 and 2015 have made had no progress at all.  In the past two years, there has been next to no council house developments going to planning.   It seems there is an ideological shift back to the solution of Part V properties and private rental accommodation from landlords.  I put it to the Minister that this is not good enough.  <\/p>  <p>  Some landlords are running rings around the regulations.  Fingal, for example, is in the rent pressure zone but many tenants are not aware of this and they engage in new rental agreements over and above the 4% limits, petrified that if they do not they will end up in a hotel or in bed and breakfast accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Our Bill calls for the entire State to be designated a rent pressure zone for a period of three years.  This needs to be hammered home.  I have had a case in Fingal in which a landlord gave notice to tenants that they had to leave as the house needed to be remediated for pyrite.  One of the tenants accepted the notice and moved out.  Within a week, there was a new tenant in place, no doubt paying a higher rent, and no pyrite remediation works had started because the house did not have a pyrite problem.  This is the kind of stuff that is going on.  The landlord lied.  He got his tenants out and is, no doubt, reaping financial benefit from this unscrupulous decision.<\/p>  <p>  There are many complex effects of the housing crisis.  I have written to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and I have pursued the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection about a case in which a person on invalidity pension had the household benefits package removed because she took her grown up son and family back into the family home due to them being made homeless.  This person and her husband are doing the State a great service by providing short-term secure accommodation to their son and his family, which is what people are directed to do; stay with family and friends.  They are saved from being a burden on the State and another homeless statistic.  It seems somewhat cruel that they have their household benefits package removed as a result of this.<\/p>  <p>  It would be a very simple solution, with a meagre cost to the State, if the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection allowed a 12 month grace period for people to keep their secondary benefits should they take in a direct family member who has been made homeless.  If the person can provide a validated termination notice and a statutory declaration from the landlord, which all tenants are required to have as part of the termination notice,  this should satisfy the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection without impacting on administrative resources.<\/p>  <p>  I note that the Government is not opposing this Bill but what does this actually mean?  I believe this is a political manoeuvre, performed on a regular basis, to avoid the Government getting a bad headline on a Wednesday or Thursday morning.  There appears to be no appetite to move these Bills forward.  By accepting it, the Government looks like noble practitioners of new politics but in reality it is merely allowing Bills to enter a metaphorical room from which they will never emerge and move on.<\/p>  <p>  This is new politics but it is not good politics.  As he is not opposing the Bill, I ask the Minister to either move it along swiftly through the legislative process or bring forward his own Bill which incorporates its contents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000031#JJ00200","speaker":"1301"},{"type":"speech","time":1527688800,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for tabling this Bill.  I assure Deputy Ryan that if I was trying to chase good headlines I would be on a fool's errand.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will not oppose the Bill and I will now outline the reasons we will not oppose it, and which measures we can support in legislation that we have already signalled as forthcoming.  This week in the House there are two Private Members' Bills on the rental sector; one on student accommodation and one on the private rental sector.  I welcome both Bills and I welcome the opportunity to discuss Ireland's rental accommodation market.<\/p>  <p>  In response to points raised by Deputies Jan O'Sullivan and Brendan Ryan, I have just been informed that the April homeless report is now completed and I will endeavour to get the report out as soon as possible today.  It means I will not be able to stay for the remainder of the debate.  I apologise to Deputies that I will not be in the Chamber to hear their contributions to the debate.  It is, however, in the interests of getting the report out today, which is the 30th of the month.  I do not want to delay the report.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to the issue of turnkey projects.  Sometimes when we debate the issues around housing delivery, it can become somewhat academic.  I have no problem with that because I like to get into the detail of these things; I like to understand the numbers and what is behind the numbers.  When we start to no longer serve a useful purpose in those discussions, this is where we start to confuse the public.  Where we become so focused on an academic point we may move away from a substantive point of view.  This is a risk when we start to speak about the delivery of social housing in the State not being what it was 30, 40 or 50 years ago.  We now use a number of different and new streams to make sure that social housing homes are built.  The word \"turnkey\" gives the impression that we are buying a set of keys and moving into a house that is already built.<\/p><p>It actually means taking nothing and building something.  It is the entire process of a project.  Many approvals that cross my desk relate to lands that have not yet been built on.  Only with local authorities putting money behind them are they built on, with the homes going to people on the social housing list.  They are new social housing builds for local authorities and expanding the market, as opposed to trying to bite into a smaller market.  They are an important part of the supply.  Often, such projects can be undertaken more quickly than would be the case in using other channels.<\/p> <p> I do not doubt Deputy Brendan Ryan's concerns about the issues he faces, given that he raises them with me regularly, but I may have detected an attempt to intimate an ideological shift between the time the Labour Party left the housing portfolio and the Fine Gael-led Government took it up and turned the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government into the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, with a dedicated Minister and a &euro;6 billion fund to dramatically increase the social housing stock.  In the last two years of Rebuilding Ireland there will be a sevenfold increase in the number of new social housing units built by local authorities and housing bodies.  The reverse of what the Deputy has sought to intimate is the case.  We have dramatically increased the number of new social housing units being built.  We have had to rely on the housing assistance payment, HAP, and other methods because the stock is not available, but the last two years of Rebuilding Ireland which the Government introduced will see more people accommodated in new social housing than HAP tenancies.<\/p> <p> Deputy Jan O'Sullivan referred to the rent pressure zone review.  The document was published and sent to the members of the Oireachtas joint committee ahead of my appearance before it last week or the week before.  We had an opportunity to debate it then.<\/p> <p> The Bill deals with further protections in the rental sector.  When discussing that sector, it is important that renters of every age and circumstance have viable choices.  Accommodation must be affordable, safe and secure, that is, the tenancy must have a degree of certainty.  Of course, some like the flexibility renting brings.  I enjoyed it while I was a renter.<\/p> <p> This country does not have a mature rental market and the crash left us with a number of accidental landlords, something we are working through.  Some 70% of landlords own just one property, while 86% own two or less.  That is not a mature rental sector by any means.  We must try to improve it, but developing a European-style rental sector during a severe housing shortage will be a challenge.  I know what \"European-style\" means because I rented for 12 years.  I lived in student accommodation and student halls in London, shared a flat in Geneva and had my own apartment in Vienna.  I have also rented in Ireland.  I have seen the difference in security and opportunities for a renter.<\/p> <p> It is important to recognise that we cannot force anyone to be a landlord.  The State is landlord to many tenants and we have responsibilities in that regard.  We can incentivise more landlords through, for example, taxation measures which we have pursued previously and should do again and regulation.  I hope the build-to-rent guidelines that I published last year and which were approved at the beginning of this year will incentivise the building of more rental properties in a mature rental sector.  The guidelines have worked in the provision of student accommodation.  That is why thousands of new student bed places are being built.  We expect the same to happen in the rental sector.  Any new stock of rental accommodation would be beneficial.<\/p> <p> We need larger and more professional landlords.  We must recognise that the international players that are doing this work successfully in other countries and starting to do it successfully in Ireland are a necessary part of the solution if we are to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, which gave us today's situation where we have small landlords leaving the market because they are encumbered with debts that they should never have taken on, the sector is no longer an attractive place for them or the purpose for which they originally bought the units, for example, a child going to college, has come to fruition.  We need larger landlords who will build to rent and bring rental accommodation to the market at scale.<\/p> <p> The issue of student accommodation was debated yesterday.  The Ministers of State, Deputies Damien English and Mary Mitchell O'Connor, are taking the lead where the provision of student accommodation is concerned.  We want to introduce fair rents for students, but it must be done in the right way.  We can do it.  I received an email, one that I only just saw before coming into the Chamber, from Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin suggesting he, Deputy Darragh O'Brien and I sit down to determine the best way of achieving it in legislation.  We can achieve price control without having to introduce types of regulation and protection that are not necessary for student accommodation.  Under such licence agreements which are often negotiated with universities, different protections are necessary for the business model and work fine for students.<\/p> <p> The Government has introduced a number of measures to protect renters.  Rent pressure zones are working.  Rent inflation in Dublin last year was down 3% on the figure for the previous year.  In the fourth quarter of last year there was an increase of 1.1%.  This shows that the rent pressure zones are having an impact.  We have new rental accommodation standards and new protections for tenants where multi-units are sold.  We have a one-stop-shop in the Residential Tenancies Board to improve access for renters and landlords.  We have broadened and strengthened the role of the board and are enforcing its determination orders in the District Court, rather than the Circuit Court, which is quicker and cheaper to do.<\/p> <p> At the national ploughing championships last September I outlined my ambition for a two-year change management programme to make the Residential Tenancies Board a proper, independent regulator for the sector that would robustly defend the interests of both landlords and tenants.  That begins with the residential tenancies Bill, the heads of which the Government approved last month.  When enacted, the legislation will make it an offence to contravene the rent pressure zones, allow the Residential Tenancies Board to investigate and enforce independently the implementation of rent pressure zones and other measures, give greater security of tenure by extending notice to quit periods, in many instances, almost doubling them, and provide for rent transparency, which is welcomed by all sides of the House.  The Bill will be published shortly.  It was meant to happen this week, but there has been a slight delay.  I hope it can be enacted before the summer recess, but it depends on how quickly we can get it through the Houses.  That should not be difficult, given that its measures are supported, but if amendments to the Bill might be better suited to a second Bill that will be before us later in the year, I would prefer that option to be taken in order that the first Bill, on which there is broad agreement, can be passed by the Oireachtas before the summer recess.  The second Bill will deal with more complex issues and need more time to be walked through by the House.<\/p> <p> We will not oppose the Bill before the House.  I will go through my notes briefly, as I am caught for time.  <\/p> <p> We support the publication of rents payable to ensure rent transparency.  We support the proposal on a deposit not exceeding one month's rent.  There is no evidence of a major problem in that regard, but we are working with the Residential Tenancies Board to re-examine the 2015 legislative provisions that have not yet been commenced, as they may need improvements.  It is important that, when we enact the Bill, we do so without placing an additional cost on the tenant and landlord.<\/p> <p> Last year we introduced a definition of what constituted grounds for a termination by a landlord in respect of substantial renovations or refurbishments.  I do not oppose bringing it into law, but we might do so in the second Bill later this year.  <\/p> <p> On tenancies of indefinite duration, extending a Part 4 tenancy from four years to six has happened, but we need to go further.  <\/p> <p> The definition of \"landlord\" is critical, as it ensures a tenant has protection where a receiver has taken over the property.  If the Deputies have ever spoken to someone in such a situation, they will know how stressful it is.  We must address this issue.  An interdepartmental working group is examining the matter and will finalise a report on it.  When I receive that report, I hope to progress it and include it in the second Bill.<\/p> <p> My apologies for rushing, but I find a number of elements of the Bill difficult to support, for example, changing the definition of a family member.  If a property owner's father or grandfather becomes ill, the owner should have the right to let that person into the property without any charge and to serve a notice to quit, bearing in mind all of the relevant legal processes once the notice is served.<\/p> <p> On aligning rent pressure zones with the consumer price index, we cannot force anyone to be a landlord and there must be a reasonable return to cover the annual costs he or she incurs in maintaining the property.  There must also be a reward for the risks he or she takes.  It does not look like landlords take risks in the current market, but consider what happened after the crash when many people were caught.  If we want there to be stable investment in the market, the return needs to be linked with something stable.  A 4% increase is not excessive and is a Steady Eddie.  I see no need to go beyond it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000031#JJ00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527689400,"counter":391,"content":"<p>The Minister's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000032#KK00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1527689400,"counter":392,"content":"<p>This is not about being pro-landlord; rather, it is about being pro-investment and pro-stability in the rental sector.<\/p><p>I beg the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's indulgence for a few moments.

I will do my best not to eat into their time.  I welcome the Bill that Deputy Jan O'Sullivan has brought forward, the Bill we debated yesterday on student rents, and the Bill that Fianna F&aacute;il published a couple of weeks ago in this regard.  I know the Minister has to leave for the April report on homeless figures, which is important.  There is one thing which we will discuss.  Larger, institutional landlords do not necessarily mean longer leases.  I agree that we need another mix within the market.  That can happen.  I have seen it work in other countries because pension funds are investing and want longer-term steady yields.  Some of the investors coming into this market are not necessarily offering longer-term leases.  I would agree wholeheartedly with incentivisation of longer-term leases.  That can be done by way of certain tax measures if needs be.  That will provide security of tenure.  I know the Minister has to go.  This will be on the record of the House.<\/p>  <p>  To deal with the Labour Bill itself, the extension of rent pressure zones, RPZs, is required now.  The review that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, alluded to, which came to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government on 17 May 2018, just earlier this month, was in with a pile of other documents when we were trying to review Rebuilding Ireland.  As part of the review of Rebuilding Ireland, which in itself is a monster of a document to get through, was a discussion document of the options for RPZs.  I would fully support a review of RPZs.  That was refused when the original legislation came in.  We requested it and we need to look at it.  Deputy O'Sullivan specifically mentioned the issue of Limerick.  There are other cities and larger towns which have suffered.<\/p>  <p>  We know that the market is broken.  I looked at the quarter 4 report from the Residential Tenancies Board.  The average rent in Dublin is &euro;1,511 per month.  The average rent outside Dublin is &euro;1,103 per month.  The vast majority of people becoming homeless are those coming out of the private rental sector.  It is not working and Government measures are not working.  Tenants' rights need to be strengthened and there needs to be better security of tenure.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Murphy, said it was academic as to who produced houses and whether it was a turnkey or a local authority.  I will put some figures on record.  There is nothing academic about these.  If I look through local authority figures from last year, Rebuilding Ireland's own figures say 780 social houses were built.  There were not.  Some 394 were built by local authorities and 386 were purchased which were turnkey.  Turnkey is not just, as the Minister said, a little misleadingly, effectively council projects that they had initiated.  That is not true.  I know of turnkey properties in Fingal that have been purchased that were going out on the private market.  The State is competing in a shrunken market.  The couple or individual who is also working or trying to buy a house is competing with the State and the local authority because we are not building houses.  The Minister, Deputy Murphy, may answer this when he looks at the transcripts.<\/p>  <p>  There are 3,385 people on the housing list in Clare with no local authority builds or turnkeys in 2017.  In Leitrim, there are 420 people on the housing list and zero builds.  In Laois, there are 1,336 people on the list and zero builds.  There are zero in Monaghan, Offaly and South Dublin, where there are 7,552 people, and not one house has been built or bought.  Someone needs to talk to the chief executive there.  Someone in the Custom House needs to pick up the phone.  There are zero in Wicklow, with 2,749 people on the housing list.  Fingal, my own local authority area, tops the charts for builds, with 83.  That is the height of our ambition.  There were 16 purchased turnkeys.  That is 99 units.  Cork has the best output but there are nearly 7,500 people on the list.  I would nearly dispute that figure because it is higher than that.  There is overdependence on housing assistance payment, HAP, as a measure to say that people are housed.  HAP is not secure.  The transfer from the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, to HAP has been problematic.  We need to get our act together with the rental market and delivery of social and affordable homes.<\/p>  <p>  I want to talk about the use of State lands.  We have all heard about the Glass Bottle site, Oscar Traynor, all the famous sites, and O'Devaney Gardens where the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, went and announced that this would happen and nothing is happening.  The State controls 3,008 ha of land.  Some 1,317 of those hectares are controlled by the local authorities and nothing is happening on them.<\/p>  <p>  We have the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, which has accessed some land in Donabate where we want a housing mix.  There is a mix.  I heard Deputy Brendan Ryan referring to a change in Government policy in 2014 and 2015.  Looking at the delivery of social houses in 2014 and 2015, I would not be championing those as delivery of social houses either.  We have failed in that regard too.  Without an affordable housing scheme, we will not be able to move on.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister said at committee that he would sign the commencement of the affordable housing scheme, which was the old scheme that the previous Labour Party-Fine Gael Government stopped in 2012.  He was going to sign that back in and bring in regulations behind it.  That would be a start.  He said that two weeks ago, on 17 May.  When will that happen?  Across the House, in government, in opposition and in all parties, we want to work in a constructive way to see real improvements locally.  The Labour Bill is helpful.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Bill last night was helpful.  Our own Fianna F&aacute;il Bill was helpful.  Instead of Government just saying it will accept this on Second Stage, we need to produce the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill and bring in amendments to put effect to certain aspects of these Bills.  As I said last night, if that is not done, we will table amendments to the Bill ourselves and, as an Opposition, I believe we can work in a unified way to make sure that those amendments come into law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000033#LL00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1527690000,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this.  I will start at the point at which Deputy Darragh O'Brien concluded.  There have been a number of these Bills in this House.  It is frustrating from the Opposition point of view because of the time and delivery.  There has to be a mechanism to identify the key points in any of these Bills and have them delivered because they have the potential to have a significant impact.  I recognise that the Minister has left to review the monthly figures.<\/p>  <p>  I make the point in the observation, as Deputy Jan O'Sullivan did in her opening comments, that there are probably in the region of 10,000 homeless people.  I remind the Government that the first action in Rebuilding Ireland was to provide rapid build housing solutions to address this group of people in particular.  That has been a spectacular failure.  At the end of the year, something like 200 units were built out of an estimated target of 1,000.  The Government's own estimate would be less than 500 by the end of 2018.  This is having a significant negative impact on this group of 10,000 people who are homeless.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the issues relating to rent, residential tenancies and the high rents being charged are a result of supply and demand.  Many people who are in private rented accommodation do not want to be there.  They are applicants, people on social housing lists and people who ordinarily might want to buy their own house, and no properties are available.  Everybody is being squeezed into what is now a very tight market.  Until the Government significantly increases supply, this problem will persist.<\/p>  <p>  In one regard, we are tinkering at the edges.  We are not solving it, even bringing in rent controls and such.  Until we get to a stage where we have adequate supply in the market, we are not dealing with the fundamental issue.  We are bringing in somewhat temporary solutions.  I remind the Government that enabling funding for infrastructure was first announced in this House by the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, in October 2016 when he was doing the budget.  He announced &euro;50 million.  Virtually none of it has been drawn down.  That money has to be drawn down and spent to provide the enabling infrastructure to develop the housing projects.  On this side of the House, one can sometimes feel the frustration and concern that the projects are not moving at a quick enough pace.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen the rents and rate of increase over the past five or six years.  They are unsustainable for people in the short term and for long-term residents, even with the rent pressure zones.<\/p><p>They are consuming too much of a person's disposable income, especially in the greater Dublin area.  The situation will not change until we radically address the supply side.  The Government does not make it easy.  The Minister and the Taoiseach previously said there would be 3,800 social houses and they talk about all the other housing solutions but it is difficult to get clarity and detail as they will not name the schemes that make up the promised 3,800 houses.  It is a cloak and dagger situation.  The Government is hiding behind big numbers without providing the detail we deserve.<br\/><br\/>I wish to make some observations on the Bill, most of which we support.  There are concerns about the legality of having a national rent pressure zone but those issues could be addressed on Committee Stage.  People who are paying significant rents are entitled to a good standard of accommodation.  In my view the Government is negligent in that regard.  Tenants are not being adequately looked after.  There should be a greater regime of inspections.  Last year we saw an RT&Eacute; documentary which showed some of the conditions in which people live.  I tabled parliamentary questions to probe the issue and discovered the Government is providing &euro;2.5 million in 2018 to local authorities to provide inspections.  Incrementally, the Government will increase it to &euro;10 million by 2021, which would imply a one-in-four rate of inspection.  I do not see why we should have to endure such a delay before getting to that level of inspection.  There should be a reasonable prospect that properties would be inspected on a regular basis.  I do not mean a couple of times a year, but every four or five years, to ensure compliance.  I do not know why the Government is taking so long to do that given that only a relatively small amount of money is required.<br\/><br\/>In terms of security of tenure and the type of leases we have, it always struck me that if a landlord was renting a commercial property different rules would apply.  If the term of lease was five years it would mean five years and one would sell the property with the sitting tenant.  I fail to understand why we do not look at the matter in a more substantial way instead of tinkering around the edges.  When landlords give a lease for three or five years, regardless of whether there is an incentive, that must mean five years.  That happens every day with commercial property without any problems.<br\/><br\/>We have an anomaly on the residential side in that the landlord pays the local property tax but if it were a commercial property the tenant would pay the rates.  We should try to have a parallel system so that the conditions that apply to commercial properties would work to the same advantage of a tenant in a residential property.  That is not happening and I fail to see why that is the case.<br\/><br\/>In some cases I have seen, the behaviour and actions of receivers appointed by banks have been appalling.  They have moved in a reckless way both in regard to tenants and the previous owner of the property.  Properties were cleared out and left vacant for many years at a time of housing crisis before being eventually sold.  In some cases former tenants became squatters and property ended up in a poor condition.  The receivers did not serve anyone well.  Apart from the Labour Party proposal, I suggest that the operation of receivers and their agents must be regulated.  In my experience current regulation is either poor or non-existent.<br\/><br\/>Extending the legislation in terms of the notice to quit on the basis of requiring the property for family members and the grounds for same is a partial approach.  If we have professional landlords, whether they are the big institutional landlords, to whom the Minister referred, or single owners, the rules that apply to the commercial property sector should apply in residential property.  That would bring a lot more stability to the market where longer term leases of three, five or ten years would become the norm, with the annual rate of increase, whatever that might be.  That would be much more beneficial than putting in conditions on the reasons for sale.  The lease should mean the lease and it should be the norm to sell rented properties with the tenants <i>in situ<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000033#LL00300","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527690600,"counter":403,"content":"<p>This is the sixth or seventh opportunity I have had to speak on housing related matters in as many months.  I welcome the Labour Party Private Members&rsquo; Bill, and Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s Bill from last night.  We will do all we can to try to progress them.<\/p>  <p>  I agree very much with my colleague, Deputy Curran, that when it comes to the crisis we are all tinkering around the edges.  There is a major supply problem that could help address many of the issues yet we still uphold a process that is duplicative, cumbersome and too lengthy.  We have a lead-in time for local authority housing of between three and six years, and 18 months to three years in the private sector.  We need both if we are to deal with the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Given that we have architects, engineers, planners and experts in sanitary services in each of the 31 local authorities, the local authorities own the land and the Department says it has the money, why does it not give the money to the local authorities to design and build houses?  Deputy Darragh O'Brien has alluded to the amount of land in State and local authority control throughout the country.  Why does the process have to go to Dublin, back to Sligo, back to Dublin, down to the building unit in Ballina, back to Dublin and back down for more planners, architects and engineers to all do the same job?  It is unnecessary.  We have the expertise in local authorities in terms of planners, engineers and architects and if we need more then let us get them.  Let them do the job.  The building regulations are in place and the standards are set out.  If there is need for further oversight in terms of enforcement then that should be put in place, but let us get on with making less complicated what is a very simple process.  That is what needs to be done.  Otherwise, we are fighting fire with a bucket instead of a hose and it will keep getting bigger.  I do not understand why the Minister does not do that.<\/p>  <p>  In a previous debate I brought in what is ironically described as the Department's \"streamlined\" process for building local authority houses.  It is a significant volume, which is unnecessary.  Either people can do the job in local authorities or they cannot.  If they cannot, then we must examine the reason for that.  The local authorities own the land so let them build houses and get on with it.  We could have a national oversight or enforcement section that could travel around and check that standards are being upheld.<\/p>  <p>  On the private sector side, one of the fall-outs of the crash is that an awful lot of builders with expertise are now subservient, initially to NAMA and banks, and now to vulture funds.  They cannot get money for development finance.  While the banks will not say it on the record, they say off the record that they do not want to lend any money in tertiary areas.  Tertiary areas are effectively the entire country outside Dublin, Galway and a couple of other cities.  The banks will not lend and developers cannot get money.  Developers must have a minimum of 50% of the overall requirement.  Most parties, certainly Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, had references in manifestos to setting up a development finance bank.  It was done well in the past in terms of agricultural credit from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, ACC, and the Industrial Credit Corporation, ICC, which supported industry and commercial activity.  That needs to be done again.  We need 30 good underwriters, X amount of money and to start getting money out there to people who have the expertise and want to build because they can do it quicker than we can do it ourselves.  In local authorities it takes between three and six years to build houses.  We must get on with the job.<\/p>  <p>  Boarded-up units around the country are an important issue.  In Dublin alone there are 900 properties that have been boarded up for more than ten years, and one can add however many more to that number.  The situation is replicated in every town and village in the country.  We must do up those properties and get people living in them.<\/p>  <p>  I read somewhere that from a retail perspective we have enough retail space in Ireland for 15 million people.  Obviously, we do not have that number of people.  We were possibly able to support that under a false pretence during the boom based on credit.  We have a significant amount of retail space.  In the north west, for example, the high streets in towns in the areas I represent are full of empty units.  Let us incentivise the owners of such properties to provide for people to live over those units or even to live in some of the units which could be converted from shops to dwellings.<\/p><p>That would support existing retailers and would bring life back into towns and villages throughout the country.  The Department should consider incentives to make it attractive to people to live in an urban setting.  It could consider measures like providing free broadband or reducing refuse and other service charges.  In terms of the elderly, the Government should consider incentivising the building of units which have 24 hour concierge services attached, for example.  These are just some suggestions but if the Minister was only going to make one change, I ask him to tear up the streamlined process for local authority house building and do simply what ultimately is simple to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000034#MM00200","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527691200,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome and fully support the Labour Party Bill tabled by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  Most of the measures in the Bill are eminently sensible and should have been made law back in 2016 when we were debating the Government's Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill.  The Minister is not opposing this Bill today but he should sit down with Deputy O'Sullivan and other members of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and work this Bill's provisions into the upcoming Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2018 - not the second one that will come later in the year but the one that is due earlier in the summer.  When one looks at the proposals in the Bill, there is simply no reason not to support them.<\/p>  <p>  If one takes the definition of a landlord, the idea that a receiver who is accepting rent from a tenant, having been appointed by a bank on repossession, should not have all of the obligations of a landlord and that the tenant should not have the same protections under the Residential Tenancies Act makes no sense.  Good receivers are already doing it.  That is already the voluntary practice of the good receivers out there.  Some people have suggested that if the Residential Tenancies Act was tested, it would be found that receivers are included but why wait for that to happen?  We should just legislate for it.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the provision that a deposit should not exceed one month's rent, one must ask why landlords are currently seeking more than that.  They are doing that to avoid a criminal sanction for refusing tenants in receipt of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  They know now, because of the changes in law which we supported, that if they refuse tenants in receipt of social housing support they can be taken to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  They cannot refuse tenants on those grounds and this is the way they are doing it.  By not supporting this measure and including it in its own legislation, the Government is colluding with landlords who are refusing to accept social housing support tenants in HAP, RAS and other schemes.  That is something that is not supportable.<\/p>  <p>  On rent certainty, I say again what I said at the time that the legislation was introduced, namely that the idea that it is acceptable to allow a landlord to increase rent over three years by 12.5% in current market conditions is simply not on.  This is not 4%.  It allows for 4% plus an additional bit of interest over three years and the extra thousands of euro that will cost working and modest income families is simply money they do not have.<\/p>  <p>  I am very surprised that whoever wrote the Minister's script suggested that applying rent pressure zones State-wide would be unconstitutional.  It can only be unconstitutional if the measure was arbitrary and disproportionate.  The RTB's own rent index for the fourth quarter of last year showed that in Sligo, which is not in the rent pressure zones, the annual increase in rent was 29%.  Other areas that are not deemed to be rent pressure zones include Limerick, where the increase was 10%, Waterford city where the increase was 7.4%, while Mayo and Westmeath saw increases of 13%.  Clearly, there is a strong argument that given the disproportionately high levels of rent increases in those places, it would be completely constitutional to apply the rent pressure zones provisions to them.  If the Government will not do that, I ask that it would at least do what we have been requesting for more than a year, namely, allow the rent pressure zones to be calculated in those urban areas at electoral division rather than local electoral area so that we can incorporate those parts of Limerick city, Waterford city and Sligo town that are outside of the scheme currently.<\/p>  <p>  I fully support the restrictions on the notice to quit.  Deputy Curran put it best when he described the huge difference between the commercial and the residential rental sectors so I will not go into that further.  Obviously, the deposit protection scheme is not just good for tenants and landlords.  It would also save a huge amount of the time currently spent by the RTB on deposit retention cases.  Further, it would generate some additional income for the State because all of those deposits would be held in an escrow account and the interest would accrue to the RTB.  That additional income could be used to assist with the exercising of the new policing powers that the Government is about to give to the board.<\/p>  <p>  All of this is about fairness for tenants.  It is about providing better security of tenure and preventing homelessness.  I join Deputy Jan O'Sullivan in commending the four NGOs for publishing their hidden homelessness report today.  There is an overlap between the problems this Bill is attempting to address and the people who were spoken about so eloquently by the NGOs today.  I echo strongly the point made by Deputy Darragh O'Brien earlier.  The Government will be coming to the Oireachtas committee in a couple of weeks with a new Bill.  It is a Bill that we support and we have all said clearly at committee that it contains measures for which many of us have argued.  I urge the Government to put some of these measures into that Bill, the ones that are not complicated, are relatively straightforward and which can be progressed quickly.  If the Government does that, it will have even more enthusiastic support from the Opposition.  If it does not do that, just as if it refuses to address the issue of student rents, then Members of the Opposition will sit down together, table joint amendments and then force those amendments on to the Government.  It would be much better if the officials in the Department, using their expertise, crafted those amendments.  Indeed, we are happy to meet them and work with them beforehand.  I urge the Government to do this properly and provide tenants with the protections they so rightly deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000035#NN00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1527691200,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I welcome this Labour Party Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been saying for a long time that real rent certainty is needed in this State which requires linking rent increases to the consumer price index, CPI.  I particularly welcome section 4 of the Bill which deals with deposits.  We are hearing so many stories of landlords demanding not one but two or even three months' rent as a deposit.  Almost two thirds of tenants say that they have had difficulty getting their deposits back when their tenancies end.  It is clear that some landlords see the deposit as a way of increasing rents without breaching the rent pressure zone rules and this must stop.  Section 7 of the Bill deals with the serious issue of landlords ending tenancies because they are renovating properties.  We have all heard of instances where the so-called substantial changes amount to nothing more than a lick of paint or a new carpet.  Threshold has reported that almost one in eight eviction cases that it deals with are the result of landlords renovating properties.  While there have been some moves to tighten up the rules in this area, this loophole in the law is still being used.  There is a similar issue with landlords telling tenants that they have to leave because the property is required for a family member.  The provision in the Bill for a tightening up of who is considered to be a family member is welcome.  Section 9 provides for a rent register which is needed urgently because at the moment some landlords are using every loophole possible to get around the rent pressure zone restrictions.  It can be almost impossible for a new tenant to find out what the previous tenant was paying in rent.  In that context, a rent register would be very helpful in protecting tenants' rights and ensuring that they are not being ripped off.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to support this Bill because we need real action on protecting tenants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000035#NN00300","speaker":"1362"},{"type":"speech","time":1527691200,"counter":407,"content":"<p>The rental sector can be a precarious place for those who are renting so it is incumbent on local authorities and the Government to ensure that tenants have the greatest possible security of tenure.  This is vital so that families and individuals have stability and not just a sense of security, but actual security.  Unfortunately, this is something that a lot of tenants currently lack.  Rents have reached exorbitant levels in many areas, particularly in the larger cities.  Sustained and major increases in the cost of renting will result in more people living in insecure and often overcrowded housing, with some facing the prospect of being made homeless.  That is why the Government must link the cost of renting to the CPI as a matter of urgency.  It must legislate to regulate the boundaries within which rents can rise and fall.  There is no impediment to implementing such legislation.  The only objection would be from those who have a vested interest in the way rents are determined now, for whom fairness and security of tenure for tenants for the common good does not matter.  Linking rents to the CPI would require a simple change to the Residential Tenancies Act so that landlords would be unable to increase rents by more than the CPI figure in the period between the start of a lease and a new lease being agreed with current or new tenants.<\/p><p>This is already happening in countries like Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the US.

It is essential for us to provide for a clear definition of why a landlord requires vacancy of a property.

I have raised the issues being encountered by the Leeside residents in Cork on a number of occasions in this House.  The apartment building in which they live was purchased by the Lucas Capital vulture fund last year.  It is very clear that the vulture fund's agenda is to increase significantly the rents these residents are paying to live in their homes.  It is possible that they will be almost doubled.  The renovation work that was done on this building in recent weeks and months, while the residents continued to live there, turned the apartment complex into a building site.  Families with young children had to put up with masonry dust all over the place and the fierce smell of the varnish on the walls.  As a result of skylights being left open at night, puddles formed in the corridors when it rained heavily.  The use of drills and kango hammers caused a tremendous amount of noise.  Almost half of the parking spaces used by residents were taken from them to facilitate the work being done by construction workers.  It was clear that the agenda of the landlord was to drive the tenants out, even before an attempt was made to drive them out by doubling their rents.  I assure Lucas Capital and its representatives that every time they try to inflict their dirty tricks on the Leeside residents, we will call them out on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  We support the proposal in this Bill that \"reasonable measures\" must be taken to \"maintain the dwelling fit for human habitation during the refurbishment or renovation\".<\/p>  <p>  I note that the Minister has left the debate early to return to his Department to sign off this evening on the State's homelessness statistics for April.  It is a pity that those figures were not provided a couple of hours ago so that they could be a feature of this debate.  Instead, they will have to be debated in the media tonight and on the floor of the Chamber tomorrow.  As the number of homeless people approached the 10,000 mark at the end of March, the Minister did not respond by announcing rent controls, plans for the construction of more public housing or a ban on economic evictions.  Instead of making such announcements, he fiddled the March homelessness figures with breath-taking cynicism to keep the number of homeless people below the 10,000 level.  We will see the figures for April when they are released later this evening.  They will be debated in due course.<\/p>  <p>  More than 800,000 people, or approximately 20% of the population of the State, are living in rented accommodation.  This figure has doubled in the last decade.  Action urgently needs to be taken to ensure the provision of high-quality, affordable and secure housing in the rental sector.  Solidarity supports the limited proposals that are made in this Bill to that end.  We support the proposal to limit rent deposits to one month's rent, the removal of the sale of a property as a ground for termination of a tenancy and the disclosure on a published register of the rent payable on dwellings.  While we are prepared to vote in favour of the Bill at this Stage, if the Bill progresses we will bring forward amendments to it at a later Stage.  For example, we will propose an amendment to remove the provision that allows a tenancy to be terminated because a family member is seeking to take up residence.  We will also introduce a proposal that would reduce rents to affordable levels.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal in the Bill to allow rent increases in line with the consumer price index is wholly inadequate.  According to a recent Sherry FitzGerald survey, renters in Ireland are now paying a huge proportion of their net incomes on rent.  The survey found that renters in Dublin are paying an average of 55% of their net income on rent.  That is higher than the figure for London, Paris, San Francisco or any of the other cities in the world that were surveyed.  The figure for Cork is 37%, which is also very high.  That renters in Ireland face such a crushing financial burden is the inevitable outcome of the adherence of successive Governments to pro-landlord market-based responses that have failed time and again.  Successive Governments have poured increasing amounts of public money into the pockets of landlords, some of whom are in this Chamber.  No one should have to pay more than 20% to 25% of their net income on their housing costs.  I suggest that facilitating rent increases based on the consumer price index would merely copperfasten the charging of rents are already unaffordable.  We need to take strong action to reduce rents by as much as half, thereby returning them to affordable levels.  If this Bill progresses, Solidarity will introduce amendments to enable a rapid return to affordable rents.  In the meantime, we will support the Bill on Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000036#OO00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1527691800,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputy Michael Healy-Rae.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000036#OO00300","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1527691800,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It has been confirmed that a majority of those who are becoming homeless are from the private rented sector.  Many of my constituents in places like Bantry, Baltimore, Skibbereen, Kealkil, Clonakilty, Rosscarbery, Bandon and Kinsale, to name just a few, are unable to get on the property ladder and have to resort to paying huge rents.  The increase in rents is driving people out of rented accommodation.  Renting is often more expensive than making a monthly mortgage repayment.  In the week from 19 March to 25 March last, 9,681 people - adults and children - across Ireland were homeless.  The number of families becoming homeless has increased by 37% since March of last year.  More than one in three of those in emergency accommodation is a child.  Urgent action is needed to address this serious problem.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has said on many occasions that it plans to build more houses.  When it introduced the Rebuilding Ireland scheme last year, it promised to deliver 47,000 social housing units by the end of 2021 in a bid to tackle homelessness.  My concern is that this promise falls far short of the number of houses that are required if Ireland is to eliminate its housing crisis.  There are 90,000 households on the social housing waiting lists.  It has been promised that 47,000 social housing units will be delivered by 2021.  We are just three years away from that deadline.  Can we have certainty that the Government will deliver on this promise?  While we are waiting in the hope that the promised houses will be supplied, we must intervene to ensure people do not lose their homes, for example, by addressing the issues of security of tenure and rent certainty.  If better controls were put in place for things like security deposits, rent increases and termination procedures, they would go a long way towards giving tenants the protections they need.  Landlords would also benefit from the more protected environment that would exist if clear rules were in place.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to consider how to encourage more property owners to become landlords in order to reduce the extent of the housing crisis.  I have advocated on many occasions in this Chamber for vacant spaces above commercial units to be refurbished, thereby providing much-needed residential dwellings across west Cork and elsewhere.  If one drives through villages and towns like Ballinadee, Ballineen, Enniskeane, Dunmanway, Goleen, Kealkil, Leap, Schull and Skibbereen, one will see how many units above shops are vacant.  I have encouraged the Government to consider offering refurbishment grants for these vacant properties in a bid to ease the housing and homelessness crisis and to protect and restore rural Ireland.  It is time for the Government to listen and to take real action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000036#OO00500","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1527692400,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I want to declare an interest in this whole issue.  I feel privileged to talk about it.  The movers of the motion are dead right in what they are saying about security of tenure, particularly when we are talking about students.  We talked last night about the hardship students and parents go through when all they are trying to do is educate themselves, get on in life and have accommodation while they are doing so.  However, we have to be very measured and tempered in one thing.  This and previous Governments, going back as far as we want to go, have not provided adequately for people who need accommodation.  The private sector has had to make it up.<\/p>  <p>  I hate talking about anybody who is not in the Chamber but another Deputy said it was time rents were halved.  I agree 100% that we have to have realistic rents and do not want them to be too high.  At the same time, if people are going to be involved in the private sector, if they are going to purchase properties and renovate them, as Deputy Collins rightly said, and make them available, it is going to cost money.  They are going to need to have a reasonable and fair rent.  I am not talking about extortionate rent.  They have to make their payments and so on.  If it does not wash its face, it does not work.<\/p>  <p>  If a person gets &euro;100 in rent from a tenant, 60% of that goes back to the Government in one way or another.  The person who owns the property has &euro;40 out of every &euro;100.  That is a terrible important point for the Government to understand.  When other Deputies are talking about extortionate rent, they should remember that 60% is going back to the Government.  Maybe the Government should look at itself when it is talking about rents being too high.  Maybe it should consider doing something about tax.  If it wants to encourage people in the private sector, rather than having them pay over 50% tax it should give them a reduction.  Then they could afford to have cheaper rent for the tenants.  The Government should not land it all at the feet of those who are buying property and trying to make it available for rent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000037#PP00100","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1527692400,"counter":414,"content":"<p>This motion was proposed by the Labour Party.

The vast majority of landlords, however, are decent people trying to make a living and we need them in the market, as Deputy Michael Collins said.  We need incentives to ensure that they make properties available.  We have to have legislation that is quite strict to regulate them.  There is no place for rogue landlords.  For people to get on the property ladder, however, they need to start in rented accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The county councils are failing utterly to deliver houses.  A report this morning was found to have doubled the figures.  The Minister of State, Deputy English is in the Chamber.  They are including turnkey units as delivery.  We must get the county councils building and looking after people like they always did.  What is wrong with them that they are failing to have enough properties?<\/p>  <p>  During the negotiations on the programme for Government, I asked the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, if he would change the VAT rate for people to allow them, where shops had closed, to convert them back into living units.

It has been non-stop.  The recent Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill proposed by the Social Democrats was largely adopted by Government and some of the issues facing renters, including notice periods and enforcement of the 4% limit in rent pressure zones, were taken on board.  While the 4% measure was much needed at the time, rents were already way too high and unaffordable when it was adopted.  I am seeing more and more people having to top up the housing assistance payment, which is way below market rents.  It is a significant problem.  If the rent cannot be increased because the property is in a 4% rent pressure zone, invariably we see the landlord saying he is selling.  Almost daily, people are coming in to me with a copy of an eviction notice and an affidavit saying the house they are renting is for sale.  There is something quite dramatic happening at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot talk about rents without recognising the massive problems that the HAP scheme has created.  I understand the value of people being able to go to work.<\/p><p>It is preferable to its predecessor which tied people into a poverty trap.  It is certainly not the solution which is always going to be to build.  Some of us came forward with proposals in 2015 to use the European Investment Bank for such purposes.  The Government, however, was slow to take that on board.  It was said there was no money at the time but that was not true.  There was money.  It was a case of doing the things needed to access that money.  Those of us in the commuter belt could see the problem.  In my area, in a counter-cyclical manner, Intel hired 4,500 people.  While it was very welcome at the time of the downturn, it was obvious from that what was going to happen.  Some of us drew attention to those problems when the Labour Party held various Ministries.  Ultimately, we can tinker around the edges but it is important we do what can be done.  The key point is that we are not going to solve this problem unless we start to build.  We should stop codding ourselves about the figures which we saw today.  We want to see real houses in real places into which people can move.

Other than dealing with Brexit, it is the largest and most pressing public policy challenge that Ireland faces.  If people were honest about this, then we might be able to develop a solution which would actually work and produce houses rather than hot air.  There is an obvious uplift in house building in many parts of Dublin west, including in Carpenterstown, Ongar, Hansfield, Porterstown and Hollystown, which is welcome.<\/p>  <p>  However, it should be borne in mind that this area, along with the Dublin north area, is one of the few areas in the State where a significant number of houses have begun to be built.  In terms of the total national demand, however, it is a drop in the ocean.  There remains a massive pent-up demand which was obvious when anxious purchasers - Members might remember this because it was only a few weeks ago - were prepared to queue up for days when new homes in Hansfield went up for sale.  For those on the housing list, the situation is even graver as the supply of social housing lags behind with only a limited number of houses under construction in association with approved housing bodies.  I admire the work of approved housing bodies and, even more particularly, of housing co-operatives.  However, the scale of building required is simply not there.  These bodies are excellent.<\/p>  <p>  I have been at launches of 50 homes.  I see Ministers now being photographed at the launch of one home.  It is great news but there is no scale to it.  We need to be talking about tens of thousands of homes.  This is the core of the Government's problem.  I do not know if it is an ideological problem for Fine Gael.  I suspect it is that Fine Gael has a problem with renting on a lifetime basis and with social housing.  I grew up in a rented home along with my family until I was in my 20s.  I know that is not the experience of most Members.  Until relatively recently, however, it was the experience of tens of thousands of families.  Properly supervised and properly maintained, whether by housing association, the owner or the local authority, it works really well.<\/p>  <p>  Sites can only be developed if infrastructure, such as roads, water, sewerage, and electricity, is in place.

However, there are many other sites in all of the Dublin county areas, as well as in other cities and large towns around the country, which are zoned residential but which are awaiting pre-construction servicing.  This is one area, whether for affordable or private housing, where the measures have been so modest that at times they are utterly disappointing.  I remember as T&aacute;naiste getting a large tranche of money, agreed by the Government in budgets 2014 and 2015, to provide for necessary infrastructures such as roads, water and sewerage services into sites to develop them.  This Government has slowed down on all of that.  It has not pushed the boat out to achieve scale.<\/p>  <p>  A Government advisory body has urged action on one important matter, namely, the use of publicly owned land for building homes.  There is a substantial amount of such land in State ownership previously used, for example, in town and city centres for docks and rail depots.  Again, the Government has fallen behind in having the energy and leadership to actually unlock these assets which can be used to solve this problem.  On the corner of Molesworth Street and on Dawson Street, for example, there are three stunning large office building developments which have been completed on a massive scale.  They have been built and are ready for occupation in two years.  How is the private sector able to do that?  I accept it has to do with finance capital but I could show Members other examples all over the city.  Frawley's on Thomas Street is now being redone for student accommodation and it is flying along.  There are enormous sites on Dominick Street and in O'Devaney Gardens owned by Dublin City Council which were basically levelled ten to 12 years ago.  I take the Luas to look at Dominick Street and it drives me mad every time I pass by it.  People had proposals approximately three years ago to develop an urban garden there.  I was told by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor that machines would be on site.  I have yet to see one.  I am waiting for the day when I can spot construction starting on those sites.  O'Devaney Gardens is beside the Phoenix Park and is probably one of the best sites for housing in Europe.  It is lying idle, having been knocked for ten to 12 years.  It is entirely in the ownership of the city council.  I know I have raised this repeatedly but until some Minister is able to say why this has been left, I will not believe in the Government's real determination to show leadership and build and develop to the scale required.<\/p>  <p>  If one was to look back at our recent history, owning a home was a given in Ireland for most families earning the average industrial wage and above.<\/p><p>In a way, I do not believe we have thought about the fact that we are actually moving away from that.  It applies to people on higher incomes where two in the family are working, and this has consequences for childcare and so on.  Many Members know about this personally.  This has now become the model.<\/p> <p> Renting on a permanent basis has been a fact for people on lower incomes in all towns and village throughout Ireland down the generations.  Again, the Government seems to have abandoned this model and not enough is being developed.  There may be some building in small rural villages.  That is altogether welcome but previously there would have been sufficient supply for an expanding population.  In economic terms, our expanding population is one of the best things we have with regard to our position as a small open economy trying to make its way in the world.<\/p> <p> House purchases were used by people to supplement pensions and perhaps to leave something for their children or to pay for nursing home care in older age and so on.  That model is disappearing except for people in the top quintiles of income.  Again, I believe we have given insufficient thought to that.  We know the financial crisis of 2008 led to the collapse of the banks and the construction industry.  That has changed all of the assumptions.<\/p> <p> What about the teacher married to the nurse?  Such people are going to be between 35 and 38 years of age before they can buy a house together.  What are the social consequences?  This is one of the anomalies at the moment.  In financial terms, if such a couple could buy a house, their mortgage would be cheaper than their rent.  I am unsure whether the Government has considered that problem, but that is absurd in the context of the long-term sustainability of our particular model of people as stakeholders in their society.  What about two garda&iacute; setting up home together?  That profile seems to have vanished as well.<\/p> <p> A series of clear points arise in the context of this Bill.  The most important is the need for a recipe to bring together the issues of finance, land, construction and especially construction training.  We are not training anywhere near enough apprentices for the building industry.  The building industry is actually moving to a more skilled pre-built model throughout the world.  Yet, we are simply not at the races in that regard.

First, it is not something he would do.  Second, it is certainly not something he can do.  Either way, it is wrong and it cannot be repeated in the Chamber.  I have listened to this too often.

The same commentator told lies about me last week.  Deputies should cop on to themselves.  They should stop listening to and believing the commentators who say stuff without ever checking it.  They never ask the questions but they make their livelihood out of commentary without ever checking with the Department what is true or false.  Yet, some Deputies come to the Chamber and quote it as if it is gospel.  It is not true and there is no codding anyone.  We have asked local authorities to do turnkey.  In fact, local authorities have asked us to do it.  It works both ways.  We have asked local authorities to provide leasing, direct build and acquisition.  They need to keep going, do more and scale up, as Deputy Burton has said.  That is what we want them to do as quickly as possible.  We all want that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000039#RR00400","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1527693600,"counter":432,"content":"<p>The Minister of State would need to get his hard hat on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000039#RR00500","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1527693600,"counter":433,"content":"<p>We all want that.

A total of &euro;150 million has been spent.  Voids are an essential part and must be brought back into use.  The then Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, started it and we continued with it.  Deputy Alan Kelly was in the Department as well.  We always said there is no excuse for voids and they should not be there.  Far too many are left in Dublin.  There should be none and they will be dealt with.  There should not be many left at the end of this year &ndash; I can assure Deputies of that.  Some properties were set aside for regeneration but nothing has happened.  Again, that has gone on for far too long.  There is a long history of this, and it has not only happened under our watch.  It is not acceptable and it should not be happening.  We need to see things move on in some of those sites as well.<\/p>  <p>  Let us be clear on what turnkey is.  Turnkey is build-to-order.  Local authorities require the developer on an unfinished estate or a new site to provide good value and to deliver houses to the local authority.  To me, that is a normal way of doing business.  It is perfectly acceptable and I think it is a great way of doing business.  I believe we should do more of it because there is great value in some cases.  It will not work in every area but it is something we should do.<\/p>  <p>  Other comments were made by Deputy MacSharry about streamlining the process.  Again, we have had this debate during the past year or two and Deputy MacSharry has made the accusation that the system is out of order and so on.  We have made many changes to the system and to the protocol.  It is now down to a 59 stage protocol.  It took approximately seven or eight months of work last year with all the local authorities and housing bodies.  It involved everyone coming together to change the system.<\/p><p>It is a good system.  A lot of people in the local authorities sector have told me there was no guideline before.  There was never a set number of weeks for each part of the process.  They say it is nice to have that to work to.  We ask all local authorities and approved housing bodies to stick to the 59 weeks and not to take on projects which take three, four and five years.  Those days should be gone.  That happened in the past but the 59 week target is in place now.  If Deputy MacSharry wants to consult with a local authority, it will find it hard to admit that it can beat 59 weeks if the Department is taken out of the equation.  Most will say that even if there were not the different stages of checking in with the Department, they could not beat the 59 weeks.  If they can, I will compliment them.  We have ironed out a lot of the problems there.  In an ideal world, people will just say a local authority should go forward and not consult with anybody to build their houses.  It would change nothing about the timelines.  They would not deliver the houses any more quickly.  I am told that by the local authorities themselves.  Deputy MacSharry might want to check with whoever he is getting is feedback from, because it does not add up.  It is not true.  We have corrected the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000039#RR01800","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527694200,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I will let him know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000040#SS00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1527694200,"counter":448,"content":"<p>The Deputy might pass on the message to him.  He has managed again to be gone by the time I get up to speak.  It is important to correct these points in relation to housing because a great deal of work has gone into trying to change the system.  I compliment the local authorities involved.  People often ask why we have to open developments of ten or 12 houses.  It is for one reason only, namely that taxpayers need to know that money is being spent.  If one listens to the media or comes in here, one might think there is nothing happening.  I would love if there were 50, 100 or 1,000 but people need to know the money is getting through the system.  Very often, they hear comments from approved housing bodies, NGOs and others about solutions.  However, those people rarely mention that these are taxpayer funded solutions.  Every party represented here and every local authority member has committed a great deal of time and effort to drive the housing agenda.  Whenever I visit a housing development, I say that every party here has played its part.  However, we are all spending taxpayers&rsquo; money and they need to be able to see it is driving solutions.  That is why it is important to do that every chance we get.  I always say that regardless of changes in government, the D&aacute;il has committed the &euro;6 billion and money beyond that to deliver housing projects.

If it had been there, I have no doubt that Deputy Howlin would have found the money and got it spent as quickly as he could.

Deputy Murphy said we could have built houses in 2011.  In 2011, the country was on its knees.  Our indebtedness was 30% of GDP, which was higher than that of Zimbabwe.  That was a nominal figure.  The actual figure, even taking out the bank debt, was 11% of GDP.  We had no money to spend.  Deputy Murphy thinks we could borrow the money from the European Investment Bank.  I met the European Investment Bank at the time.  I brought its representatives to Dublin.  The very first meeting they ever had outside Luxembourg was in Dublin at my invitation.  They would provide us with a loan but we could not borrow money because we were required to reduce our indebtedness from 11% of GDP to 3% or we would have no money to pay for health, social welfare and everything else.  The first thing we need in the House is honesty about how we address and solve these issues.  We have a habit of always trying to resolve the last crisis after the fact.  The economy crashed in 2008 due to reckless bank lending and a property bubble.  For most of the time we were in government, there was no property market.  Nobody could tell one what was the value of houses because there was no market for them.  Nobody was building houses because the builders had collapsed.  The notion that it was a normal time merits revisiting given that we were barely clinging to economic survival.  Let us be honest.  It is nice and comfortable for people to make jibes, but if we are going to resolve the real crisis we now face, we must act collectively.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has worked on many fine Bills in the housing area.  This Bill contains a set of measures which would provide real support to the most embattled cohort of people right now, namely, those in the rental sector.  They are genuinely being crucified across the country.  Rent hikes have been monumental over the past five years or so.  Rents are now higher than they were at the peak of the boom in 2007 and 2008.  As my colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, has said it is perversely the case that the cost of rent is more oppressive than mortgages at current rates.  If there were only houses for people to buy and they could convert what they were paying in rent into mortgages, they would be better off and in the process of acquiring their own homes and settling their circumstances forever more.  That is the reality.<\/p>  <p>  Figures revealed by RT&Eacute; today show that half of new homes listed as local authority builds were bought directly from a builder or developer.  Half of these houses were bought.  I heard the Minister of State say that is the way it should be and that we are doing everything.  However, he is saying, in essence, that the few bob the State has is now being used to compete with-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000040#SS01000","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1527694200,"counter":456,"content":"<p>They are built to order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000040#SS01100","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1527694200,"counter":457,"content":"<p>They are not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000040#SS01200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1527694200,"counter":458,"content":"<p>They are not competing.

Half of the so-called \"council builds\" were actually purchased.  That is instead of having two streams to bring homes onto the market, one involving houses built by local authorities as they used to do when we had housing departments buying land years in advance, servicing it and building according to need, and a separate stream of houses coming from developers to service the private market.  The problem is that we do not have anything like enough of the old-fashioned local authority houses.  We are sitting on hundreds of acres of land.  We have all identified it.  Notionally, we have allocated the resources.  When moneys became available, my very first act was to allocate the first few bob we got to social housing.  There were problems, however.  Let us be honest again.  In the early part of the 2000s, there was a policy to hollow out the capacity of local authorities to build houses and to rely instead on the private sector to build and lease back properties.  It was the wrong policy and it had a doubly negative effect.<\/p><p>Not only did it incentivise the private sector to build houses and create a boom, it also hollowed out the capacity of local authorities.  In 2014, when we had our first few bob, I allocated it to housing as our very first measure because it was the number one social priority.  That was four years ago.  I was told quickly that the local authorities did not have the capacity to build the houses and I had to immediately allocate additional staffing.  I had to alter the restriction on employment to housing departments because they had not got housing officers in the same way as they had for decades previously, and we are only getting to that stage now.  There was a lag because of the policies that were developed over time.<\/p> <p> Now let us recognise, as I thought we did across this House, that the biggest social challenge we face - there will be Brexit and other issues - as a community and as a nation is housing.  There are too many people with no certainty about the roof they have over their heads and too many young people almost abandoning the notion that they will ever be able to afford to own their own house.  Let us do something about it collectively.  For God's sake, let Deputies top scoring points off one another,  with them running in here for five minutes, making a few mumbled charges and running out again solves no problems for anybody.  Let us try to collectively allocate the resources - it is our constitutional role to Vote money - agree on the plan and, in the interim, when we need to solve the big issue which is the supply-side issue, utilise the landbanks we have, utilise the money we have available and the capacity within the local authorities and other State agencies and agree to quickly embrace proposals like those put forward by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan to ease the burden now on those in the rented sector so that they do not face rent hikes above the CPI.<\/p> <p> Members come in here stating we should halve rents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000040#SS01800","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527694800,"counter":465,"content":"<p>It is nonsense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000041#TT00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1527694800,"counter":466,"content":"<p>They know that is nonsense.

Will the Minister agree to provide schools with the additional resources?  At present, if pupils opt out, often they go somewhere, such as a library or, worse still, maybe to a corridor, or they sit at the back of the class.  Parents affected by this have made it clear that they do not want their children in this invidious position.<\/p>  <p>  There has also been many references in the Bill to religious instruction taking place either at the beginning or at the end of the day.  We heard that, particularly from some of the groups which came in and addressed the committee.  What I am concerned about is whether the Minister will clarify what resources he will put into this?  The organisation of this will take considerable resources.  It would be better to leave it to the after-school period or to have it early in the school day so that it would involve the minimum disruption.<\/p>  <p>  Many children dislike being left out of what is seen to be an activity of the school.  It can be quite invidious and quite alienating for them to be left out, and parents also find it so.  It is necessary for the Department of Education and Skills to make it clear to schools that there ought to be discussions in schools about how this sensitive issue is dealt with.  One should bear in mind that in many schools in Dublin West, as in many areas around Dublin, there are the 70 to 90 flags of different countries which pupils come from.  Many of our schools, at both primary and second level, have 1,000 pupils.<\/p><p>When we talk about people coming from every continent on the globe, we are talking about a lot of religious affiliations and people from different backgrounds.  We are also talking about significant numbers of children who may have no religious affiliation.  A lot of Catholic and traditional parish schools are extremely welcoming of children from diverse backgrounds.  It is, however, very difficult to be inclusive, as schools want to be, when they have religious curriculum at the heart of the school day and when there are some who are not for it, perhaps because they are of a religion that is not the religion of the patron of the school.  It is an issue that needs to be faced.  School principals are acquiring more and more managerial responsibilities.  As the Minister knows, it is becoming more difficult to get a lot of people to apply to become school principals because there are so many sensitive issues that need to be managed.  Will he share his thoughts on how he will provide for this in terms of the provision of resources? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000041#TT02700","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527695400,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I have tabled amendments Nos. 89 and 104 in this group.  Amendment No. 89 would require the Minister to provide guidelines for schools on how they should put in place age-appropriate alternatives for children who do not wish to attend classes in religious instruction,  The Minister must set minimum standards for the nature of exemptions for students who do not want to attend classes in religious instruction.  This would ensure freedom from discrimination and protection of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion in schools.  The Bill, in section 62(7)(n), already provides that a school should provide details of its policy on arrangements to meet parents' wishes or those of any student over 18 years who does not wish to attend classes in religious instruction.  Government amendment No. 69 also ensures a student cannot miss a day of school if he or she does not attend classes in religious instruction.  The next logical step is to ensure the Minister will set guidelines to ensure all students will be treated equally across schools when they opt out of classes in religious instruction.  In February the Minister issued a circular to all ETB schools requiring them to provide alternative subject choices for students who wished to opt out of classes in religious instruction, but it only applies to ETB schools, the logic being they are multi-denominational.  The amendment would compel the Minister to issue guidelines to all schools.  <\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 104 would require the Minister in his regulations to set age-appropriate guidelines for primary and post-primary schools, respectively, for students who did not wish to attend classes in religious instruction in publicly funded schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000042#UU00200","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1527695400,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Will Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett move amendment No. 5?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000042#UU00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1527695400,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p><blockquote>In page 4, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:&ldquo;(2) Section 15(2) of the Act of 1998 is amended by the insertion of the following paragraph after paragraph (g): <blockquote>&ldquo;(h) in performing the functions conferred on it, and notwithstanding subsection (2)(b), a board shall uphold equal respect and dignity for all pupils, regardless of religion, ethnicity or family background, and uphold their constitutional rights under Articles 44.2.3 and 44.2.4, specifically by ensuring no religious instruction or faith formation take place during class time.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>The amendment seeks to remove religious instruction and faith formation from class hours and allow for it to take place after class hours.  This is in line with our view that in an education system which is publicly funded - even private schools are publicly funded - there should be a curriculum taught which is inclusive of everybody and does not have a bias in favour of or prefer a particular religious ethos or does not seek to impose a particular moral or religious view of the world.  I do not see how it is the job of a publicly funded education system and the curriculum that goes with it to teach people about particular religious preferences.  I do not see how they two go together.  Do not get me wrong - people are entitled to their religious views.  I would fight to defend people's right to freedom of religious expression and association, but that is a separate matter from education.  I am not saying people cannot privately make the decision to fund a religious education, although to me it is just about teaching a particular world view.  I do not accept the idea that in an education system which is supposed to be in place to deliver a curriculum for everybody part of the day should be about teaching a particular moral world view is legitimate.  <\/p><p>I know the historical reasons it happened and they have got the country into a terrible mess.  We outsourced education largely to the Catholic Church and there was a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>which for people like Archbishop McQuaid was, &quot;We will run the schools, but we get to indoctrinate the kids&quot;.  That is what it came down to.  I do not think that is acceptable.  Religious instruction should be removed from normal school hours, but that is not to say I do not think we should not have as part of the curriculum the study of different belief systems, taught in an objective, fair an even-handed way because I absolutely think we should.  We should have classes in philosophy - call it what one likes - in which different religious and non-religious world views or philosophies are taught to people as education about the world.  Catholicism and any other religious view would be part of it, but it should not be prioritised in a school setting over and above other world views.  <\/p><p>To my mind, it is a very simple position.  No matter what stipulations are included about schools having to make alternative arrangements for children who do not have religious views or have minority religious views, in effect, they mark them out.  It means that the State is supporting creating a certain religious and moral atmosphere which is imposed on children who may not share that view or whose parents may not share it.  That is not right.  That is my view and the purpose of the amendment.  It is in line with a general view that we need to separate church and State in all areas and recognise that they are different.  The jobs of the State and the particular religious institutions are different.  In this state they have become intertwined and entangled in a way that has been toxic and unhealthy.  The adoption scandal that erupted in the past few days, about which the people concerned have been campaigning for years, is of relevance to the issue of education because what happened and what potentially could happen is that the particular ethos and interest of a religious institution cut across what might have been the best interests of a child or service user who was in the care of a particular religious institution with its particular moral view.  That is exactly what happened in the case of the adoption scandal because the Catholic Church had certain attitudes about parents who were not married.  They were mothers who were not married and the Church had certain attitudes.  That impacted on its ability to deliver what should have been just a welfare service for mothers and children.  There is the same potential as long as there is an intertwining between church and State of particular religious and moral views and the delivery of what should be an education system which is equal and fair to everybody.  That is my view.  It is on that basis that I have moved the amendment which I will be pressing to a vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000042#UU00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1527695400,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I will speak to amendments Nos. 6, 31 and 139 which concern the same issue.  They would place a requirement on schools to place religious instruction or what is referred to as faith formation at the end of the school day in order that children who do not share the same belief system as that of the patron could avoid participating in it.<\/p><p>Parents have a constitutional right to have their children opt out of religious instruction and the only meaningful way this can be vindicated is if it is pushed to the end of the school day.  Having religious instruction class within the school day entails segregating children and that is not a good practice.  Within a school we should not divide or segregate children on the basis of their religion.  We should be trying to encourage mutually respectful situations in our schools and respect for diversity and difference.  One does not encourage that view by separating and segregating children.<\/p> <p> The proposal for religious instruction classes to happen outside the regular school day is reasonable.  If the school finishes at 2.30 p.m., it can happen then for the convenience of parents.  Nobody has any difficulty with different denominational groups using a publicly-funded premises for instruction for convenience purposes.  For children who do not share the belief system for which there is a religious instruction class, it is very important that this change is made.<\/p> <p> I was concerned to hear the Minister last night making a reference to children of no religion going to Educate Together schools.  That comment absolutely misses the point.  It may have been a slip of the tongue.  Educate Together schools are not schools for people of no religion; they are multidenominational schools and the multidenominational aspect of the school is one of the four key principles underpinning Educate Together.  It is about respect for difference and bringing children together from different socioeconomic backgrounds, from different faith systems or none, and from different areas so that there is a vibrant mix within the school.  It is really good for young people to work with, play with and be in the same classroom as people from different backgrounds and who have different views.  It creates a great dynamic in schools to have that kind of diversity and that is what the Educate Together model is very much about.  I was lucky to have been involved in the first Educate Together school on the north side of Dublin in 1983 and my own three children were able to attend, as was Deputy Burton's daughter.  We very much valued the richness that came from a school that valued diversity and that is what our education system should be about.  It should be about bringing children together and not separating them or dividing them.<\/p> <p> Last night we talked about patronage and the baptism barrier but even within a school that has a denominational patronage, we should still strive to bring children together and respect difference and diversity, rather than drawing attention to difference.  It is often seen as penalising children if they have to be taken out of a class to do something else and it separates them from their peers, which is not a good thing: it is not good practice to do that.  For far too long the State has been quite happy to outsource education and healthcare to religious organisations but we should now be able to move beyond that.  We should be a modern republic and ensure our institutions reflect that.  Part and parcel of this is developing our own civic ethic but there has been very little time or consideration put into this.  What is the moral code we want our young people and older people to live by?  Can we have a debate about how we encourage respect for difference, honesty and integrity in our young people?  There is a way of doing that which also includes respecting people who have a particular religious belief system.  The way to do it is through a general course provided within schools.  It is not one denomination over another but is about what the Educate Together schools call the core curriculum.  This curriculum is devised by parents and staff in the school and reflects the moral code which we should all be striving to live by.  It does not exclude anybody.  It is about bringing people together, having mutual respect, treating people well, being honest, understanding and recognising different belief systems and accommodating all of that in an inclusive way rather than in a way that divides.<\/p> <p> I strongly appeal to the Minister to listen to the views of so many parents from all backgrounds, from all religious belief systems and none, who want their children to be part of an inclusive society for which we should be striving.  Separating people for religious instruction absolutely works against that objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000042#UU00500","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527696000,"counter":496,"content":"<p>These amendments, in particular amendments Nos. 30 and 31, get to the heart of a debate that will open up more and more in society in the coming years.  We saw the incredible and tremendous scale of the victory at the weekend and it speaks to a desire of large sections of people for a very different society from the one we have had, with an end to the domination of the Catholic Church and the oppression of women.  This is a struggle for equality and against oppression and a key part of that is the struggle for a secular society, where there is separation of church and State and where everybody's rights to practise religion are fully protected by the State, with no interference whatsoever.  It is also, however, a society in which the State's resources are not used to promote any particular religion.<\/p>  <p>  The key battlegrounds for a secular society are in education and healthcare, where the lack of a secular society has a daily impact on people's lives.  Amendment No. 30 gets to the heart of the matter in respect of the education system.  It is repugnant to me, as a secularist, that public funds and resources are used to promote different religions, in particular the Catholic Church which covers close to 95% of primary schools.  I also happen to be an atheist but that does not inform my views in this case.  We will not deal with this issue unless we enact something like what we are proposing in amendment No. 30, which is to remove all religious instruction and faith formation from school hours.  That is because these are hours for which teaching staff are being paid by the public's taxes.  It also proposes that \"religious instruction and faith formation relating to or arising from the characteristic ethos of the school shall not...permeate education\".  These demands are quite basic and simple.  They are asks but they are asks that have been implemented in other countries, such as in the US.  The US is a religious society but there is separation of church and state.<\/p><p>That is what needs to be done if we are to have a secular society.  We must have a separation of the two.  We cannot have a promotion of religion in this way.<\/p> <p> The points have been well made as to the impact of this on people.  It is a pressure on children to participate in a particular religious education and, if they do not, the consequence is their potential social exclusion.  It has negative consequences for children.  Parents have the right that the children would hear about whatever religion they are a part of or advocate for, but they do not have the right to expect that the public would fund that through public schools and then put pressure on children, in effect, to experience that through religious education in school.  For me, this is obvious and simple.  We should not have religious education happening in our school system.<\/p> <p> Clearly, the Government's approach is not to accept that.  I presume the amendments will not pass because Fianna F&aacute;il will go along with the Government, but I advise the Minister this issue is not going to go away.  It has become clear that Fine Gael's approach to these issues of church-State relations is more skilful and a little more flexible than previous Governments.  The Government has recognised which way the wind is blowing and has decided it is better to bend with that pressure rather than to face church-State relations being broken and the end of the State's reliance on, and outsourcing to, the church, but ultimately it will not work.<\/p> <p> The movement of people who successfully repealed the eighth amendment will not just leave it there.  They are turning their attention to all questions relating to education and health, and the Government's piecemeal approach to bend a little on the baptism barrier but not to deal with it fundamentally, to bend a very small amount on this issue before us but not to deal with it, and to bend a little on sex education by saying we will have a new curriculum but we will not deal with the religious ethos issue, which is at the core of why we cannot have objective sex education, will not be accepted.  People will increasingly demand that each of these issues be dealt with but, more generally, they will say we need a separation of church and State in this country.  We will have a major movement around that.  It is quite clear that movement will ultimately be successful.  The question is how long and how far the Government and various establishment parties will resist that rising demand and how much resistance they will put up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000043#VV00200","speaker":"1433","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527696600,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Did Deputy Burton indicate she wished to speak?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000044#WW00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1527696600,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I made a comment already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000044#WW00300","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1527696600,"counter":500,"content":"<p>My apologies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000044#WW00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1527696600,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I moved amendment No. 5 but I should also have moved amendment No. 30.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000044#WW00500","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1527696600,"counter":502,"content":"<p>The Deputy cannot move amendment No. 30 until we reach it.

There is a strong case for that.  It happens already, as alluded to by Deputy Shortall, in multidenominational schools where religious instruction is provided, in some cases to the majority of pupils, depending on the parents' wishes, and it seems to happen pretty seamlessly.  There are practical issues.  It would not be fair on schools to implement it straight away.  There is an opportunity for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills to examine this issue, in particular, in the autumn and to invite in the stakeholders.  It is important in our education system that we do not simply make laws and hand them down but that we bring the stakeholders along.  That is the way the education system has worked in Ireland and the reason it has become the one it is today.  I would be reluctant to support the amendments on that basis without in any way challenging the ethos of schools.<\/p>  <p>  If we were to deal with the fact that say, for example, in rural Ireland there is one school in a parish or a village where parents do not subscribe to its ethos, it will not be possible for the State to provide a multiplicity of school ethoses in those areas and it might be better if faith formation were done at the end of the school day.  It will also not be realistic to have wholescale divestment of schools from the various patrons.  This might be a way of dealing with the issue and I do not believe anyone has anything to fear from it.  There are practical implications to it, however, and there may well be resourcing implications also.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister issued a circular to the education and training boards, ETB, sector recently demanding that they provide alternatives to religious education without providing the resources for that.  While it may have got the Minister a fantastic headline to the effect that he is moving with the times and so on, on a practical basis it will not work in schools because they do not have the resources.  In terms of any of these issues, I will not subscribe to the approach of just legislating for this today.  The same applies to the Minister's circular on ETBs on which there was no consultation or announcement.  The Oireachtas committee can examine this in some detail with the stakeholders later in the year or early next year to see first if it is an issue.  It may well be the case that we could give schools the option but there is certainly an argument for it and it already works well.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to patronage, and I said this last night, the Minister is embarking on a complicated process in terms of finding out who the patrons might be for the 42 schools he announced on 13 April.  I am shocked to hear stories about the type of canvassing and negative campaigning that has been undertaken in some areas when this patronage issue has arisen.  These are State schools we are providing.  We have a multiplicity of religious denomination schools in the country and it seems that the education and training board sector is the most appropriate vehicle to take these schools.  We can ensure there are a sufficient number of Gaelscoileanna as well through that model.<\/p>  <p>  The process the Minister is undertaking this summer in terms deciphering the patronage is putting a huge administrative burden on his Department and on the patron bodies which, in some cases, do not have the resources.  It might be better simply to state that these are State schools and should remain in State patronage.  That would be efficient and would pursue the goals we share of further diversity in the education sector.  It is clear from the Minister's statements that it is open to religious patrons to canvass for religious ethos schools, even where there is sufficient supply, and it would be open to patron bodies for Gaelscoileanna to canvass for Gaelscoileanna where there is already a Gaelscoil.  That is something we believe is unnecessary and I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider the patronage campaign that will now have to be embarked on by these groups and organisations, including the State sector, that is, the Minister's ETBs, which will have to spend a good deal of money on this to introduce themselves to people.  I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider that.  It would take a huge administrative burden off his Department, bring clarity to the process and allow the ETBs to focus on the location of the sites for these schools, particularly the 21 starting in September 2019.  It would also allow them to recruit principals for these schools.  That would give some leadership, direction and identification to potential parents who would be seeking to send their children to those schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000044#WW01000","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1527696600,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I will start by declaring a conflict of interest.

I have been ten years involved in the same school in Schull in west Cork, but not once has religion been put before the interests of the child.

The child came first, and I have first-hand experience of that.  That has been the case during the time I have been a chairperson and a member of the board.  The child always came first.  I would like to calculate the amount of time we spent talking about religion on that board in ten years but I can safely say it did not take up too many hours because it was not an issue.<\/p><p>The child and the teaching of the child always came first in the school.  That is the most important thing.  I could not speak about this if I was not on a board, but I am and I know exactly what it is like.  Nobody wants to admit that only for the local priest the school would not be there.  Some people want to get rid of the church from schools, but they do not realise that it was Fr. Hurley, God rest his soul, who came up with the idea some years ago that we would build a school in Schull where male and female pupils could attend.  We closed the convent school and the boys' national school and we now have one fabulous school going forward with a super principal, Mr. Diarmuid Duggan.<\/p> <p> Reference was made to the difficulties faced by children who are of no religion or different religions when there are communions in the school.  The schools accommodate this, in the same way they accommodate a pupil who may not need to learn Irish or other pupils.  It does not mean that we have to shut down the school because a pupil is not able to do Irish.  It does not mean that if a child cannot do physical education there is an issue.  The schools accommodate these cases.<\/p> <p> There has to be an understanding that the church is not all that bad as people proclaim it to be with regard to schools.  It really comes down to the principal and how he or she runs the school, and to the board of management.  Boards of management are made up of various representatives: two from the church, two from the community, two from the parents' association and two teachers' representatives.  The church is totally outnumbered on the board so Deputies should not worry about that.  I am a community representative on our board of management.  People might say I should be a political representative but I was on the board over many years before I went into politics and people decided it was okay; it was up to the community to make that decision, not me.<\/p> <p> I do not like to hear church bashing.  Obviously there may need to be changes and people need to be aware that those children who have no religion need to be in these same schools.  These pupils must be accepted with open arms the same as everybody else.  This is the way it has been in the national school I represent and I am proud of this.  I would not be on the board of management if it was any different.  I never ask anyone about this.  It is the same in politics: I do not ask anyone about their colour or their creed.  When they come into my office I deal with their issues and do not even ask which constituency they come from.  That is the way I have always been.<\/p> <p> I stress that there are more important issues such as the pupil-teacher ratio in primary school classes.  This is far more important for the education of our children.  From junior infants through to sixth class this ratio must be reduced.  It is vital that we stand up for the rights of our children's education.  This is a far more important issue according to the parents with whom I speak.  The children are our future.<\/p> <p> Another important issue affecting schools is the capitation grant.   We should be discussing this issue today because I am aware that schools, led by the principals, are out there - as a politician once said - with our paws out.  We are looking for money to keep the basics going, to fill the oil tank in the school and to pay for the secretary.  The money is not there because the capitation grant is not meeting the needs of the schools.  It is not just the local national school in west Cork: this is replicated throughout the State in every other national school.  It is a very difficult situation for schools to be in.  They should not have to be in this situation and it is a far more important matter to be addressed than amendment No. 31 that we are currently discussing.<\/p> <p> I wish to bring the serious issue of school waiting lists to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  It has become a huge issue.  While I understand there are certain rules around feeder schools for second level students I feel that every parent and child who applies to a school should receive a direct, written response.  There should be a more transparent way to be more open, for the purposes of parents' understanding the why, where and when.  I am currently dealing with a situation where children were taken in from a non-feeder school before feeder school children were taken in.  The parent concerned is very stressed, cannot understand why and feels the child was victimised.  The parent is seeking an answer because the current rules and regulations state that the child would be taken from a feeder school before a child from a non-feeder school.  It did not happen, unfortunately, in this case.<\/p> <p> My constituency covers a vast area, and I accept it is not hugely populated, but nobody is coming to my office asking for the religious to be out of the schools.  People are, however, coming to see me about the capitation grants, special needs assistants and all the other issues I have just referred to.  These are the issues that really concern parents.  Anybody who is in touch with parents knows that these are the issues they want resolved.  I would appreciate if the Minister would focus more on those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000044#WW01300","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527697200,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Are other Members offering?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000045#XX00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1527697200,"counter":512,"content":"<p>The Minister will respond and then there will be another round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000045#XX00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1527697200,"counter":513,"content":"<p>There are two minutes remaining for any Member who wishes to speak.

Of course everyone recognises that Ireland is changing, but we also start from a position where 95% of schools are denominated and 99% of schools are privately owned.  What we are really discussing is how to address the absolute constitutional right of a child to opt out of the religious activities within the school, if he or she chooses.  This is what we are trying to do and this is what my amendment provides for.  Clearly, many people take the more radical view of taking religion out of schools altogether and not using schools for any form of religious instruction.  These are legitimately held different points of view.  I seek to develop the provision for children who want to opt out and to make sure it is a good provision.  Over the last years, since the forum on patronage, good practice was indicated.  The forum indicated good practice such as online lessons for the particular lesson of the child or staggering the times of the religion class so it could accommodate different children.  It emphasised that each school should have its own approach and not a one size fits all approach, as some Deputies claim.  It was also suggested that religion class could be put at the end of the school day, but the patronage discussion did not come out in favour of that idea because it meant that some parents would have to collect their children earlier, and it appeared that these children were being excluded from some of the school activities.  This might not be optimal.<\/p>  <p>  If we want to change this then we need consultation.  We cannot suddenly decide in the House that we are going to impose a set of rules immediately.  The patronage forum indicated the need for flexibility.  There are some very good practices emerging within denominational schools that have to be respected.  They are valuable.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies raised many other issues.  Deputy Thomas Byrne spoke about confining new schools to education and training boards, but this would exclude Educate Together and Gaelscoileanna.  The system I continue to apply is an independent group, recommending that diversity is a requirement of the process, parental choice being allowed and patrons being allowed to apply.  It does not mean that a majority patron can deliver diversity.  Clearly a majority patron cannot meet one of the critical criteria if all the existing schools, or the vast majority, are of that denomination.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Collins spoke about transparency.  This is what the Bill is all about.  It makes it absolutely clear there will be a written policy of admission.  We will ban waiting lists and there will be openness.  We will not use religion as a criterion for selection in Catholic schools.  There will be much greater clarity but schools can still have the sibling rule, which can override the feeder school.  The schools can decide.  The schools will have published admissions policies, but each school will have freedom within it.  If my amendment passes, religion will not be a criterion to exclude a child.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, I cannot do justice in two minutes to many of the points being raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000045#XX00900","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527697800,"counter":520,"content":"<p>We have had an interesting discussion.

This is an important issue for communities, schools and institutions.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Shortall about the Educate Together model, which started approximately 40 years ago in the Dalkey School Project in Dublin when there was less diversity.  In fairness to some of the Deputies who have contributed, they do not represent constituencies that have the level of diversity seen in Dublin West, where 30% of the population have parents who were not born in Ireland or were not born in Ireland themselves.<\/p>  <p>  I want to tell the Minister something that might also cheer up Deputy Michael Collins.  At a school opening a week ago, the Taoiseach effectively promised an increase in the capitation in the budget.  He did not write that down, but he certainly said it to many people.<\/p>  <p>  We need a national discussion on this matter and to find a mechanism that is inclusive of different desires.  A school with 30 religions and 70 or 80 nationalities is the reality in certain areas of Dublin West.  In fairness, Catholic parish schools have been very inclusive down the years, but whether people of the Catholic faith are open and inclusive towards people of other faiths or none - they are - is not the issue.  Rather, there are practical arrangements to be considered.

For some time, several people have been referring to the need for a national debate and engagement on the future of our schools.  It is extraordinary that over 90% of primary schools are under the patronage of the Catholic Church, which does not reflect the Ireland of nowadays.

At second level, for example, it is not as much of an issue because invariably there is choice and new schools follow the ETB model, which is what I suggest the Minister should consider to stop the unseemly fighting for patronage.  That fight is not fair and is a waste of resources.<\/p>  <p>  We must acknowledge that some people are put out by the fact that religion is taught in our current system.  We can examine this matter.  Deputy Boyd Barrett claims to know the position.  He may well be right, but where education is concerned, we need to talk to everyone.  That is just how the system works.  Maybe we can change the system by legislating day in, day out and throwing new rules on top of people, but that would never work.  The education partners will rise to the challenge and we will get something with which everyone agrees.<\/p>  <p>  No one wants a full State-run education system.  By and large, Catholic schools throughout the country have done a fantastic job, particularly at primary level, of accommodating diversity and immigrants.<\/p><p>Other schools simply do not want to do so.  As Deputy Joan Burton says, it has to be acknowledged that they are there.  There is no Catholic school in the country other than the small number that are oversubscribed that has refused anyone of any faith.  The baptism barrier will be removed for the small number that are oversubscribed.  The key for them is to provide for the provision.  I would love to see a system in place where there was genuine diversity where it could be provided for by the State such that if somebody wanted to go to a religious school, he or she would not be threatened by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett or Deputy Paul Murphy saying there should not be religious instruction in schools.  At the same time, if a neighbour does not want to go to a religious school, there should be provision for him or her too.  If that cannot be provided for in villages or the west in places where there is only one school, we should come to some compromise such as looking at having religion instruction outside class hours.  We should look at this issue very carefully.<\/p> <p> There is no issue with religious education in the United Kingdom.  There are issues with bits and pieces of the rules, but Catholic schools, Protestant schools and Muslim schools are all accepted because they do not dominate the educational landscape.  They do not comprise a figure of 90%.  The number is much lower than it is here.  There is diversity and the United Kingdom does not have these ideological debates all of the time.  Perhaps it is necessary to have them when one church comprises a figure of 90%, but the focus in England is relentlessly on school funding, resources and buildings.

The Government would not be moving to do something about it if it was.  I have met multiple parents who had a real difficulty in getting their kids into school.

I do not agree with him that the problem is not religious schools but the preponderance of religious schools.  I agree that the preponderance of Catholic schools, at over 90%, exacerbates the problem massively and makes it huge, but there is a more fundamental problem in having publicly funded schools - they may be privately owned but they would not exist without public funding for teachers - promoting religion.

It will not deal with these problems.  It will just create others.  The only way to deal with it is not to deal with the flip-end of the constitutional right of the student not to be forced to attend classes in religious instruction but to deal with it in an holistic way and start with a publicly run, publicly funded education system that does not include the promotion of religion.

It is not fair on students, teachers or parents.  It is a timetable hazard and a nightmare for a principal.  There are many scenarios.  There are children who are not participating in religious instruction sitting at the back of the classroom.  There are disciplinary nightmares for the teacher and children are listening to religious instruction as they try to study.  There are schools which decide pupils can go to the library while religious instruction is taking place.  Who supervises them?  Sometimes they are not supervised.  Who is the teacher who draws the short straw and has to do that duty instead of teaching his or her own subject?  There is the situation where students study other subjects.  This happens too in the case of Irish.  Sometimes, in some schools, there are more students who are not taking Irish and there are no guidelines whatsoever for the schools on how to deal with the issue.

If he insists on religious instruction taking place during the school day, guidelines are needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000047#ZZ00300","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1527698400,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I listened to Deputy Paul Murphy who talked about the gentleman who was a Hindu and who had been asked to have his child baptised.  There are such cases which are wrong, but the biggest issue is overcrowding which we are trying to address in the context of baptisms.  Schools are in a dreadful position where there is overcrowding and are looking at the criteria.  Feeder schools and non-feeder schools have different criteria.  Is that wrong?  Is it wrong for feeder schools to pick one or another thing?  In this country we fail, as do the Government and the Minister, to acknowledge properly the role the religious have played in schools.  We fail to stand up and are afraid to do so.  It is wrong of us not to do so because they have done some incredible work during the years.  I know of one school in west Cork that wanted to build an extension, for which the Department gave 50%, 60% or 70% of the funding.  The rest had to be raised in the local community.  The board of management could not raise it, nor could the parents' association.  The local church took out a loan for the school.  Except for it, the extension would never have been built.  People fail to recognise this.  If the churches are removed, who will take over responsibility for taking out loans for schools?  I know the school first-hand and can talk about it.  It is attended by Latvians, Lithuanians, English children, Poles, Germans, Dutch children, Catholics and Church of Ireland children and atheists and everybody works fine together.  I cannot understand it.  One would swear they were all at war.  When I come into the D&aacute;il Chamber, on a regular basis I ask what is happening in other parts of the country.  They must all be involved in a fierce conflict.  They should come and spend time in west Cork which Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett probably knows fairly well.  They would see that there was harmony, that people were getting on fine and that there was no major hassle with reference to what is continuously discussed here.  People are pleading to have issues such as capitation resolved, as well as teachers' pay.  <\/p>  <p>  I would appreciate it if we could look at both sides of the argument here.  The churches have parish halls.  I have gone to different parish halls, Church of Ireland or otherwise, and nobody has ever asked me at the entrance what my religion or creed is.

Pupil-teacher ratios are important and we need to have targets to reduce them substantially.  I accept that there are issues with teachers' pay, resources, capitation grants and so on.  I would not minimise the impact segregation can have on children or the pressure being put on children.  Are we not dealing in this Chamber with the impact of moral views imposed on women and children, which resulted in mothers being forcibly separated from their children because of the religious views of Archbishop McQuaid and his followers?  This is serious.  They are dealing with the consequences because a social service was outsourced to people with a particular religious view.  I am not saying anything as drastic as that is happening.<\/p><p>The subtle impact on children who feel isolated and have particular views imposed on them can be quite damaging.  Sometimes people can be afraid to talk about them.<\/p> <p> On a practical level, I have had a long debate with the Minister about the fact that he feels unable to do anything about the Christian Brothers wanting to sell off the playing fields at Clonkeen College.  He has said there is nothing he can do and that the Christian Brothers are allowed to do so.  Nobody could argue that their actions to protect themselves are not adversely affecting the students.  There is something wrong with an education model where the patron of a school can do something that is blatantly and self-evidently against the interests of the schoolchildren in its care, yet it is allowed to persist.  It is not an isolated example.  I have referred to a similar case in Waterford where the Sisters of Charity are doing the same.  There is a problem and it can only be solved by separating church and State in the area of education and also in health, while respecting and protecting the right of people to associate and express particular religious views but not in publicly funded school time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000047#ZZ00600","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527699000,"counter":537,"content":"<p>That concludes the debate on a series of amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000048#AAA00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1527699000,"counter":538,"content":"<p>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett was given an extra two minutes because he had tabled an amendment.

This is an ongoing issue.  The child alleges that she has been and is being very badly bullied online and in the school.  A transfer has been sought to another school where it is believed she could get away from the bullying.  The parents are worried about her possibly being suicidal and have a very definite preference as to which school they would like her to go, but the school is refusing to let her in and giving what are rather concocted reasons that do not really stand up.  As a result, she has now been out of school for several months.  The parents' section 29 appeal was refused because it was over the 45 day time limit, which applies from the refusal of the school board.  They did not know about the time limit applied.  It seems very unfair and the child is now not in any school.  The parents have doctors saying the girl needs to go to another school where she would feel safe and would not feel she would continue to be a victim of bullying.  I know that section 29 relates to the appeals process.  Can the Minister provide some reassurance?  I am glad to hear that he would have to be notified if there was a refusal, but I would like to know a little more about the process.  It is very disappointing if efforts are being made to save a child from serious bullying, especially given the very serious concerns of the parents about her welfare, if there is a refusal on spurious grounds and the parents' right to appeal is ruled out.  To me, it does not seem to be a great process.  If the Minister's officials are agreeable, I will contact them to look into the case.  Perhaps the Minister might also give me some confidence that the proposed amendments to section 29 will make the process better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000051#DDD02600","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1527700500,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I am quite happy to assess what has taken place.

I understand there is a 45 day period within which an appeal has to be lodged.  If it is lodged within the appeal period and there is a concocted reason, the appeal board will scrutinise it and will have the power to direct.  From memory, I think 40% of appeals are upheld.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides that Tusla, educational welfare services, will receive a power to require a school to admit a child who is out of school.  That is one of the powers we are granting to Tusla, just as we are granting to the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, the power to require a school to take a child with special educational needs.  There are defences offered by schools that are upheld by an appeals committee, as well as those that are rejected.  Without knowing the exact circumstances, I cannot comment on the case referred to.  Unfortunately, there are always procedures and time limits.  There will be procedures set out in the new arrangement.  I will check with my officials where the 45 day limit came from and to see whether parents need to be alerted to it.

forward amendments on Committee Stage Bill to enable a special school or special class to refuse admission to children who do not have the category or categories of special educational needs being

I hope they achieve the desired effect.  I have seen some special schools treat children inappropriately, particularly when dealing with expulsion or suspension, which is similar to admission.  I do not want to see any barriers put up for children with special needs.  This genuinely has the child&rsquo;s interests at heart and it should not be a barrier for the school to say it does not want certain classes of children with special educational needs.  Special schools and mainstream schools with special classes are finding it difficult to deal with the issue of behavioural challenges.  I know the National Council for Special Education has included this in its review, which was launched today.  That is welcome but what I am hearing on the ground is that due to the legal liability regarding assaults by pupils on other pupils - I am talking about assaults by children with special educational needs, in particular, who let us be frank do not know what they are doing, are not deliberately setting out to harm others and have a behavioural challenge - is such that insurance costs for some of these schools are becoming prohibitive.  A fundamental problem is that teachers or SNAs do not have the necessary training to deal with children with challenging behaviour.  Has the issue of insurance for special schools been brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention?  If it has, does he propose to give extra resources to deal with pupils in such circumstances?  I would not like to see children with behavioural challenges excluded from schools because of the criteria he is putting forward in these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000052#EEE01000","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1527701100,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy's comment.

Many years ago I attended summer Irish colleges which were great places to go to.  The bean an t&iacute; does great work in promoting and sustaining the Irish language.

It is a reasonable request that all those who have tabled amendments on this issue pull back to see if some compromise which addresses all concerns can be achieved in order that there can be an all-party consensus when the Bill goes to the Seanad.

The backdrop to the provision is that on Committee Stage we discussed this issue.  A number of Opposition Deputies were keen for us to introduce a provision to allow children with a level of fluency preferential access to Gaelscoileanna and ensure that it would be an acceptable basis and not breach the Equal Status Act.  It was on that basis that I consulted, obtained legal advice and drew up an amendment.  I will set it out before we make a decision on how to proceed.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment provides that Gaelscoileanna or Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; can give priority if they are satisfied that a proposed entrant has achieved a reasonable level of age-related fluency and that that level of fluency will regress if the child does not gain access to a Gaelscoil or Gaelchol&aacute;iste, as the case may be.  We do not seek to and do not differentiate in the amendment between how that level of fluency was acquired.  We do not give na&iacute;onra&iacute; feeder school status.  Therefore, we hinge it on a level of fluency established by the child, not on the child having the money to go to a na&iacute;onra.  We do not want to give feeder school status to particular preschools because we are not doing so elsewhere.  We also do not provide that there be an interview with the parents and do not say the school will have entry tests.  We say instead that it is up to the parent to choose how to demonstrate that the child has achieved fluency.  We also provide that where children have reached a level of fluency that will regress if they do not gain access to a Gaelscoil or Gaelchol&aacute;iste, they will not be ranked by fluency.  It is establishing a level of fluency that will give them access.  <\/p>  <p>  I can understand what has been put forward in the amendments tabled by the Opposition.  The proposal is that from within the group of children who have achieved a level of fluency, additional priority, above and beyond all those children who have a level of fluency, be given to a child who normally speaks to one of his or her parents in Irish in the home and who displays a minimum level of Irish associated with speaking Irish to one parent.<\/p><p>I do not have a profound objection to accepting amendments Nos. 76 and 77, as well as my own, amendment No. 75.  There are some quibbles with the way they are drafted in terms of how one establishes what is normal communication between one parent and a child.  A school can establish at some level that a child or a parent has a level of fluency, but it is harder to demonstrate that the parent normally speaks Irish to the child in the home.  At second level one would be establishing a priority for a child from a feeder school, to which I have no profound objection.<\/p> <p> The thinking behind our approach is that the State has an obligation to support the promotion of the language, but we do not want to prefer a group of children who acquired their language proficiency in talking to a parent, a grandparent or a brother or as the result of a big effort made by the family to immerse a child in the Irish language, even if the parent did not have the opportunity to speak it.  We do not seek to distinguish them and that is the thinking behind our provision.  I do not have a clear-cut view on whether it is satisfactory, legally, to give priority to someone who is defined as having spoken Irish to one of his or her parents in the home over someone who has the same level of fluency but who acquired it in a different way.  That is an issue that needs consideration if the Deputies are convinced that the amendment I have developed is not sufficient.<\/p> <p> We can do this in one of two ways.  We could accept amendments Nos. 76 and 77, as well my own, amendment No. 75.  Deputy Thomas Byrne proposes to give preference to someone who speaks Irish as their language in the home over and above a child who acquires it otherwise.  He also proposes that a post-primary school accept evidence from a primary school principal that a child speaks Irish in order to carry on at second level.  If I were to accept the Deputies' amendments, I would want to have them suitably scrubbed by legal advisers before we went with them to the Seanad where it might be necessary to amend them which would require us to come back here.  After the discussion we had on Committee Stage, my officials and the Office of the Attorney General tried faithfully to get what had been sought.

However, if it is established that the information is false or misleading, it can withdraw an offer, but only if that information was false or misleading in a material respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000064#RRR00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1527707400,"counter":726,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1527707400,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 69:<\/p><blockquote>In page 19, line 20, after &quot;school&quot; to insert the following:<br \/><br \/>&quot;(which arrangements shall not result in a reduction in the school day in respect of the student concerned)&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000064#RRR00500","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1527707400,"counter":728,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1527707400,"counter":729,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 70 and 86 are being taken together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000064#RRR00700","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1527707400,"counter":730,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 70:<\/p><blockquote>In page 19, line 29, to delete &quot;attendance&quot; and substitute &quot;enrolment&quot;.<\/blockquote><p>These amendments substitutes the word &quot;enrolment&quot; for the word &quot;attendance&quot; in sections 62(7)(p)(ii) and 64(1)(b), both of which are concerned with prohibiting fees or charges as a &quot;condition of admission or continued attendance&quot; at  a school.

Amendment No. 82 deletes the reference to &quot;the intake group&quot; in section 63(1) in light of amendments to later provisions in this section which clarify that the admission notice applies to the intake group and to special classes.  Amendment No. 83 clarifies that the admission notice must indicate the dates by which an applicant will be notified of the school's decision and the dates by which an applicant must accept any offer in the case of both the intake group and any special class.  The existing provision does not make this clear.  Amendment No. 84 clarifies the wording of this provision to clarify that the admission notice must separately specify the number of places in the intake group and in any special class and that must also separately provide details of any oversubscription in the intake group or the special class concerned in the previous school year.

We must remember that the vast majority are voluntary boards made up of volunteers from all kinds of backgrounds.  It is a big stick to beat them with without giving them the resources.  We have to give them resources.  They do not have resources and we know what an onerous job it is.  This will make it much more onerous and difficult.  They are trying to keep the buildings standing.  They are trying to apply for emergency funding for summer works and everything else and there is no certainty around that either.  It is a thankless job and this will make it much more so.  It is typical of what is happening right across the voluntary sector with all the threats people face with compliance.  I accept we have to have compliance but there have been serious problems and people are flying away from voluntary service.  I am not happy with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000070#XXX00700","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1527709800,"counter":845,"content":"<p>What we have here is a situation where people have been doing voluntary work, particularly in recent years when schools were finding it more and more difficult.  It was boards of management that actively fundraised and did so much work in keeping their schools going.  We have all been involved in helping and assisting schools in our areas in putting together money and helping them with applications for emergency works where roofs were leaking.  The great work that has been done by boards of management, parents, teachers and people involved in the religious sector, which was touched on earlier tonight, has kept the doors of our schools open.  The one fear I have, which has already been mentioned, is that a lot of what has been proposed can create further red tape.  Red tape is the bane of everybody's life at the moment because it is not about what work one actually does but how one complies with the work one is undertaking.  We have seen in other sectors that 30% to 35% of contracts can go on health and safety.  While we are all very interested in health and safety, we seem to be losing the run of ourselves.  I am worried about the red tape that might be involved in this and what it would mean for compliance.  I have a concern that it would mean people would need to be book-keepers and accountants to comply with all the regulations and the red tape that is being put in front of them.  It is no harm to put on the record the great work that has been done by boards of management and all of the people who worked and who are working voluntarily and doing their best to keep their schools open.  We often have situations in rural Ireland where the boards of management are resorting to actively campaigning to bring new families into areas to ensure the schools are able to keep their doors opened.  For example, in a beautiful part of County Kerry, Lauragh, they are actively campaigning to make sure they have enough students to keep their school open.  We had the same situation over the years in places like the Black Valley where excellent teaching is being carried out but where it is a struggle sometimes to keep student numbers up.  It is a big campaign by boards of management.  Not only do they have to help in financing the school, running the budget and making sure that everything checks and balances but at the same time they must campaign and actively canvass to try to have new young families comes to the area so they will put their children into those schools and keep the schools open for the next generations.  It is good to compliment those people for their voluntary efforts and for the great work they are doing.<\/p>  <p>  It was touched on earlier but the contribution that has been made by the people in involved in religion, including the priests, in their communities and the excellent service they have given should never be ignored.  The contribution they have made to Irish education should never be ignored, left out or forgotten about because they certainly played a big part in keeping schools open at a time when many of them might have been closed due to centralisation and other budgetary constraints.  If not for the voluntary fundraising that went on when Government failed and was not able to fundraise, many of the schools would not have been able to progress, expand or modernise in the way they have.  I compliment them all on their great work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000070#XXX00800","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1527709800,"counter":846,"content":"<p>I know Deputies have seven minutes but in section 69, the reference to admission policy includes the reference to the admission notice so by no stretch of the imagination did the Deputy's contribution keep within that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000070#XXX00900","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1527709800,"counter":847,"content":"<p>I spoke earlier on other amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000070#XXX01000","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1527709800,"counter":848,"content":"<p>This one is about the admission notice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000070#XXX01100","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1527709800,"counter":849,"content":"<p>I always talk from experience.
