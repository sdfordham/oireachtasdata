In the certificate I draw attention to note 35, which elaborates on the issue.  I will summarise it.  Note 35 states that medical cards were not renewed for 2.7% of renewal applications received in 2012 because the applicants no longer satisfied the eligibility criteria.  At the point at which a person who had been a medical card holder applied for its renewal at the end of the normal cycle, the HSE review found that 2.7% of them had become ineligible.  The likelihood is that at least some of those were not eligible for a medical card during the period in which they held one.  That is the element that has not been quantified.  It is quite difficult to project backwards to find out at what point somebody ceased to be eligible for a medical card.<\/p><p>  There was an additional group involved - again, this is outlined in more detail in note 35.  Eligibility for medical cards was removed for 0.8% of the total medical card population in 2012 following a request from the HSE for card holders to confirm their residence in the State in cases in which a medical card had been inactive for significant periods.   Essentially, the HSE, in a review of medical cards, selected the group of individuals whose cards had had no transactions or charges other than the flat rate payment and asked those people to confirm their details of residence in the State.  I do not recall the number of individuals who lost their eligibility but it represented 0.8% of the total number of medical cards held.  There are issues that seem to indicate that there is a material level of card holding by individuals who are not currently eligible, and it is a challenge for the HSE to put a precise value on this.<\/p><p>  This matter does not affect the charges on the account.  We are satisfied that the amount paid out is correct.  It is more an irregularity, akin to overpayments or excess payments in the area of social protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000005#D01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1371720000,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I have a direct question for the Comptroller and Auditor General on the 0.8% of people in receipt of a medical card who may not have been resident in the State or were not using the card.

Item No. 3 A.1, from the DDDA, includes notes for a sub-committee meeting of the board on 5 October 2005 in respect of the Glass Bottle site.  To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time we have had reference made to the meeting.  I stand to be corrected if I am wrong.  The note makes reference to a small meeting that took place on 5 October with regard to the Glass Bottle site.  All of the meetings we discussed have been of the full board and this is the first time a sub-committee of the board met on the matter of the site.  What is significant about the information in the minutes of the meeting is the reference to the concept of development profit varying from &euro;350 million to &euro;1.1 billion.  It is the first time, during discussions on this, that we have heard talk of profit.  It is a discussion about the Glass Bottle site but the Glass Bottle site is not mentioned once in the minutes of the meeting.  Reference is made to Dublin Port and the fact that the DDDA sought 5% in regard to its role as a broker.  What is the 5% figure referring to?  Why has no one brought this up before?  Mr. Bradshaw will attend next week and we are having a discussion on how to progress this.  We have not had reference to this meeting previously.  It brings a new dimension to the issue that was not visible in the contributions witnesses made with regard to development profit and the fact the authority was, at one point, looking to put in place a fee structure in respect of negotiation between it and Dublin Port.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000006#E00600","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371720600,"counter":120,"content":"<p>The existence of this document was mentioned by Ms Moylan when she appeared before the committee.

Mr. Matthew Elderfield appeared before the committee last week and was questioned by me and Deputy Donohoe on prosecutions over the past five years and the lack of progress in bringing people before the courts and attaining prosecutions.  He made some comments that were so weighty that they need to be acted upon.<\/p> <p>He said that in the case of individuals against firms, the law had not been changed.  The capabilities had not been improved sufficiently to bring people to justice where there was suspicion they had broken the law when it came to infractions in regard to finance, etc.  As a committee, and based on the evidence he gave, we need to have some kind of follow up quickly.  I think he tried to nudge and prompt the committee to look into this matter.  My take on what he said was that there really was not a spearhead in Government looking at this sufficiently even after five years and that there were lacunae in the law when it came to bringing prosecutions.  <\/p><p> I understand there is some opportunity for us, when we look at the issues surrounding banking, to include something which could go to Government, based on what Mr. Elderfield said.  He was quite open and I believe it is something on which we should act immediately and to which we should give the time it deserves.  We should ask the questions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, his own office, the Central Bank, everybody involved in this in government, in particular the Department of Justice and Equality, and the Office of Corporate Enforcement.  We should ask if suggestions have been made by the Financial Regulator in this regard, have they been followed up?

I am extremely concerned that Ms Moylan, who is the most senior planning official in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, attended this meeting, was involved in this discussion and the impact this has on the knowledge the Department had at the time of the workings of the DDDA.  This correspondence raises significant questions for the Department.  Ms Moylan's recollection at the last committee meeting was not complete and was perhaps sketchy.  It is likely we will have more questions for her in regard to her role as a member of the board of the DDDA and wearing her other hat as an Assistant Secretary General in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.

It is based on a 2011 analysis but it has become very problematic.  I am not exaggerating when I say that in the region worst affected by the recession, the sector most badly affected within that region, the retail sector, has been very negatively affected by this process.  In some cases, the retail sector in Waterford city and county has seen commercial rates double or even treble.  The average increase in the retail sector is between 40% and 50%.  At the same time, the large industrial players in the region have seen their rates decrease substantially.  The accusation that is being made by the retail sector is that there is a massive disconnect between Dublin and what is going on at ground level and having examined the data in recent days, I believe there is some truth to that.  The administrative system was devised and put into operation in a different economic time.  The policy behind it needs to be examined.  It is an issue for everyone in this room because the entire country is going to go through this process.  It is not confined to Waterford, Dublin and Limerick.  We have a problem here.  The people in the Valuation Office are doing their job and doing it well.  They were given a task and indeed, there is some logic to revaluing properties but the effect it is having on one sector is extremely detrimental and does not make sense for the economies that exist, particularly in Waterford.  There are issues here with regard to value for money.  The Valuation Office has appeared before this committee before and we need to ask about the processes and procedures being followed.  There is also a policy issue here<i> vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> the Department of Finance and whether it understands the effect this is having on businesses around the country.  It is not an insignificant matter, at a time when people in businesses are on their knees, to get a bill which amounts to a doubling or tripling of one's commercial rates.  Such bills will send a lot of businesses to the wall.  In many cases, business people have told me that will have to lay off staff if they have to pay their new commercial rate bills.  That has an effect on the State in terms of the payment of unemployment benefits and so forth.  The process that has been undertaken by the Valuation Office is having a significant impact and it cannot be ignored.   My region is one of the worst affected by the recession, with 20% unemployment.  The worst-affected sector within that region, retail, is being targeted here and I do not think we can ignore that.<\/p><p>  I am asking that we contact the Department of Finance to ask about the larger, macro-economic issues that are resulting from this revaluation process, if possible.  At the very least, it would make sense for this committee to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000008#G01500","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speech","time":1371721800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>We had the Accounting Officer for the Valuation Office before us some time ago.

Some of the issues that arise are matters for this morning's second session with the HSE and the Department of Health rather than SIPTU.<\/p><p>  The social partnership model in the management of public sector bodies aimed to achieve improved co-operation between management and staff in addressing challenges in the delivery of public services and to modernise the practice of industrial relations in the public sector.  To achieve this, a number of collaborative arrangements were put in place to identify required training and development and oversee their delivery.  The initiatives implemented for the health sector included the health service national partnership forum, which was established in 1999, and the SKILL programme, which commenced in 2004.  Similar partnership arrangements were put in place in the local authority sector, including the local authority national partnership advisory group, which was established in 1999.<\/p><p>  Previous reports from my office looked at the partnership arrangements in the health sector and found weaknesses in the way public funds had been administered.  In the course of those examinations, it was found that there had been substantial payments of public money from multiple sources into a bank account called the SIPTU national health and local authority levy fund account.  Following concerns expressed at a meeting of the committee about the operation of this fund, I undertook an inspection of its accounts.  Before I outline the key findings of the inspection, I want to comment briefly on the availability of relevant records about the transactions on the fund.  The fund bank account was established in late 1998 by a senior SIPTU official, who acted as the fund administrator, and a health sector employee who was a SIPTU member.  Formal SIPTU approval for the establishment of the fund bank account was not sought.  Fund transactions were not processed through SIPTU's financial system.  SIPTU took control of the fund bank account in 2010 and subsequently closed it.  The fund administrator did not put in place a formal system of accounting for fund transactions.  Bank records were available for movements on the account from January 2002.<\/p><p>  SIPTU arranged for annual financial statements to be compiled retrospectively from the bank records.  These statements were made available in full to the inspection team.  To supplement those records, the inspection team verified a sample of payments through direct confirmation by identified suppliers and individuals.  The team also examined the records of funds allocated and payments made in the public bodies that provided money to the fund.  We asked the fund administrator for a copy of a report prepared by a firm of accountants on his own behalf and for any supporting documentation.  He declined to make them available to the inspection team.  The inspection found that public money totalling &euro;4.15 million was available to the fund in the period from 2002 to 2009.  Funding of approximately &euro;1 million was returned to State bodies between late 2010 and December 2012.  Accordingly, the net cost to taxpayers of the operations of the fund between 2002 and 2011 was approximately &euro;3.15 million.<\/p><p>  Concerns were expressed by the HSE about the destination of some public money paid over to the fund.  Records of the issues from public bodies and receipts by the fund prior to 2002 are incomplete.  The inspection team found no evidence of misappropriation of public money issued to the fund in that period.  It also found that all of the public money identified as having been issued by public bodies in the period from 2002 to 2009 was lodged to the fund.  The inspection team found that the funding bodies had not specified clearly the purposes for which most of the funding was provided.  The lack of specific direction as to how the money should be used allowed a degree of flexibility by the fund administrator in responding to demands, so long as they were within overall partnership objectives.<\/p><p>  Public money was provided to the fund through a complex chain of funding transfers.  This created a risk that there would be confusion among the funding bodies about responsibility for ensuring adequate oversight and accountability.  In the event, there was no effective oversight or formal accountability for the fund's operations.  Most of the public funding was made available in advance of expenditure, in the form of grants.  There were instances in which grant funding was provided just before the end of the year.  This could indicate that funding bodies used the fund as a mechanism to avoid surrender of unused partnership funding.  This resulted in the fund's building up a cash balance that was significantly in excess of its immediate business needs.<\/p><p>  Between 2002 and 2009, approximately &euro;2.2 million was spent on training programmes and grants.  This type of expenditure is consistent with the broad partnership objectives stated by funders.  However, the inspection found significant amounts of expenditure which were less clearly within the scope of those objectives, such as expenditure on marketing and promotion, travel and accommodation, and hospitality.  In some instances, employees of public bodies engaged in foreign travel that was arranged and paid for from the fund.  Such arrangements are inappropriate because they bypass internal controls on the charging of and accountability for foreign travel expenditure incurred by public employees.  Details of those trips were discussed by the committee at a previous hearing.<\/p><p>  In addition, the inspection team identified transactions relating to further foreign travel, the details of which are presented in the report in figure 3.3.  The expenditure involved is approximately &euro;46,000 and comprises mainly credit card payments for flights and accommodation.  The precise number of trips cannot be determined because, in most cases, the credit card statements record the dates when payments were made, which may or may not coincide with the dates of travel.  The fund administrators stated that most of these trips had a legitimate business purpose, but did not give details.  No documentary evidence was available which enabled us to determine the purpose of those trips, or how they related to the work of the fund.  The examination found that significant refunds were made to the fund account by individuals, especially in 2010 after concern emerged about the fund's operations.  This included refunds for the expenses of persons who had accompanied officials on trips.  Due to the incompleteness of the records, the inspection team was not able to match these to specific payments, or to conclude whether all refunds due were repaid.<\/p><p>  While the relevant public bodies failed to put service level agreements in place with the fund administrator, or to implement appropriate control and accountability arrangements, the fund administrator had an obligation to manage properly the public money entrusted to him.  At a minimum, he should have kept sufficient and appropriate books of accounts to make it possible to determine in a timely way how each element of funding had been used and what balance, if any, remained.  He should also have sought clarification from the relevant funder if he had any doubts about the appropriateness of proposed expenditure.  Furthermore, he should have reviewed the adequacy of the arrangements in place when the level of annual funding received doubled in 2003 and again in 2004 and in 2007.<\/p><p>  The development and operation of the fund raises a number of issues of general concern in relation to the administration of grant funding by public bodies.  The report sets out a number of recommendations designed to improve control over, and accountability for, State grants.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has indicated that it accepts the recommendations and proposes to progress them through a joint working group between the Department and my office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1371723000,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

We are not a public body and, as such, we appreciate the fact that the committee has acceded to our request to attend.<\/p><p>  SIPTU is the largest trade union in Ireland, representing more than 200,000 members, two thirds of whom work in the private sector and one third in the public sector.  We are a membership organisation with approximately 10,000 voluntary representatives working through an extensive membership network of locations throughout the country.  The union was organised on a branch based structure until October 2010 when it was restructured along divisional lines.  Within the union, the term &quot;levy fund&quot; has had a specific meaning.  It indicates an account operated by a branch under its own control and rules and governed by branch trustees.  Crucially, such funds derive their income from the branch members.  The commonly understood use of the term &quot;levy&quot; refers to a levy of the particular branch membership.  Typically, levy funds are intended to assist members with educational grants or contributions to alleviate hardship, or otherwise to assist members as the trustees of such funds shall decide.  Within the union, there are a number of such levy funds bearing the name SIPTU in their title.  These are managed by the trustees of the relevant fund and for this reason are not included in the union's books and records.  The national health and local authority levy fund did not receive any money sourced by way of a levy on members and was not a &quot;levy fund&quot; within the understanding of the union, as I outlined.<\/p><p>  We first became aware of an issue relating to the SKILL programme when we were contacted by Health Service Executive audit personnel in September 2009 seeking a meeting.  The HSE was engaged in an audit and had been dealing with the administrator of the fund for some time on this issue.  At that time, the fund administrator was on sick leave following a serious accident in August 2009.  He had been engaged in the audit process until then.  Given the sense of urgency expressed by the HSE audit team, we immediately responded to the request.<\/p><p>  The HSE was seeking SIPTU's assistance in completing its audit.  At the meeting with the HSE, we were advised that grant payments had been paid into the national health and local authority levy fund.  This was the first time we had been informed that such grants were paid to the fund.  It was the HSE's assertion that the grants were meant for SIPTU.  We advised that no such money had been paid to SIPTU under the SKILL programme.  We presented copies of our annual audited accounts to Dr. Geraldine Smith who was leading the HSE audit when we first met.  We subsequently learned that moneys from several public bodies had been paid by way of annual grants and reimbursements to the fund over a number of years.<\/p><p>  The union's national trustees determined to inquire into the allegations surrounding the payments into the fund.  Two members of the trustee body were requested to carry out a thorough investigation with the assistance of professional advisers.  As members are aware, their report was published on 25 March 2011.  Much of the information was compiled by way of examination of bank records, return pay cheques and interviews with the fund administrator.  The report identified that the levy fund had been established in 1998 without approval or consent from the national officers or national executive council of the union.<\/p><p>  The trustees report considered the extent of knowledge which existed within SIPTU as to the operation and organisation of the training, seminars and travel which took place.  Apart from the fund administrator, those aware of the SKILL programme activities believed matters were arranged through the office of the project manager of the SKILL programme.  This was an office within the HSE.  We understood that all activities were approved and funded with the full knowledge of the Departments and agencies involved.  This is what we were told by the fund administrator when we asked about the sources of the moneys to which he had access.<\/p><p>  No grants were paid to SIPTU by the various State agencies or by way of the fund.  However, a number of transactions were made over the years between the fund and branches and other units of the union to the value of &euro;68,000 in total.  These were understood as transactions between the levy fund and union.  At no stage did any of the funding agencies directly contact SIPTU head office or pay SIPTU head office any grants.  As members know, the vast majority of the transactions associated with the account were captured by way of the copy bank statements we obtained going back as far as 2002.<\/p><p>  We thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for the professional manner in which they have compiled their report on this matter, the findings of which we accept.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reports total State funding of the national health and local authority levy fund of &euro;4.049 million and total lodgements to the fund of &euro;4.448 million.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report also found that between 2002 and 2010, the fund expenditure totalled &euro;3.854 million, while the net cost to taxpayers of the fund's operation was in the order of &euro;3.15 million.<\/p><p>  We know there was some concern expressed at this committee that our organisation was not co\u00adoperating fully with the Health Service Executive in its inquiries on this matter.  This was never the case and we gave every assistance we could by way of providing all information that was within our control, as we have done with the Comptroller and Auditor General's investigation.  It was SIPTU which proposed that the Comptroller and Auditor General investigate this matter.  As there were numerous public bodies involved, we took the view that the statutory powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General would be far more effective in securing the data necessary to complete a comprehensive report.  We assure the committee that we have co-operated fully with the Comptroller and Auditor General and have provided complete and open access to all data and records available to our organisation.<\/p><p>  Concern was expressed at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts held on 15 December 2011 surrounding two alleged payments of &euro;190,000.  We wrote to the Health Service Executive following that meeting seeking all documentation relating to the alleged payments but secured no evidence that they had ever been paid.  Arising from comment and speculation regarding these alleged payments, we referred this matter to the Garda fraud squad and met with it formally to outline our concerns.<\/p><p>  The inquiries and report of the Comptroller and Auditor General confirm reference in correspondence to such payments being approved in 2001 and 2002.  In fact, the payments were never made.  This money has not gone missing and is not unaccounted for, as the Comptroller and Auditor General confirms on page 10 of his report  It states:<blockquote>While records in respect of issues of public money and of receipts into the Fund account are incomplete for the years 1998 to 2001, the inspection team found no evidence of public money issued to the Fund in that period having been misappropriated. All sums of public money identified as having been issued by public bodies for the Fund in the period 2002 to 2009 were lodged to the Fund bank account.<\/blockquote>We can advise the committee that following the union's taking control of the fund and on foot of the trustees' report, we ensured that all public moneys remaining in the account were returned to the Exchequer.  The committee will note that almost &euro;1 million was returned overall by way of refunds to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>  There was responsibility on the part of the funding agencies to have service level agreements and proper oversight arrangements in place regarding the disbursement of public funds.  It is incomprehensible that these arrangements were not in place.  There was also responsibility on the fund administrator to keep proper books of accounts.<\/p> <p>No income and expenditure statements were compiled or requested by the funding agencies.  Unquestionably, there also should have been greater controls in our organisation in respect of the setting up of such funds and their oversight.  <\/p><p> We did not know the manner in which this account operated.  We should have known.  We have, as the committee will note from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, changed our rules in this regard and also had an external review of all our financial procedures to try to ensure that nothing like this ever occurs again.<\/p><p> Unfortunately the nature of the operation of the fund, in conjunction with the practices of the funding agencies, resulted in Departments and agencies effectively funding activities without proper oversight and accountability for taxpayer's money.  This was totally unacceptable and we note the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendations in this regard.  <\/p><p> There has been controversy surrounding the use of some of this fund in respect of travel, hospitality and the use of money for non-SKILLs associated expenditure.  Our organisation has never condoned the inappropriate use of public money.  We believe we must always strive to ensure the highest standards of governance and accountability on behalf of the taxpayer. <\/p><p> This has been a very difficult issue which has caused damage to our union and hurt to our members.  It is an event in our history that conflicts with the enormous positive contribution which our members have made in the development of a modern economy where rights are respected and the dignity of work is paramount.  It is unfortunate that the lack of proper controls and oversight regarding taxpayers money has tarnished such an excellent concept in respect of employee training and development.<\/p><p> Regrettably, a cloud has been cast over a very worthwhile programme, which has helped thousands of low skilled workers to up-skill and develop their talents and which has added real value to the provision of quality public services in the health and local authority sectors throughout the country.   <\/p><p> We believe the Comptroller and Auditor General's report has helped to verify the facts pertaining to SIPTU in this matter and we remain available to assist the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts in concluding its inquiries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000011#K00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Flynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371724200,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Joe O'Flynn.

Through the Chair, I suggest to Mr. Joe O'Flynn that this is a very serious issue concerning the fund.  It has caused a significant amount of disquiet among the public and in the committee because so many organisations are involved in what can only be described as a catastrophic breakdown in corporate governance.  Some of the things for which the account has been used are a vulgar abuse of public funds, for example, foreign trips, lavish hospitality, thousands of euro unaccounted for, inefficient use of other funds and a wanton disregard for the public interest.  How could somebody who is an employee of the union in such a high position have run this account with millions of euro going through it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000012#L00800","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371724200,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I have tried to explain how this occurred in my opening statement.  Clearly the use of the \"levy fund\" title was a distraction as levy funds do not come under either oversight or control of the union itself.  It is not captured in our accounts.  It is not subject to internal or external audit.  Clearly, the use of the title would have been an issue in respect of it not being identified as a fund of the union.  Second, I genuinely believe that the practices of the funding agencies, whereby they had no service level agreement, did not seek income and expenditure statements, and the fact that there was no oversight at any stage contributed significantly to what the Deputy said was usually inappropriate use of public moneys in respect of this programme.  Third, certainly it was our view throughout the entire period that the programme manager of the SKILL programme, who was a senior HSE employee, working out of the office for the SKILL programme was, at all times, overseeing and involved in the arrangements, the granting of the funding and so on.  As I said in my statement, when we inquired of the fund administrator on several occasions as to the source of the funding, as to the approval of the funding and so on, we were advised that all of this was, indeed, approved and funded by the SKILL programme.  We were told it had nothing to do with SIPTU, that the funding was for the projects which were part of the SKILL programme.  All of that combined, obviously it operated without our knowledge.  That is highly regrettable because had we been aware of such grants, which the HSE say were destined for SIPTU, we would have ensured that all of that money would, first of all, have been accounted for correctly and, secondly, spent for the purposes for which it was meant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000012#L00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1371724200,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Mr. Joe O'Flynn has mentioned that the levy fund is normally not associated with head office, that it is a fund into which branch members pay and is administered for branches.

We did not commission the Grant Thornton report.  In fact, we had nothing to do with it and could have taken the view that we did not want to see it.  Our position, however, was that we had two trustees, supported by a financial adviser, who were asked to inquire into all the assertions relating to SIPTU in this matter.  On the basis of several interviews with the administrator, bank statements and so on, the trustees compiled a report dated 25 March 2011.  That report was compiled in the absence of any records.  Being aware that a forensic report had been commissioned by the administrator from Grant Thornton and its legal people, we took the view that it was better to get sight of that report before our trustees completed their report, in order to verify the figures in terms of income, expenditure and so forth.<\/p> <p>There is a very important reason we did that and why - despite the fact it was a great deal of money - it gave us some degree of comfort.  The HSE was actually claiming that there were other amounts involved which were greater than those that were identified in the trustees' report.  It was really important for us that the integrity of our trustees' report would stand up to scrutiny.  As it has happened, the integrity of our trustees' report has stood up to scrutiny because the Comptroller and Auditor General, having spent over a year inquiring into all of the detail available, has effectively confirmed almost identical expenditure and income figures as those contained in the report.  From our perspective, there was value in securing sight of the Grant Thornton report.  It might have been an expensive decision but, nevertheless, I think it was the right one and I stand over it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000017#Q02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Flynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371727800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I am not questioning what Mr. O'Flynn said.

Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn claimed previously that in effect the HSE was spinning against SIPTU on the matter and that it might have been informed by other matters.  Who knows?  I am only speculating.  Was an effort being made by the HSE to deflect attention away from the fact that it was effectively financing this fund and it wanted to try to direct the heat somewhere else?  That said, it is clear that the manner in which the fund was administered was inappropriate.  It was unacceptable to anyone in this room and it is clear that it was not acceptable to Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn.  That is a matter of public record.  There were some bizarre and extraordinary practices.

Did someone - not necessarily someone senior or someone who was around the system at the time - begin to ask questions as to why there were no members with a significant levy account and a significant number of members with very little of a levy account?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000023#W03200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371730800,"counter":539,"content":"<p>There was no knowledge of the spending of the amounts about which we are talking here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000023#W03300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1371730800,"counter":540,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000023#W03400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371730800,"counter":541,"content":"<p>What there was-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000023#W03500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1371730800,"counter":542,"content":"<p>No, Mr. O'Flynn-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000023#W03600","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371730800,"counter":543,"content":"<p>Just let me explain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000023#W03700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1371730800,"counter":544,"content":"<p>In explaining I want Mr. O'Flynn to cover this ground.

Implementation of the report's recommendations will benefit not only the health services but the wider public service.  The report identifies a number of issues of general concern in the administration of grant funding by public bodies arising from the development and operation of the fund and presents a set of recommendations designed to improve the control over and accountability for State grants.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform accepts the recommendations and proposes to progress them in co-operation with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This will address the systems failures and weaknesses in governance which have been identified in the report.<\/p><p>  My predecessor, Mr. Michael Scanlon, the former Secretary General at the Department of Health, has already dealt comprehensively with the background matters of my Department's involvement in the funding of SKILL and partnership programmes, the question of foreign travel by departmental officials, the Ernst and Young value-for-money report and the SIPTU report.  For my own part, I acknowledge the deficiencies identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General and support strongly the recommendations for change.  On deficiencies in maintaining records of issues of public money and receipts into the fund for the years 1998 to 2001, it is a relief to note that the inspection team found no evidence of misappropriation of public money issued to the fund in the period.  The inspection team confirmed also that all sums of public money identified as having been issued by public bodies for the fund in the period 2002 to 2009 were lodged to the fund bank account.<\/p><p>  Prior to the establishment of a dedicated fund for the SKILL programme, the Department issued various funding sanctions for the training of support staff and for partnership initiatives involving the SIPTU health division.  This was against the background of a highly adversarial industrial relations climate, climates existing in the health service and considerable investment in the training and career progression of nurses, allied health professionals and non-consultant hospital doctors.  There was high level Government and ongoing ministerial support for these partnerships and training programmes and the various funding sanctions issued by the Department were informed by that support.  Partnership was Government policy and the national agreements and social partnership applied across the service.  Appropriate partnership structures and funding were put in place in the different parts of the public service.  Partnership was seen as an enabler of change and modernisation through the development of a shared vision of the service by management and staff.  The report refers to the governance framework for the SKILL programme developed by the HSE in consultation with the Department of Health in 2005 and signed off by the SKILL steering group in June that year.<\/p><p>  It is important that I acknowledge that the Department should have been more vigilant to ensure the governance framework was implemented.  While the framework might have been imperfect, its implementation in 2005 would have put the HSE in a position to deal with the issues relating to SKILL programme administrative expenditure which only surfaced in late 2009 as a result of its own internal audit.  The controversy surrounding payments to SIPTU should not detract from the merits of the SKILL programme itself which, notwithstanding the concerns expressed in the Ernst and Young report, has provided support staff with a solid training framework for career development leading in turn to improved services for patients by enhancing the skills of the health service workforce.  Approximately 8,600 staff have been trained under the programme.  The availability of the programme is particularly relevant today in the context of reducing other staff and other resources and the need to optimise the skills and effectiveness of the entire health service workforce to protect services to patients and clients.<\/p><p>  With regard to foreign travel, five serving and one retired departmental official participated in a total of ten overseas study visits between 2003 and 2009.  The officials who participated in those visits did so with the prior approval of their line managers.  The visits were relevant to problems being addressed within the Irish health service at the time and the joint management-union composition of delegations reflected the then-policy of developing and supporting a partnership approach to organisational change.  Full details of the study visits were furnished to the committee by my immediate predecessor.  I confirm to the committee that the Department has no knowledge whatever of the additional foreign travel identified in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report No. 80.  I welcome the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and will do my best to answer the committee's questions.<\/p><p>  Before I conclude I wish to add the following.  Mr. Matt Merrigan, the demoted SIPTU national industrial secretary, was a trustee of the SIPTU national health and local authority levy fund account.  All Department of Health officials dealing with Mr. Merrigan that I have interviewed did so on a bona fide basis in relation to both the levy fund account and broader health issues.  Department officials understood that the levy fund account was an official SIPTU account approved and sanctioned as appropriate by the national executive council or head of finance and administration of the union and, thereby, subject to SIPTU governance, transparency and accountability mechanisms.  The opening and operation of the levy fund account without the authorisation of the general officers or head of finance and administration of SIPTU is substantially a matter for SIPTU to address.  I add those points for clarification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000025#Z00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1371732000,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Can Dr. McLoughlin provide the committee with a copy of the issues he just raised for the purposes of this meeting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000025#Z00800","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371732000,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I am very happy to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000025#Z00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371732000,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend today.  I confirm that I concur fully with the Secretary General's opening statement.  In the interests of brevity, therefore, I do not propose to repeat any of the points that he has made.<\/p><p>  The HSE welcomes the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and his review of the financial records of the unauthorised account and, in particular, the additional transactions identified.  All of the audits conducted by HSE internal audit and the Comptroller and Auditor General between 2009 and 2013 identified serious breaches of HSE controls and regulations which resulted from significant control, governance and oversight deficiencies and the failure to adhere to existing controls and procedures rather than a lack of such controls and procedures.<\/p> <p>Following these audits, the HSE took immediate action to address these issues.  For example, the HSE subsumed both the SKILL programme and the health services national partnership forum, or HSNPF, within the HR directorate of the HSE, strengthened its foreign travel procedures, commissioned Mr. Turlough O'Sullivan to examine the overseas travel undertaken by HSE staff, engaged Ernst and Young to undertake a value for money review of the SKILL programme and took steps to ensure comprehensive compliance with its regulations on payments, travel and procurement.<\/p><p> Between 1998 and 2009, funds totalling &euro;3,383,536 were paid into the unauthorised account by the office for health management, or OHM, the SKILL programme and the HSNPF.  I have given a breakdown of the individual sums in the briefing note circulated to members.  To date, refunds totalling &euro;1,026,619 have been received from the five trade unions on foot of HSE audits.  This includes an additional &euro;27,618 recently received from two unions following the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The 18 additional trips recently identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General bring the total number of SKILL and partnership foreign trips undertaken between 1997 and 2009 to 74, of which 54 were arranged and paid for from the unauthorised account.  Of these, four were possibly paid for by SKILL or the OHM offices and 16 were arranged and paid for by the health service national partnership forum.<\/p><p> Many of the governance issues and controls weaknesses that emerged from the SKILL audit reports related to the fact that the SKILL programme had operated as a silo outside the HSE.  There was a lack of clarity and a great deal of confusion among various parties as to the programme's governance arrangements.  There was a lack of clarity in reporting relationships and lines of accountability.  The fund administrator of the unauthorised account was a key member of the SKILL steering committee who was allowed by SKILL management to have a close involvement in the executive function of the programme and SKILL management, and the office for health management did not query with the Department of Health the lack of terms and conditions for the award of significant grant funding to the unauthorised account.  The governance issues and controls weaknesses that emerged regarding the HSNPF payment of partnership moneys to the unauthorised account arose from the nature of the partnership operating model and the role played by the HSNPF joint chair who was also the fund administrator of the unauthorised bank account.  It is important to state that the current and former HSE managers interviewed by HSE internal audit confirmed that they were unaware that the SIPTU national health and local authority levy fund was an unauthorised account of the union.  They believed they were dealing with the fund administrator in his official capacity as a senior official of the union.<\/p><p> The HSE acknowledges that the issues identified by our own internal audits and by the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports on these matters represent significant and unprecedented failures in control and governance.  Such breaches were and are unacceptable to the HSE, which has moved very quickly to address the issues by implementing the extensive range of actions recommended by both internal audit and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  A clear message has issued to the system that such breaches of the HSE's governance and controls framework are completely unacceptable and will not be countenanced in any circumstances.  I commend the detailed investigative work conducted by the HSE's internal audit at the request of the HSE's national director for HR which uncovered these control breaches in the SKILL programme, the office for health management and the health service national partnership forum.  We are happy to respond as fully as we can to any questions the committee has.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000025#Z01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371732600,"counter":599,"content":"<p>May we publish both statements?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000026#AA00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371732600,"counter":600,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000026#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1371732600,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O'Brien, Dr. McLoughlin and their officials to the meeting and thank them for attending.  Mr. O'Brien and Dr. McLoughlin were not in place the last time the committee was asking questions on this topic.  I am interested in their perspective as new officials in the Department of Health and the HSE.  Having the Comptroller and Auditor General's report provides us with great finality.  We know the facts.  What we do not know is the motivation.  We had a very interesting session this morning with Mr. O'Flynn of SIPTU during which we went through the background to the deliberate establishment of the fund to, in my view and in all likelihood, avoid detection.  It was established in such a way as to ensure it would not come up on their audit accounts.  They would not have to see it and it could be kept quiet.  The Comptroller and Auditor General refers in his report to the setting up of the funding routes.  The report is very stark, stating:<blockquote><br \/>The complex routes used to channel public money to the fund created a risk that there would be confusion about responsibility for oversight and accountability for funding.<\/blockquote>We had money going from the OHM and the Department of Health to the Midlands Health Board, the national health partnership fund and to a levy account.  It was going all over the shop.  From the point of view of the health service provider, there was a complex, difficult to trace method of funding over which there was a lack of oversight.  On the union side, we had a fund which appeared to be set up ideally to prevent detection.  That cannot be a mere coincidence.  The facts are out there on lavish spending on foreign trips and hospitality, including a &euro;100,000 Beaumont Hospital trip which was considered useless by those who took part in it.  I find it hard to believe this inefficient and wasteful spending was a perfect storm of governance.  We are into something a bit stronger than that.  As two outsiders who were not present in the organisations at the time, do Mr. O'Brien and Dr. McLoughlin share that view or suspicion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000026#AA00400","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371732600,"counter":602,"content":"<p>The Comptroller and Auditor General has done the State some service, as has the committee, in dealing with the issue.

Clearly, there were industrial relations pressures.  Partnership was the way of doing business.  We have moved on a great deal and are in a different space.  Certainly, as Secretary General of the Department of Health right now, I assure the committee that we will learn the lessons from this and take firm effective action to ensure there is no recurrence of the issues.  There will be greater accountability and transparency within the system and we will work very closely with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Comptroller and Auditor General to learn the lessons and ensure they are applied.<\/p><p>  To be quite frank, I was a bit shocked at the extent of the file and very surprised at some elements of what happened.  Nevertheless, there were benefits there.  One has to be balanced.

In terms of the funding side, it was not entirely unusual for funding to be routed on a conduit basis for various projects - that is via one health board to a specific shared office, in this case the office for health management.  The overall governance arrangements and the lack of clarity on them created a context in which there was insufficient scrutiny of how the funds were then used and managed.  On the other side of the equation - and I do not want to impute motives because I have no evidence upon which to do so - the establishment of an account and the management of it by the most senior health sector official of a trade union bearing the name of that union and operated in the same branch as that union operated its corporate accounts clearly and could only give the impression that it was an official union account.  Why, therefore, it was not a union account is open to question.  In other words, what was the objective of giving the appearance of it being a union account when it was not?<\/p><p>  The overall view, however, is that all of the official objectives of this approach as set out in the original Labour Court recommendation could have been achieved much more satisfactorily in a much more streamlined way with effective governance and without the risk of misuse of public funds.

Documentary evidence for the sanctioning of funding is missing and there is a poor audit trail, which Dr. Smith has told us before.  It is not good enough to say it will not happen again.  If there are people currently involved in the administration of the health service, be it through the Health Service Executive, HSE, or the Department of Health, who were involved in this, had knowledge of it and were party to it, then we cannot let it go and claim it will not happen again.  There have to be sanctions.<\/p><p> Mr. Merrigan was demoted and eventually took early retirement.  There is a Garda investigation into his actions taking place.

I can see some advantages in checking in and visiting state-of-the-art facilities and ensuring evidence-based learning is available from other countries.  Certainly, I would be like Deputy Nolan in looking more to the UK or perhaps EU countries such as Finland but there are lessons to be learned from the US.  Many of the cutting-edge developments in health care come from the US, Canada and Australia.  There is no doubt that because of our relationships with those countries, there is much exchange of information.  There are good sides to that.  In the areas of pharmacology and pharmaceuticals, there are large benefits in terms of areas like medical devices.  The health system benefits from learning about how they do business in a better way in other jurisdictions so I would be strongly of the view that connections with the US, Canada and Australia are worthwhile.  Of course, we have technologies that enable us to do it online and there is a range of other methodologies for learning.

Normally in the course of an audit, a manager would be available to answer our questions and provide documentation.  We had nobody to answer our questions and the documentation was very sparse.

That was the point at which I contacted SIPTU, which was shocked that the account had existed without its knowledge.  Essentially, my correspondence with SIPTU consisted of questions.  The HSE's perspective is that it involved an individual operating in his capacity as senior SIPTU official.  All correspondence was from his office in Liberty Hall, on SIPTU headed paper and signed in his capacity as national industrial secretary.  Cheques from the office for health management, the SKILL programme, etc. were made out to the SIPTU national health and local authority levy fund.  From my perspective, it was a SIPTU account.  SIPTU has confirmed that it was unauthorised, which nobody could have anticipated.<\/p><p>  Following on from that, the HSE gave SIPTU every piece of documentation we came across.

However, now that both Mr. O'Brien and Dr. McLoughin are in situ, surely if there was this volume of travel today, they would find it peculiar and ask questions if 19 public officials were taking extensive foreign study trips.

They would arrange to be away from their offices for the trip.  They would turn up at the airport and the tickets would be there for them.  Essentially, the failure was the capacity for a large amount of money to be taken outside of the normal control environment into an environment that appeared to be controlled because of the way the account was set up.  I wish to clarify what I was indicating earlier was that I did not accept that there could have been nobody else in SIPTU, apart from the fund administrator, aware of this, but I was not questioning the corporate position of SIPTU, that it did not have control of the account.  The problem is that the appearance would have been created that it was official and that it was some control environment.  The important thing is that now the way in which any grant funds are processed precludes the possibility of them going off into this parallel universe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000032#GG02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1371736200,"counter":697,"content":"<p>That is a very fair submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000032#GG02900","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371736200,"counter":698,"content":"<p>I want to make it clear, for the purposes of clarity, that in respect of the officials named it is my understanding that their trips abroad were approved by the Secretary General of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000032#GG03000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1371736200,"counter":699,"content":"<p>I want to pick up on what Mr. O'Brien said about people getting a phone call.

When people went on the trips they did not think it was the SIPTU members who were funding it.

Witnesses can correct me if I am wrong.  Today, what we heard at the committee was SIPTU, on the one hand, telling us it believed matters were arranged through the office of project management at the SKILL programme, an office within the HSE.  SIPTU has said the HSE is spinning, leaking and not helping it to co-operate.  The way I read it is that SIPTU is pushing the blame firmly towards the HSE or the Department.  It is not SIPTU&rsquo;s fault; it is the fault of the HSE.  On the other hand, the HSE is saying the opposite.  I am trying to analyse the situation.  I am not pointing the finger.  I am saying what I heard.  The HSE is stoutly defending its position saying the process had SIPTU written all over it and it accepted the bona fides of the person concerned.  Nobody within either structure at a senior level has said there was something odd about the situation.  Nobody rang an alarm bell or checked with a line manager or someone else.  In spite of all that has been said, there does not seem to have been any real analysis of those that arrive back from the study visits imparting a great piece of knowledge to those with whom they worked to improve the relationship and make the grand change happen that we were all talking about at the time.  There was no accountability and much of the information that had to be found out was not discovered by the HSE, the Department or SIPTU, but by the investigations that were conducted and, ultimately, the investigation that was undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p><p>  We have a letter from Mr. Smith of which witnesses are probably not aware, which we will pass on.  We would appreciate comments on it.  Mr. Merrigan is retired and not willing or otherwise available to come forward.  A &euro;78,000 payment was made by the real SIPTU to Grant Thornton to view a report that the Comptroller and Auditor General, the country&rsquo;s accounting officer, cannot even see.  A large sum of taxpayers&rsquo; money is still under question.  The Committee of Public Accounts commenced an investigation and we have got to this stage.  It rests on the HSE, the Department of Health and SIPTU, in co-operation with the Comptroller and Auditor General and the members of the committee to bring the matter to a conclusion.  People will read reports on the issue and they will not believe that &euro;78,000 was paid for a sneaked look at the report.  It does not work like that.  There are questions to be answered.  We cannot sign off on the matter today, which we would normally do, as both Mr. O&rsquo;Brien and Dr. McLoughlin, know.  We are to have a private meeting next week at which we will discuss other matters and take legal advice.  In terms of the other witnesses which Deputy Nolan and Deputy Harris have mentioned as being of interest to the committee, we will just have to take it to that stage and ask where we go from here.<\/p><p>  That is not to blame anyone for non-co-operation or for not putting the facts before us.  Dr. Smith&rsquo;s original contribution to the committee was a complete eye-opener in terms of how she approached the issue, delivered the message and how accurate and concise she was.  It was refreshing to hear what she had to say at that time, even though it was bad news.  That is a general assessment of what went on and where we are.  Undoubtedly, we will have to find some way of closing off on the matter but we will not do that today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000033#HH00300","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371736800,"counter":703,"content":"<p>As Secretary General of the Department of Health I assure you, Chairman, that I will co-operate fully with the Comptroller and Auditor General.

Obviously, it is a significant issue and I appreciate where SIPTU are coming from on that.  Again, chronology is so important throughout all of this because I have been investigating this for the past four and a half years.  It is three years since we issued the original SIPTU report in June 2010, and throughout all of that there was no one bulk of records available.  This has all been gathered through bits and pieces.<\/p><p>  In relation to those two particular sums, the last day we were before the committee was December 2011.  Before that we were engaged in a process of trying to pull together funding expenditure from all sources, including Committee of Public Accounts transcripts.  That is where we came up with that document which the committee has.  As part of that I went to the Department and asked them to check their records and give me a list of all payments it has authorised to be paid to SIPTU, whether through the Office for Health Management, OHM, the SKILL programme or whoever.  That was around October 2011.  The Department came back with a list.  I went through that list comparing it against the various sources we had, including SIPTU's trustees report which they issued on 25 March 2011, and from that I identified that there were some sums, according to the Department, which were not in the SIPTU report or in any records I had been able to identify.  We went to SIPTU and explained the situation, namely, that the Department had identified these amounts and asking them if they could confirm that they were not in the account of SIPTU or real SIPTU, as the Chairman refers to it, and if they could check with the financial advisers of the trustee to see if they were in the unofficial account.  SIPTU came back and said it was not there.  I went back to the Department again and told them that SIPTU had said it had no sight of it.  I asked the Department to check its records again and give me any documentation it had on it.  The Department came back with a few documents. This was all happening in a very short space of time between October and December 2011.  They mainly centred around the &pound;150,000 which was authorised in, I believe, July 2001, and &euro;190,000, which was authorised in April 2002.<\/p><p>  In relation to the &pound;150,000 - July 2001 - there was a letter from the Department to, I believe, the general manager of the OHM, who was also the general manager latterly of SKILL, saying that the Department had approved &pound;410,000, part of which was for the front line, and asking if he could arrange to make the payments to Mr. Matt Merrigan, SIPTU.  We then see a letter from the general manager of OHM going back to the Department in August 2001 stating that he had made the arrangements to pay the said amounts to Mr. Matt Merrigan, SIPTU national industrial secretary, etc.  On that basis, why would an official say he has paid it if he has not paid it?  That was one part.  Regarding the &euro;190,000 in 2002, we have a letter from, I believe, the first Department official referred to, Mr. Frank Ahern, in 2002 saying that &euro;190,000 was approved.  I believe that was for the front line.  I would have to check the exact documentation.<\/p><p>  We went back to SIPTU and gave it all of that documentation.  Any paper we had we gave to SIPTU and told it that was the basis on which we were wondering if it had seen it or if it knew where it was.  SIPTU came back and said it was not there.  SIPTU took issue with my last evidence to the committee saying I had not said this was unofficial, and the committee would have seen the correspondence where I wrote back to SIPTU stating that at least three times during my deliberations and evidence to the committee I had clearly identified that SIPTU had not been able to identify it.<\/p><p>  To come to the point - where is it?  After the meeting, a lot of further tortuous work went on.  We had the OHM accounts and some bank statements.  I went through all of that to see if there were bulk amounts or if there was a cheque for &euro;190,000 or &pound;150,000 because until that point in all the investigations, any amount provided by the Department had always been paid out in bulk.  We had never seen it split.  I think it was reasonable to assume, therefore, that if the Department was providing &pound;150,000 or &euro;190,000, we should have seen a cheque.  We went through 3,000 OHM cheque stubs.  There were 12 cheque books to which we did not have access.  We went through all the statements, looked for these amounts but could not find them.  We then decided to see if there were smaller amounts.  I also identified that there were bank statements that we did not have and bank accounts that we did not know about.  There is no issue about them, I hasten to add.  We went to the bank and got the bank statements.  Altogether, OHM had about nine accounts.  We went through all of them and all the bank statements and identified what I would consider to be round sum amounts.  There were bank drafts so I went to the bank and looked for those amounts, again thinking that perhaps it had been split up.<\/p><p>  To cut a long story short, none of the cheques and bank drafts that came back were made out to SIPTU.  I went back to the records again and asked more people to look for records.  The bottom line is that of the &pound;150,000 the Department approved in July 2001, &pound;40,000 was paid by the OHM to the SIPTU national levy account in January of that year, &pound;25,000 of that amount was paid in August 2001, and I believe the remaining &pound;85,000 was retained by the OHM for its own purposes.  What has added to the confusion, I corresponded with the general manager of the OHM, latterly SKILL, in January and he told me that if the cheque for &pound;150,000 does not appear, it was probably never cashed but we now know there was no cheque for &pound;150,000.  I am satisfied that we have identified that.<\/p><p>  Regarding the &euro;190,000 for April 2002, we have been able to identify that &euro;90,000 of that was paid by the OHM to SIPTU - &euro;50,000 for a study visit and a &euro;40,000 levy.  That is the only information we have.<\/p> <p>The remaining &euro;100,000 actually was retained by the Office for Health Management, OHM, for its own purposes.  We subsequently found a letter to that effect from the general manager back to the Department.  Consequently, the mystery, <i>per se<\/i>, of those two amounts has been solved.  However, it has taken a long and winding path to get there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000034#JJ01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geraldine Smith","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371738000,"counter":721,"content":"<p>Those two separate amounts kept by the OHM were in its accounts.

We managed to identify and get hold of most of the audited accounts from the OHM and nowhere therein will one will see &euro;100,000.  I went back to the people I knew were doing the accounts for the OHM and went to Deloitte and asked them whether they had any records they could give us.

One point that is worth noting is that it was established in 1998 when a cheque issued from the OHM in the amount of &pound;25,000.  The bank account was established to receive that funding.  However, it is interesting that it was established with a title called the health and local authority levy fund account.  Clearly, it was anticipated at that stage that there might be funding from other sources or that it would be used for these purposes.  I wish to draw attention to this point, that there obviously was some understanding of this being used in the short or long term and that there might be funding from multiple sources.  I think what happened subsequently was that the amount of funding that was provided probably exceeded anyone's expectation and I do not really wish to speculate as to what were people's intentions.  One thing which I think is significant and which may be relevant is the amount of money that accumulated in the fund over the years.  A significant amount of the payments were made at year-end.  Had the payments not been made at year-end, they would have had to have been surrendered by the funding bodies.  Again, it probably is speculative to make this point but it may be that people felt they were doing good work in the partnership sphere and that they wanted to be able to continue that good work and to have the funding available.  However, it probably would be better if individuals who were involved in that kind of decision-making were asked to give an account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000035#KK00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1371738000,"counter":728,"content":"<p>Did the Office of Health Management give either the inspection team or the Comptroller and Auditor General any explanation for the reason its records disappeared?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000035#KK00900","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371738000,"counter":729,"content":"<p>The Office of Health Management no longer exists and has not existed since 2005, I think, with the establishment of the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000035#KK01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1371738000,"counter":730,"content":"<p>Does the HSE have any explanation as to the reason those documents disappeared?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000035#KK01100","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371738000,"counter":731,"content":"<p>No; they are unaccounted for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013062000035#KK01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1371738000,"counter":732,"content":"<p>I am slightly alarmed by the word \"disappeared\".

In adopting a cross-departmental approach and aligning our respective road maps, the determination shared across the board is for a robust framework that allows us to adopt appropriate measures within realistic, but ambitious, timelines.  We note that the explanatory note to head 4 states the national and sectoral low-carbon road maps are aimed at achieving transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy in a cost-effective way and as soon as possible, and not later than 2050.  From an energy policy perspective, our Department is mindful that sustainability and cost-effectiveness must be accompanied by paying due attention to energy security.  Adopting a national and integrated approach in close discussion with other Departments will facilitate the development of workable policy that is effective in terms of sustainability and energy security.<\/p><p>  It is important to recall the various 20s from the 20-20-20 EU plan.  While we are focusing today on the commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, the European Council and the directive are committed to increasing by 20% the energy efficiency in the Union and to reaching a target of 20% renewables in total energy consumption in the Union.  My Department is leading Ireland's delivery of these two other targets.  While we are facing many difficult challenges, we are making very steady progress and are on track to reach the goals.<\/p><p>  Reaching the energy efficiency goal and the renewable energy goal will make a significant contribution to the greenhouse gas emissions goal.  Energy policy in Ireland and most developed countries is founded on the three pillars of security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability.  More recently, as we consider updating our energy policy paper, we have been mindful of the opportunity that energy policy presents in terms of growth and jobs.  After the Presidency, we will turn our attention to the policy paper.  Members will notice a significant focus on the jobs and growth agenda, which has been uppermost in the Minister's mind and a major focus of the Government.<\/p><p>  It is important to understand the unique characteristics of our energy mix.  We are heavily dependent on imports of oil and gas from neighbouring markets.  Against that backdrop, our renewable energy capacity has continued to expand, with increasing use of wind power feeding into the grid.  Despite the difficult economic situation, reform and modernisation of the energy market has been steady, with implementation of an all-island electricity market, entry of new players into the competitive retail electricity and gas markets, and substantial investment in infrastructure.  Progressive liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets has been a positive move.<\/p><p>  I have already mentioned our proactive energy efficiency policy.  We wish to embrace the benefits of new energy technologies, particularly demand-side management tools on a smart grid tailored to suit our local circumstances.  Our efforts are aimed at making progress towards 2020 goals and anticipate even further greater ambition after that year.  Meeting ambitious objectives and balancing competing values will require considerable analysis and sound modelling at both national and European levels.<\/p><p>  As we face the end of an era based on fossil fuel and transition towards another based on establishing new energy systems, based on renewable energy and incorporating new technologies, we must employ sound data and evidence to develop accurate modelling scenarios that will enable us to make sound predictions on a more scientific basis across the range of sustainability, security and competitiveness.<\/p><p>  Head 5 of the Bill emphasises the need for due consideration to be given to the economic impacts of the national and sectoral road maps.  I am thankful that good work has been done on developing sustainability-focused models, but much more needs to be done to develop good quality predictors and models based on energy security and competitiveness.  We anticipate working closely with colleagues in other relevant Departments to ensure the full impacts of options for the sectoral road maps are clear.<\/p><p>  I will touch briefly on a number of recent developments in order to give the members some important background context to the Irish energy scene.  The in-depth country review of Ireland, conducted by the International Energy Agency in 2011 and reported on in July 2012, contained many positive comments on the direction being taken in the Irish energy market.  In its key recommendations, the agency urged actions to support the drive towards a low-carbon economy, including the development and deployment of new carbon technologies, in which Ireland has an advantage; ensuring that participation in regional energy markets brings benefits to our customers; and emphasising the balancing of local community concerns with the benefits of critical energy infrastructure.  It also recommended in its report that we outline a plan for emissions-reduction targets and that we update our position on developing low-carbon strategies and plans, which is why we are here today.  It recommended that we clarify the position on carbon tax and explore synergies between the energy and agricultural sectors so as to contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition, it identified a number of actions on continuing to strengthen our energy efficiency strategies and plans.  There is good alignment between the Bill and the recommendations of the International Energy Agency.<\/p><p>  Central to any future decarbonisation strategy will be the maximisation of energy efficiency opportunities, a point highlighted by the agency in its annual report entitled World Energy Outlook 2013.<\/p> <p>Unlocking the energy efficiency potential on an economically viable basis will remain a key focus of Irish energy policy.  Yesterday, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, launched the energy efficiency framework exemplar projects in DCU.  They will test new processes for procuring, contracting and financing energy, and carbon-saving projects.<\/p><p> The national renewable energy action plan, NREAP, sets out the Government's strategic approach to deliver on Ireland's target to achieve 16% of energy from renewable sources by 2020.  We aim to achieve 40% electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2020.  On the transport front, we are seeking to transform our oil dependency.  A two-pronged strategy has been put in place that combines significant increases in the use of bio-fuels with facilitating greater use of electric vehicles in Ireland.  The Government has also set a target of 12% renewable heat by 2020.  A series of related and complementary support programmes has already been put in place to address the delivery of this target, aimed at supporting both demand and supply sides.<\/p><p> Let me refer to the European Commission's Energy Roadmap 2050 and its Green Paper on a 2030 framework for climate and energy policies.  These important documents refer to the close linkages between climate and energy policy development and acknowledge the benefits of retaining a European approach to that policy after 2020.  Needless to say, the Department will ensure Irish interests are well represented in the development of a combined approach on target identification and delivery.  The work that we undertake on our sectoral roadmap will feed into our work on the 2030 framework.<\/p><p> I shall mention briefly some of the work that we undertook during our Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  The Minister chaired three Councils of energy Ministers, one being an informal meeting held at Dublin Castle.  Good progress was made on various legislative and other files, including excellent discussions on the 2030 framework and the need for renewed focus on facilitating energy efficiency.<\/p><p> Our Department is acutely aware of its responsibility as Ireland, Europe and the world transitions to a low-carbon economy and society.  We are seized of the challenges that such a transition presents across a number of fronts.  We must play our part in minimising the rise in global temperatures as much as possible.  We must achieve our long-term carbon ambitions without damaging our national competitiveness or undermining our energy security.  We are setting about our interrelated goals, within the legislative framework set by the Oireachtas, in collaboration with colleagues in other Irish Departments and agencies.  Our international colleagues, in Europe and beyond, are also focused on similar challenges and eager to engage, co-operate and succeed.  We look forward to addressing and overcoming the obstacles to a low-carbon future.<\/p><p> We are happy to answer any questions members may have concerning the Bill and the surrounding policy approach.  While we are not in a position to make an immediate response, we would be happy to provide follow-up information to the Members over the coming days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013062000004#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Spratt","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371735000,"counter":768,"content":"<p>I am thankful for the invitation to address the committee on the heads of the Bill.  I am accompanied by the following: Dr. Eugene Hendrick, a senior inspector with the forestry service who also deals with climate change, among other matters; Mr. John Muldowney, who provides the agri-scientific analysis to my division; and Ms Margaret Murray, head of the climate change section.<\/p><p>  The heads of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill provide for sectoral roadmaps to be developed that will, in turn, inform the development of a national low-carbon roadmap. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been requested to prepare such a sectoral roadmap for agriculture, and in this regard the Department has commenced its work.  As outlined, we will be liaising with colleagues in other Departments on cross-cutting issues.  The Minister welcomes the inclusion of the director of Teagasc as an <i>ex officio<\/i> member of the proposed expert advisory body to be established under the heads of the Bill.  The Department looks forward to working with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to see how it will pan out.<\/p><p>  While we understand that the principal focus of the first sectoral and national roadmaps is likely to be on the challenge facing Ireland in the more immediate term in meeting the 2020 targets, we are also conscious of the need to take a long-term view of how the agriculture sector will develop right out to 2050.<\/p><p>  In 2012, Teagasc prepared a detailed marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, study, which outlines its analysis for cost-effectively mitigating agriculture emissions to 2020.  In response to the recent NESC final report on the climate challenge, Teagasc has commenced a qualitative assessment of pathways towards a carbon-neutral agriculture sector by 2050.  Teagasc expects to have this work completed during the summer months, and this will be valuable in informing the Department's preparation of the first sectoral roadmap and the overall national roadmap.<\/p><p>  The heads list a number of important factors to be considered in developing the sectoral and national roadmaps, and these include: the need to promote sustainable development; the likely economic impact of a national or sectoral roadmap; the need to secure and safeguard the economic development and competitiveness of the State; and the need to take advantage of economic opportunities both within and outside the State.  As regards sustainability, the European Commission's joint research centre has found that Irish dairy production has the joint lowest carbon footprint in the EU, along with Austria.  The footprint of Irish beef is also below the EU average.<\/p><p>  The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has found that the temperate grassland production system, which is the predominant system of production in Ireland, is the most efficient type of food production system in the world.  A joined-up approach that features sustainable growth, allied to smarter, greener agricultural systems, is key to the continued expansion of the sector.  The benefits will include achieving economies of scale, lower carbon footprints on a per-unit-of-production basis, and progressive protection of the environment when the system is well managed and monitored.  The current Common Agricultural Policy negotiations are at a very sensitive stage.  The Department will utilise the new policy, particularly through the next national rural development programme, in order to help Irish farmers achieve the widest possible level of implementation and adoption of effective mitigation measures and thus improve efficiency even further.<\/p><p>  My division has supplied briefing notes to members.  They will see that the agriculture sector is extremely important to the Irish economy.  According to 2012 statistics, it provides 8% of total employment, 7.7% of GVA and 10.8% of exports, or &euro;9 billion in monetary terms.  Significant economic employment and rural development benefits continue to accrue to Ireland from the sector.  These are set to expand further with the rolling out of Food Harvest 2020, reform of the Common Agricultural Policy after 2013, the lifting of the milk quota restrictions in 2015 and the opening of new markets.  However, we need to be resourceful both to retain existing markets and open new ones.  Anything that can provide a competitive edge must be grasped with both hands.  The sustainability and carbon agendas are areas in which Ireland can do well by building on our natural advantages and agri-food strengths.<\/p><p>  In June 2012, Bord Bia launched Origin Green, a national sustainability development programme designed to help Ireland to become a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink.  It is intended that 75% of Irish food and drink exports will be sourced from companies participating in Origin Green before the end of 2014.  Some 254 Irish food and drink companies are already registered to participate in the programme.  This represents more than 70% of Ireland's existing food and drink exports.<\/p><p>  At farm level, since May 2011 over 43,000 participants in Bord Bia's beef quality assurance scheme have participated in a sustainability survey as part of their regular farm audit.  Ireland is the first country in the world to assess the footprint performance of farms on a national scale.  Similar programmes are planned for the dairy industry, poultry production at both farm and processing levels, and pigmeat and lamb production.  It is intended that all this work will be completed by the end of 2013.  Projects are also being planned for grain and horticulture.<\/p><p>  The 2009 effort-sharing decision included agriculture in the non-ETS category, and tasked Ireland with a very challenging 20% reduction target for the combined sectors of transport, energy, the built environment, waste and agriculture.  We must face up to the reality of this decision and try to reach the targets that were set.  However, it is vital that we continue to make the strong case both at EU and UN framework convention levels that there is inconsistency in this rather blunt approach to target-setting as far as agriculture is concerned when placed in the context of the worldwide demand for increased production of food.<\/p><p>  We have been working closely with the Department of the Environment to explain the particular nature of the Irish greenhouse gases profile to the Commission.<\/p> <p>As a result of this work, the Commission understands and acknowledges both the nature and carbon efficiency of the agriculture sector in Ireland as well as its economic and social importance.  The Department is finalising material for the Irish agriculture response to two recent European Commission documents.  These are the Commission's Green Paper, A 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy Policies, and The 2015 International Climate Change Agreement: Shaping international climate policy beyond 2020.  Our material will feed into the national response to both papers, which will be provided by our colleagues in the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government as the lead Department.<\/p><p> It makes no sense to set future targets that could lead to a reduction in production in an agriculture system recognised as one of the most efficient in the world.  Such an approach carries the very real risk of carbon leakage whereby production would be taken up by less sustainable systems in other parts of the world with consequent overall increases in global emissions.  A fundamental objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, is to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level which avoids dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.  Article 2 of the convention states that a stable level should be achieved within a timeframe sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change to ensure food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed sustainably.  Food security is clearly at the heart of the founding principles of the UNFCCC.  The human population is set to rise by an additional 2 billion to 9 billion by 2050.  The European Commission's 2015 staff working document on the Commission's discussion papers notes that by 2030 the population is set to increase to 8 billion and that it is expected that there will be a 50% increase in demand for food by that year.  The document indicates that agricultural productivity and production must continue to increase to feed the world's growing population.<\/p><p> All land use activities should be considered in the context of moving to a competitive low-carbon economy, including forestry.  Forestry is one of the very few sectors which demonstrates a significant capacity to achieve national emission reductions.  Forestry planting rights have a critical bearing on overall carbon neutrality through carbon sequestration.  In addition, the increased sustainable use of domestically harvested wood products and the use of wood fuels as an alternative to fossil fuels can also limit emissions and enhance the removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.  By the end of 2012, forest cover in Ireland stood at almost 760,000 ha, 11% of the total land area of the country.  In recent years, afforestation has been almost entirely carried out by the private sector with the support of State grant and premium schemes.  The most recent afforestation figures show that 6,653 ha were planted in 2011 while 6,652 ha were planted in 2012.  The majority of afforestation is carried out by farmers.  In 2011 and 2012, 94% of all new planting took place on land owned by farmers.  Just 6% of planting took place on land not owned by farmers.<\/p><p> The Department is contributing to a working group chaired by our colleagues in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to develop a national bio-energy strategy.  The work is expected to be completed during the summer.  In framing the strategy, consideration will be given to maximising the opportunities from within the agriculture and forestry sectors to contribute to the renewable energy targets for 2020 and beyond.  This includes the use of agricultural waste, energy crops and forest residues.  Ireland is to the forefront of research aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.  Internationally, the Department represents Ireland on the governing board of the joint programming initiative on agriculture, food security and climate change and the global research alliance on agricultural greenhouse gases.  Ireland is a founder member of the Global Research Alliance, the objective of which is to pool the resources of like-minded countries to enable the agriculture sector to continue to reduce emissions.  In 2012, Ireland became a founding partner of the new partnership on benchmarking and monitoring the environmental performance of livestock supply chains of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.<\/p><p> Since 2005, the Department has made awards totalling more than &euro;20 million on domestic climate change related projects.  Last November, &euro;2.7 million was allocated to projects on aspects of sustainability and climate change, including sustainable nitrogen use and sustainable ruminant production and life cycle analysis.  It is vital that the results of this research are put into practice at farm level to guarantee the supply of sustainable food into the future.  The Department has developed and funded schemes to incentivise farmers to learn about the best practices in farming.  These include the dairy efficiency programme and the beef and sheep technology action programmes.  Teagasc and other private advisers are key to providing an advisory service to farmers.<\/p><p> Ireland currently produces enough food to feed a human population of well in excess of 30 million people.  We export up to 85% of our agricultural output.  Irish farmers know very well that they are custodians of the Irish countryside for future generations.  Food production is at the heart of the global climate effort under the UNFCCC, and Irish agriculture is above all about sustainable production of food.  In national policy formulation, decisions should be informed by our well-earned world reputation and our proven performance as one of the most efficient food production countries.  The Irish agrifood sector must continue to produce more food more efficiently in carbon terms.  National climate policy should support and enhance that effort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013062000005#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul McKiernan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371735600,"counter":770,"content":"<p>I wish to speak to heads 3, 4, 7 and 17 of the Bill, which deal with the development of strategy, the link to international commitments and the preparation of a roadmap.  Clearly, the legislation is ambitious, which is necessary, and for many reasons it is expected to be particularly challenging for the transport sector.  I hope that putting that in the context of the heads of the Bill will be of some assistance.  On an important note, Ireland has achieved significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in recent years and is expected to comply with its reduction obligations under the Kyoto Protocol for the first commitment period, 2008 to 2012.  By 2011, emissions from the transport sector had fallen to levels 22% below the 2007 peak.  However, such reductions are due in large part to economic recession.  Emissions from transport in 2011 were more than double those in 1990.  By 2020, Ireland is required by the EU to reduce its emissions by 20% on 1990 levels.  Clearly, we cannot rely on continuing recession to meet our long-term carbon reduction requirements.  I hope that puts the challenge in context.<\/p><p>  Transport is a significant sector in the climate challenge context.  Emissions from the sector are almost 20% of the total.  Emissions from both transport and agriculture account for almost 52% of total emissions.  Significantly, transport and agriculture represent in excess of 70% of Ireland's emissions not accounted for under the emissions trading scheme.  Even with the achievement of the most ambitious reduction scenarios such as renewable fuel penetration and electric vehicle roll-out for the transport sector, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, estimates that transport and agricultural emissions could increase by 12% by 2020.  That represents the short-term challenge.  For the longer term, EU leaders have endorsed the objective of reducing Europe's greenhouse gas emissions by more than 80% by 2050.  In its 2011 White Paper on transport, the Commission set out a roadmap towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system.  The roadmap contains 40 concrete initiatives to be implemented over the next decade to allow for the building of a competitive transport system that will increase mobility and remove major barriers in key areas while supporting growth and employment in the sector.  The proposals aim to reduce dramatically Europe's dependence on imported oil in line with the wider goal of cutting carbon emissions by underpinning reductions of 60% in the transport sector by 2050.<\/p><p>  The Bill being considered today proposes to put in place a low carbon national roadmap for Ireland.  The roadmap, which is to be developed initially at sectoral level, will echo and be guided by EU initiatives, including those transport initiatives set out in the White Paper.  It will have to be tailored to the Irish context to achieve the 2050 objectives.  The sectoral roadmaps will also reflect existing domestic policy measures, which are already delivering considerable change.  Many of these domestic measures are cross-cutting in nature.  Transport accounts for one third of Ireland's energy requirement and energy related CO2 emissions, and it is vital we work closely with other key Departments represented before the joint committee today.<\/p> <p>The main difficulty for transport is its almost total dependency on oil.  Scarcity of oil and volatility in oil prices, along with environmental concerns, are acting as major catalysts in our drive towards efficiency combined with our search for viable alternatives to oil.<\/p><p> Advances in engine technology have provided significant dividends in fuel efficiency and, this, combined with a rebalancing of motor tax and VRT, vehicle registration tax, in 2008, has led to a major shift in the purchasing decisions of private car owners in Ireland.<\/p><p> Tax reform is very useful for incentivising the take-up of efficient technologies but regulation can also play a role.  A good example of such regulation is the bio-fuels obligation scheme.  The Government introduced a bio-fuels obligation to ensure a certain percentage of the transport fuel used in the State consists of bio-fuels.  Since 1 January 2013, the percentage of bio-fuels to be contained in transport fuel was increased from 4% to 6%.  It is expected that this scheme will be a key component in achieving a 10% penetration of renewable energy in transport by 2020.<\/p><p> Underpinning these measures is an overarching policy that seeks to develop a future-proofed sustainable transport system that serves the economic, societal and environmental needs of the country.  Existing measures being undertaken and supported by the Department span the aviation, land transport and maritime sectors.  They focus on encouraging smarter travel, on delivering alternative travel options and improving the overall efficiency of motorised transport in general.<\/p><p> In terms of smarter travel and alternative transport options, the long-term successes of the measures, while ongoing, will be very reliant on an integrated approach to transport and spatial planning.  My colleagues from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will be at the forefront of delivering such integration in developing a new national spatial strategy.  By creating compact, accessible urban environments, people will be in a better position to walk and cycle from home to avail of local education, employment and retail services.  We could also expect that people who are living in a better planned environment will be the ultimate beneficiaries of a more targeted and efficient public transport system.<\/p><p> The Department, with its agencies, is heavily involved in the promotion of more sustainable modes of transport through funding programmes that are delivering high-quality walking and cycling infrastructure across the country.  A key goal for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is to reduce overall travel demand and commuting distances travelled by private car and these types of programmes support that goal.  The foregoing are just some of the measures, initiatives and programmes under way and most will play some role in the development of a national low carbon roadmap.<\/p><p> In drawing up the roadmap, in line with the proposed legislation being discussed today, the Department intends launching an initial public consultation phase in the summer by seeking submissions to a thematic paper on key policy considerations in the transport sector.  Subsequent to this phase and consideration of submissions, the Department hopes to draw up an initial roadmap for consultation with other Departments, including those represented here today, later this year.  Any measures included in the roadmap would need to have regard to other Government policies, as well as any research or data that is available on the transport sector such as the report, Ireland and the Climate Change Challenge, prepared by the National Economic and Social Council.  Within the transport sphere, that report recognised the centrality of technology development, such as engine improvements, electric vehicles, gas-based vehicles and ICT, that could be exploited for the benefit of a more sustainable transport sector.  Of course, we will also look to Europe and beyond and consider where we could find synergies in developments as they occur across the EU.<\/p><p> Achieving sustainable transport will require a suite of actions that will have complementary impacts on travel demand and emissions.  This will be a challenging exercise but it is one that we are committed to undertake in co-operation with all key stakeholders and Departments to ensure we set out the necessary steps to achieving a low carbon future for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013062000006#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Fearon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371736200,"counter":772,"content":"<p>I thank the Departments&rsquo; staff for their presentations.  There is a commitment to increasing renewable energy sources by 20% by 2020 but there seems to be a drop off in reaching this target.

There are also restrictions on developing marginal lands that could hamper increasing production.  Renewable energy will take massive swathes of land.

We are working with our colleagues in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to keep an eye on what is happening there.  Regarding the Irish situation, we have grants available for the planting of biomass crops but, again, they are led by demand and, at the moment, demand from farmers to plant these crops is extremely low.  Therefore, we do not see much of a conflict as yet until it evolves a bit more.<\/p><p>  The EIA agriculture regulations place controls on how much land can be reclaimed, but there is only a strict limit on wetland that is always wet.  If one is reclaiming land for the first time, the limit on that is 0.1 hectare so, more or less, one cannot do it without planning permission.  After that, the threshold for drainage of existing agricultural land is 15 hectares, so it is quite high.  It is unlikely that we will see in the near future a farmer in the Irish context with an average of 35 hectares planting half of his farm and leaving land reclamation in half.<\/p><p>  Regarding Teagasc research, which was mentioned by Mr. McKiernan, the main research has been done.  Teagasc published the marginal abatement cost curve analysis last April, which fed into the NESC report, and looks at the main abatement measures available to farmers at the moment.  These range from extended grazing to better nutrient management to better genomic selection of dairy cow breeding.  They are all cost-beneficial measures.  The aim of the Teagasc advisory at the moment is to achieve a high adoption of those measures.<\/p><p>  Teagasc is trying to produce a scenario analysis regarding the possible roads available to Irish agriculture to achieve carbon neutrality.  It is looking at everything from reducing stock numbers to adoption of new technologies, including those that are too costly at the moment but which might become more cost-effective and blue-sky technology.  It is 37 years from now until 2050, so new technologies will come on stream, become more cost-effective and could be a solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013062000008#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Muldowney"},{"type":"speech","time":1371736800,"counter":778,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Fearon or Mr. Spratt like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013062000008#P00500","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371736800,"counter":779,"content":"<p>Deputy Stanley asked two questions about public transport and car usage.

That has been quite dramatic.  It has increased from about 12% in 2005 to over 90% now and has brought about a significant change.  Initiatives like those taxation measures and the carbon tax encourage that sort of shift.  In addition, what we are trying to do is to encourage people to look at alternatives for shorter journeys.  Much has been done in terms of mobility management, including encouraging large employers in particular to get staff to look at options they have in terms of their journey to work and encouraging people either to walk or cycle on shorter journeys.

It reflects a discussion we are having internally around this idea that we have done over 12% of the entire housing stock to include inconsistently occupied houses as well.  We are still getting a consistent level of applications so it is still well north of 300 applications per week.  It is just not at the level it was.  The discussion we are having internally is about how we move away from the early adopters to a more mainstream approach.  The programme for Government speaks very clearly about the transition from grants to sustainable financing mechanisms such as pay-as-you-save, so that is the work we are undertaking at the moment.  It is something with which we are grappling.  Undoubtedly, the economic environment has an influence to play.  Homeowners must still find most of the money upfront.

Obviously, we have been tasked with assisting in developing this legislation or least producing a report for the Minister.  It is quite important that we heard from the delegations so that we could have some insight into what these sectoral plans are likely to achieve.  I favour targets but that is a separate matter.  We have been told that our national ambition will be more or less demonstrated through the sectoral plans so that is why it is really important that we get this insight from the delegations.<\/p><p>  We all own this process and it is important we engage people as much as possible, not only in how we construct this but doing it in as public a way as possible.  If we are to go anywhere near meeting the targets, we will all have an input into making changes in the way people move, where they live and how industries like agriculture function.<\/p><p>  The targets to which we made commitments in 2020 are only one step and may change.  If they are going to change, they will change upwards so our ambition needs to be ambitious.  We were told by the EPA last April that, based on the current Government policy, there is no conceivable scenario whereby we will be able to meet the EU emissions targets based on a 20% reduction on the 2005 levels to 2020.  We already have a larger challenge and, each year, we have a challenge because the clock has not stopped ticking.<\/p><p>  Clearly, agriculture and transport are the major areas.<\/p> <p>Our economic ambitions for the food we produce conflict with the targets we have been set.  I accept that we have a good environment for producing food.  However, there is a conflict in meeting the targets while at the same time using food production as a major driver of economic growth.  We are trying to open markets in China and elsewhere.  I cannot see how we square that circle.  While I am aware that forestry is not included as a carbon sink, what counterbalancing measures could be implemented in the forestry sector and what should we do in that regard?<\/p><p> We recently met representatives of the NESC.  Rory O'Donnell raised a number of interesting points in regard to institutional arrangements.  Have the witnesses considered the different institutional arrangements to which he referred in order that we could have a robust mechanism for feedback from industry?  Perhaps it would be worthwhile sharing the NESC document with the witnesses for their consideration.  We need to find a way of delivering and if it is going to be an internal process among Departments without external engagement with the various sectors, I do not see how we can involve people to the extent necessary.<\/p><p> In regard to transport, none of us want a permanent recession but some of the decisions made recently, such as the change to carbon taxes, have in fact gone in the other direction of being less attractive.  We have been told that &euro;6 billion is to be invested in projects.  Will these projects be climate change proofed?  The Dublin interconnector will be a game changer in terms of moving people from their cars to public transport.  Are we likely to see that kind of ambition and will these initiatives be carbon proofed?  On the one hand we are asking people to leave their cars at home but on the other, subventions are being reduced for Bus &Eacute;ireann to service small rural areas.  I find it difficult to square that circle.  Regardless of how nice the legislation may look on paper, it will fail if it does not allow us to meet our obligations.  That is the litmus test for legislation.  It should be a vehicle to change people's attitudes and behaviour.<\/p><p> A considerable number of the people who signed up to energy saving schemes, such as retrofitting homes, had the money to match grants.  The difficulty we now face is in dealing with a cohort of people who do not have several thousand euro in matching funds.  It will be a task to design a scheme that gives people sufficient incentives to get involved.  I have on numerous occasions asked the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government about the progress made on these schemes because it appears to be taking a long time to move from one scheme to another where there has been a notable fall-off in numbers.<\/p><p> We speak about ambition in regard to sectoral targets but I am concerned that we are not moving very fast.  If we pick the right mix and make the right investments in meeting our targets for 2020, there could be a cumulative effect, but if we are dragging our feet at this stage, it is likely that we will run into difficulties as early as 2016.  Are the policy choices being made by the Government likely to conflict with our obligations?  What is the worst case scenario in terms of not meeting those obligations and what are the financial risks?  Nothing gets people's attention like the possibility they will be hit in their pockets.  If people realise the potentially serious impact of these obligations they may be more likely to change their habits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013062000008#P01100","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371737400,"counter":786,"content":"<p>Deputy Catherine Murphy raised a number of key issues in respect of transport and made an important point about legislation as the driver of change.

I suppose we, in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, were focused on renewable electricity and energy efficiency because we are mindful of how that can contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions.  As I mentioned in my opening address, we are also focused on post-2020 and what is the 2030 climate and energy framework and we are working in collaboration with the European Commission and other member states on what would be appropriate for us.  However, all of that must be based on sound modelling.  There is, in head 5, a provision which requires the sectoral roadmaps to have regard to the economic impacts and to really understand what are those economic impacts.  The last thing the Department would want is to deliver very ambitious options for the Minister to consider in the sectoral roadmap only for them to be accompanied by an expensive price tag which could impact on energy security and competitiveness.  While I accept that there is a need for urgency and we are seized of that, we need to get this right because of the potential impact on energy security and energy competitiveness.<\/p><p>  Deputy Murphy referred to the institutional arrangements proposed by Dr. Rory O'Donnell.  I would be delighted to digest those and come back to the Deputy with some thoughts on them.  On my Department's side also, she asked why is there the transition from grants to pay-as-you-save, and all the difficulties with that.

If we take a step back, PAYS as a concept is fine, but PAYS has never been implemented anywhere in the world to meet the parameters of the concept.  The project team is examining and testing those parameters and fundamental constructs.  They are going into the minutiae of how things stack up because PAYS works on the basis that this measure being installed will save one a certain amount of money, which one then uses to pay back the cost of installing that measure in the first instance.  Given the situation with our banks, it is a very complicated proposition.  It is a new way of lending, but it is lending and that is the challenge.<\/p><p> Deputy Catherine Murphy is correct; not everybody would be in a position to benefit from the programme.  With my other hat on, those in energy poverty are definitely not suitable candidates for a PAYS scheme.  They are excluded from the first round of consideration but there is a programme in place that targets them.  The better energy warmer homes programme has retrofitted 100,000 low-income houses.  That is how we will proceed in respect of that group.<\/p><p> The project team developing PAYS is working away, is very well advanced and has produced a number of documents.  It is undertaking a very different way of engaging with stakeholders for that project team.  All the documents are automatically sent to all stakeholders as soon as they are done, so the project team for a number of different documents receives them at the same time as everybody else and that is done very deliberately because the concept of PAYS will work only if everybody is pulling in the same direction.  While we have a project board that represents everybody in the industry and consumer association, it is still important we get the wider community on board, otherwise PAYS will never be a success.  The formal consultation process begins in July and then the project team aims to report back to the Minister at the end of August or the start of September.  The Minister will digest that and bring it to the Government soon afterwards.<\/p><p> Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned the risk of not meeting the target.  The energy efficiency target is an indicative target.  It is the only target that does not have a statutory obligation underpinning it, so there is no cost to Ireland.  However the energy efficiency directive introduced at the end of 2012 directs the Commission to review progress in 2014 and come back with options if it thinks member states will not hit that 20% target.  Under that directive all the member states have had to report back to the Commission in April to say what the national targets are, and that will inform that piece of work.  Ireland reiterated that we are committed to that 20% target and a 33% target for the public sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013062000010#R00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stjohn O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371738300,"counter":796,"content":"<p>Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned the recent EPA figures.

The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and all the stakeholders are aware that there is a real challenge for Irish agriculture to ensure that achieving the targets in FH2020 is done with the lowest possible carbon footprint.

However we envisage that forestry would be a significant part of the sectoral roadmap regarding sequestration and other benefits of forestry.  As we said in our opening statement, there are three aspects to the forestry component of climate change mitigation - sequestration, the trees growing and taking carbon out of the air; renewable energy, substituting biomass and forests for fossil fuels; and substitution of wood products for more energy-intensive materials.<\/p><p>  There is very significant use of wood biomass for energy generation in Ireland.  We estimate the forest harvest at approximately 3 million m cu. m per annum and approximately one third of that is used for energy generation.  That is mainly in the forest product sector itself, for process heating and so on, but there is a very large increase in the use of wood fuels both domestically and in other installations.  We estimate that wood use is saving approximately 300,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub> emissions per annum.  Otherwise that would be fossil fuel generated.<\/p><p>  The Department has a number of initiatives under way on the use of forest biomass as a substitute for fossil fuels.  Much of this material is small dimension thinnings coming from privately owned forest that were planted over the last 15 to 20 years and are coming into the management stage.  There is a forest road grant scheme geared towards first thinning that is helping mobilise this material into the energy sector and other end uses such as sawmills and board milling.  That scheme is in place under the current forestry schemes.  We are also funding research into the supply chain in the wood energy sector because that is a new area.  We have a very large project that is being carried out mainly at Waterford Institute of Technology that is examining the costing of harvesting wood fuels and how we can improve on that and become more cost competitive in that area.<\/p><p>  We also provide information to the sector via a website called <i>woodenergy.ie<\/i>.  I do not know whether the members are familiar with that but it is available to the public and offers advice to people in the supply chain on how best to source and use wood fuels.  Working with the Irish BioEnergy Association we provide grant aid to the wood fuel quality assurance scheme, which is geared towards companies that want to reach a certain standard in their supply of wood fuels that would give assurance to the public on the quality of their fuels.  We have a number of measures around the wood fuel area because we think it is an important area for future climate change mitigation.<\/p><p>  The private sector is one area where there will be an increase in supply of forest materials over the next 20 years.  We estimate that the current harvest of approximately 3 million m<sup>3<\/sup> will increase to 6 million m<sup>3<\/sup> by 2028 or 2029.  Most of that increase will come from the private sector and a significant proportion will go to the energy side.  It is important therefore that we have a good profile on the thinning of our private plantations and supplying it to the energy sector.  This will lead to benefits, not just for the energy sector but for the wider forest sector in terms of material that will flow into sawmills and boardmills, because if one thins the plantations the trees grow to larger sizes.  It is an integrated policy on the management of our forests regarding energy supply.<\/p><p>  We will examine the sequestration side regarding the sectoral road map and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Because we have a young private forest sector that has been established in the last 20 years, this is taking much carbon out of the atmosphere.  That will be an important element regarding the Department's sectoral plan.<\/p><p>  The wood products aspect is important because substituting wood for other materials is an important long-term goal and we are working through the timber standards consultative committee of the National Standards Authority of Ireland on wood standards, putting in place various improvements in standards which would help to encourage the use of wood as a long-term replacement for energy-intensive materials.<\/p> <p>We have the EPA figures and Teagasc also has its own projections.  It should be borne in mind that some of them are pre-abatement.  Teagasc has identified that there is abatement potential of up to 1.1 megatonnes, provided the most efficient practices are adopted but that needs more engagement by farmers to use these practices, which are not just environmentally effective but also economically effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013062000011#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Hendrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371738900,"counter":799,"content":"<p>Teagasc, through its MAC curve, has identified a number of abatement options that would potentially yield 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 savings from agriculture.  The question for us is achieving that abatement potential from agriculture.  That is critical and we will try to avail of our advisory service through Teagasc and private planners to ensure better uptake by farmers of these technologies.<\/p><p>  In terms of raising awareness among farmers, Bord Bia, through its carbon navigator and quality assurance scheme has more than 40,000 beef farmers involved and it is linking this back to make the farmer believe this is important for the green credentials of the produce he is selling.  We are working from every angle to encourage the adoption of the navigator by farmers.<\/p><p>  Teagasc has done a great deal of research to come up with this abatement.  The Department is heavily engaged in providing research funding to both Teagasc and universities to increase our understanding of the mitigation potential available in agriculture.  One of the larger projects we have engaged in is the greenhouse gas network, which is trying to look at carbon and nitrous oxide pools in soil to better understand what is happening there, with a view to try to account for the carbon sinks in the permanent grassland, which extends over 3.6 million hectares.  This is part of the long-term view and, hopefully, that will help to feed into the recent decision at European level on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry, LULUCF, accounting and a mechanism for that.<\/p><p>  We visited Bonn as the beginning of June and were heavily engaged from the agriculture point of view in trying to prepare for where the accounting system and discussions on agriculture can potentially go.  We were lucky enough to get a decision on agriculture at the scientific body in the international negotiations in the second week of June.  We are pleased with that.  That will look at adaptation in agriculture and adaptation co-benefits and that will include mitigation.  It is again about trying to look at a long-term goal.  All parties subject to the UNFCCC are asked to submit ideas on where they think adaptation in agriculture and adaptation co-benefits could go.  We will be interested in looking at that.<\/p><p>  One of the issues that delayed progress on agriculture at the international level is many countries are concerned that agriculture will be relegated to a mitigation option and food security is not something they want to sacrifice just for mitigation.  Some of the larger countries have under-nourished populations and if Ireland reduced food production because it would achieve the goal for us, it would be detrimental to the populations in these less developed countries.  They are worried about that and that is why the focus is on adaptation and the importance of agriculture in the communities of these countries.  There is an important social dimension to that.

There is no interest on the part of farmers in going down the route of energy crops required for bio-fuels and, therefore, they are deciding that pasture land and so on is a priority.  Considering our targets for the use of bio-fuels and where we get the necessary crops from, that means we will have to go outside the jurisdiction.  How far do we go?  At that point, we are increasing our carbon footprint by importing such crops to blend bio-fuels.<\/p><p>  In east Africa, people who were growing food crops through coercion on the part of authorities or for whatever reason are now growing energy crops but that means they are not being fed.  Are we going to pursue our bio-fuel targets without due regard to that issue?  In addition, those crops are being transported to Europe.  Has cognisance been taken of that issue, which has been raised by aid and voluntary organisations abroad who witness on the ground the devastation being created by us pursuing that policy?<\/p><p>  The transport sector is the most challenging.  While I welcome the improvements in public transport, provision is not a reality in rural Ireland.  While the main improvements in rural Ireland have been east-west or to the main centres of population, those journeys can still be a considerable distance, people would have a diminished lifestyle if they did not get into a car because of the poor public transport system.  Cycling is impossible and the other initiatives being pursued will have a limited impact on people sitting into their cars.  The problem with the use of oil, particularly for transport, bearing in mind the cost of batteries and the lack of confidence in the distances to be travelled in rural Ireland, will not be overcome unless there is a realistic alternative when one goes to a forecourt to fill up.  That is why I am interested in gas-based vehicles as at least an interim measure.  I understand that in the US there are proponents of a device that can be fitted on any vehicle for &euro;100 to allow it to be modified to use either fuel.  Is that being considered to be made mandatory in the State or has it been examined to give people an alternative?<\/p><p>  As we strive to reduce carbon emissions, we are going to diminish people's quality of life, particularly in lower socioeconomic groups, who find they have to pay carbon taxes but they have no public transport alternative or they cannot afford to change their heating system.

We need to be a little careful before we rush into this because it might not be that simple for people in living in certain areas of the country.<\/p><p>  With regard to abatement in the agriculture industry, I have followed the issue of anaerobic digestion for ten years but nothing has happened in this regard, particularly in the use of animal slurry.  The benefits of addressing this is that the slurry would not be left in a tank stewing and pumping carbon into the atmosphere. <\/p> <p>There are many other environmental benefits arising out of it, such as lessening by a considerable degree the chance of polluting water courses.  There are thousands of plants for anaerobic digestion all over Europe, particularly in Austria and Germany.  What is this country doing and what is the Department doing in respect of making this possible, because it is possible in other countries?  If one can take a potentially harmful product, turn it into methane or bio-gas and be left with another by-product called a digestate that one can spread on the land and that has similar properties to bag fertiliser when it comes to fertilising land, surely we need to move in that direction.  I am sure the Department is aware of the facility in Callan on the Tipperary-Kilkenny border where this is practised.  It has not spread and I suggest that one of the reasons it has not spread is because people are a bit paranoid about waste management facilities being beside them.  Given that the technology is proven and we do not need to pilot it anymore, has the Department considered going down the route of getting communities to do it themselves in a co-operative sense?  This way, they do not see an advertisement in the paper telling them that an anaerobic digester is on the way; one week later, that an incinerator is on the way; and another week later, that something even worse is on the way.  Has the Department looked at this because there is a massive resource there?  When I looked at it originally, I found that something like one million tonnes of cow slurry are produced in County Roscommon every year.  The potential for environmental damage and the loss of the potential for bio-gas is massive.  What are the Department's plans in this regard?<\/p><p> I am loth to use the term \"waste management\" because it is a disgusting term.  It should be renamed \"resource management\" because nothing is waste at this stage.  We can reuse it.  It is a debate that has become completely silent among politicians.  I do not know whether it was debated more than ten years ago because powers were being taken off politicians in respect of the issue.  Now that we seem to have got over the fact that we have lost those powers, we do not discuss it anymore.  When it comes to climate change, one of the most important things is how we use our resources and the energy that goes into them.  From the perspective of incinerators versus mechanical biological treatment, it seems we are going down the incinerator route.  How does that fit with us reducing our carbon emissions?  I know people will say it is better than landfill.  Of course it is because anything is better than landfill.  That was not even a technology.  It was the technology of a dog burying his own dirt.  What are the plans for that area?  Some people will say it is better to put it in an incinerator and burn it to get energy rather than put it in landfill and get nothing out of it.  One would get energy if one burned &euro;100 bills as well but it is not a good enough argument to say we should burn them because we would get energy out of them.  What is the Department's thinking on this because incineration is not sustainable?  I will not go into the health aspect of it but from the point of climate change, incineration does not make sense.  Incineration is based on the idea that there are infinite resources that we can keep burning, that they will go away and that we will pretend they do not exist anymore.<\/p><p> Perhaps somebody here could establish what a carbon tax is about because I was of the opinion that a carbon tax was something imposed on society and the money raised out of it was used to change habits.  In other words, the money would be ring-fenced for public transport subsidisation and used to fund the transformation of houses into passive, carbon neutral houses.  In the past month, I was involved in an argument with a member of the Green Party who told me that this money, remarkably, is for education, hospitals, etc.  Perhaps I have got it wrong.  What is the carbon tax for?  If it is what I think it is, it is a very good idea in that while one is putting an extra financial burden on people, at the other end of the scale, their houses become less expensive to heat and it becomes less expensive to travel on public transport so it turns out to be revenue neutral for people.  However, it appears this is not the case.  It seems - I could be wrong - that the carbon tax is being used as another way to gather revenue to pay back our massive debts.<\/p><p> I have a suggestion in respect of the payment of the fuel allowance.  At the moment, people in receipt of the allowance get it on a drip-drip basis, week by week.  Could the Department look at giving it in a lump sum so that people could insulate their lofts and heat their houses for much less and there would be more gains the following year?  I also picked up on the idea that we must all live very closely together.  There appears to be a philosophy among environmentalists that we must all get out of the countryside because to get there requires energy and damages the planet so we should all stay away from the country and live in nice, compact units.  That will be a massive struggle because we do not want to do that so one will have a big job changing that.<\/p><p> I am sure Dr. O'Connor knows this area inside out but something he said chimed negatively with me.  What he said suggested that a considerable amount of box ticking is taking place.  When a question was asked about what might happen if we do not reach our targets, Dr. O'Connor said there would be no cost to Ireland if we do not reach them.  Is it about giving the impression that we are doing the right thing or is it about actually doing the right thing?  Ultimately, it will be a cost to Ireland.  Is it just the cost of looking bad or of not ticking a particular box about which we are worried?  The philosophy should be that we should not have to be forced to do this.  If we are going to do it and do it successfully, we must willingly do it ourselves.  If we are going to do it on the basis that Europe or someone else makes us do it, we are less likely to do it.  The best opportunity for success is for us to want to do it, for us and the Department to create the environment where it is easy for people to do it and where there is more of a focus on the idea of resources and not wasting resources.  I fear that environmentalism is a dirty word, which is sad given that we have only one environment in which to live.  I hope the Department will go about changing that attitude.  There are ways to do that.  That is my tuppence worth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013062000012#T00400","speaker":"1084","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371739500,"counter":803,"content":"<p>Environmentalism is not and should not be a dirty word.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013062000013#U00400","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1371739500,"counter":804,"content":"<p>I agree that it should not be but it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013062000013#U00500","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1371739500,"counter":805,"content":"<p>It is not a dirty word for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013062000013#U00600","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1371739500,"counter":806,"content":"<p>Nor me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013062000013#U00700","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1371739500,"counter":807,"content":"<p>We are sitting beside each other, this is the Oireachtas environment committee and we are all here to discuss the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill.

For example, why should Ireland be penalised if a particular country does not meet its targets?  In my view, we would be being penalised for being too good.  One must balance the argument of targets against what works in a particular country.  There is a need for further dialogue around the targets issue versus what and how we are doing, if it is working and if we are going to continue to penalise ourselves by setting extreme targets in a particular area while another country makes no attempt to achieve its targets.

How, given one cannot modify methane gas emissions from cows, is it proposed to make cows carbon neutral?  We are doing well in the area of wood to energy.  Given current planning exemptions in respect of the construction of 40 ft extensions many people are now installing solid fuel burning stoves.  Planning regulations have not yet caught up with the mass of fuel burning.

I would welcome a comment from the delegates on the implications for Ireland of not meeting the changes to the energy efficiency directive.

On Deputy Mulherin's question in regard to indirect land use change and concerns around land use change from food to bio-fuel crop production, this is a matter dear to the heart of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, in particular as he chaired the Council of the European Union.  It is an issue that arose throughout the Presidency.  Given that Ireland was chairing the Presidency it had to take a neutral and a facilitative approach.  However, the Minister has arranged for a UN expert to address the energy working group this week to ensure that the message of the impact of this gets through not only to the attach&eacute;s but to the permanent representatives in Brussels.  We will be wrapping up with a progress report on that particular legislative file.  It has been a difficult issue.  The matter raised by Deputy Mulherin has been to the fore of all Ministers' minds.<\/p><p>  As things stand, some member states have invested heavily in infrastructure which would assist in the use of primary bio-fuels.  The proposal is that this would be limited to 5% of the 10% target.  In other words, only 5% from primary fuels would be allowed and there would be a greater focus on secondary bio-fuels, including from waste, straw and so on.  It is hoped we have been able to steer this in a way that will address the concerns expressed by the Deputy and the Ministers at the Council of Ministers meeting.<\/p><p>  On the fuel allowance, Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan suggested that a lump sum rather than drip by drip approach be taken in this regard.  That is something that could come into the mix in discussions with the Department of Social Protection.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, is very interested in teasing out with the Minister for Social Protection if there are better ways of spending the money currently being spent on the fuel allowance in order to facilitate greater energy efficiency.  We have opened up dialogue in this regard with the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>  Mr. Brian Carroll, who heads up our renewable energy division, will address the question about incentivisation of anaerobic digestion, which was raised by Deputy Luke 'Ming Flanagan and others.

We already have in place the tariff support scheme, REFIT 3, the aim of which is incentivise an additional 310 megawatts of renewable electricity biomass capacity to the Irish grid, some 200 megawatts of which will be in anaerobic digestion and solid biomass.

On Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan's question, I may have misspoken in that there is no financial penalty for non-compliance.  The Deputy is correct that there is a huge economic benefit for us to deliver the 20% efficiency.  Energy efficiency makes sense.  It is the primary priority of all energy policy.  From a competitiveness perspective, it is key.  The Energy Efficiency Action Plan includes figures on what it would mean to Ireland Inc if we were to deliver the 20% target.  I do not know those figures off the top of my head but will ensure a copy of the plan is forwarded to the committee.<\/p> <p> Deputy Michelle Mulherin had a point about the single payment, which is an issue.  Mr. Spratt has mentioned that the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, is having that discussion.  From our perspective, we are examining technological solutions that may overcome the hurdle of a single payment to buy fuel.  There were some interesting programmes that we funded via the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and these have been pay-as-you-go oil solutions, which are interesting.  It takes the need for a fill of oil from the home owner and people are only paying for what they use.  It is like topping up mobile phone credit and is a really interesting solution.  Problems are being worked out.  We funded a pilot project last year in Northern Ireland and are funding a greater pilot project this year.  I have high hopes we can overcome the barrier on the single payment and moving to a pay-as-you-go option in the oil sector, which is a much better solution that allows people to manage consumption much better than a single payment.  It is an interesting area on which I am happy to make more details available if members so wish.<\/p><p> The energy efficiency directive was mentioned and I am happy to say I will be attending on Saturday.  The energy efficiency directive covers a multitude of issues, the most relevant being that national renovation strategies must be put in place, as well as obligations on energy suppliers - the main part of the energy efficiency directive, with everything else wrapped around this.  <\/p><p> I have also mentioned energy performance contracting.  Yesterday we launched the exemplar projects that will test a new energy performance contract and framework.  That work will be ongoing in the next couple of years.  Effectively, we are producing national handbook on different ways of procurement.  We are already well ahead of the game in that respect.  There is another issue concerning combined heat and power, CHP, systems and ensuring they are taken into the generation mix.<\/p><p> I will focus on Article 7 as being key.  It puts large targets on energy suppliers to deliver energy efficiencies.  It is small but complicated and the interpretive note runs to 60 pages.  We are considering it because we have 19 energy suppliers signed up to energy saving voluntary agreements covering electricity, gas, solid fuels and oil.  This is one of the only countries in the world with that mix taken into account.  The issue for us is whether the existing scene should continue or migrate to something new after 2013.  That issue is before the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013062000014#V00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stjohn O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371740700,"counter":815,"content":"<p>I had a question written down, but I may have forgotten to ask it.

The Deputy mentioned the issue of having a realistic alternative, on which we must continue to work.  The possibility of having gas-based vehicles has been recognised and recommended by the National Economic and Social Council, as well as the concept of working towards the use of alternative fuels, either through decreasing the amount of traditional fuels or encouraging people, where possible, to use vegetable-based fuel, etc. where engines can cope.  There are no proposals to make this mandatory, but we are conscious of the matter.<\/p><p>  With regard to legislation, the Deputy mentioned being conscious of the impact on ordinary people.  That strikes home in the transport sector.  In the initial presentation I tried to outline the scope of the challenge.  In trying to meet it there is no single identifiable solution.  Therefore, there will be an impact on a great number of people in many areas, of which we should be conscious.  That is why the concept of consultation and setting out the complete programme will be very important in the coming months.<\/p><p>  Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan mentioned the carbon tax and how it was used.  From our perspective, the benefit we see is in how the taxation influences behaviour.  Whether it is used to reinforce this in specific ways is another consideration.  The use of the taxation regime to influence what people do has been important to date and will be a very important tool available to us in the future.<\/p><p>  I was taken by the comment that not everybody wanted to live too close to others.  That puts the finger on the particular difficulty, as what is set out in the Bill in the case of transport and other sectors is very ambitious.  It will simply not be possible to get there through measures that are both popular and low-cost.<\/p> <p>The package employed to reach the targets that are envisaged must encompass a very wide range of measures.<\/p><p> With regard to transport, an efficient public transport system would greatly encourage people to live in more densely populated communities but it is not a solution for everybody.  We must introduce a suite of measures that will help us reach our targets.  We also hope that the move towards low-carbon living will be an opportunity to create a niche market that will drive employment and create other benefits.  Such initiatives have been recognised at a European level and it is important that we do not lose sight of it here.  The level of change is very significant and the costs associated with the transition are not insignificant.  Therefore, we must look beyond environmental benefits and at other benefits that will arise. <\/p><p> Senator Keane mentioned transport priorities.  In response, my colleague spoke about alternative energy and how to boost the use of electric cars.  I wish to touch on the point made by Deputy Mulherin who said that providing transport infrastructure for the majority of people would make public transport attractive.  She also wanted to know how we can make the greatest impact.  We can create benefits quickly by concentrating on areas like large fleets or employers.  <\/p><p> A point was made about gas-based vehicles.  There would be cross-sectoral benefits if people used gas generated by anaerobic digestion.  One of the transport sectors that we have examined, and will continue to focus on, is changing the way people travel for short journeys and I acknowledge that it is not a solution in rural areas.  People living in urban areas undertake a phenomenal number of short journeys by car.  We have put a lot of effort into trying to induce people to change the number of their short car journeys.  We will continue that focus by promoting walking and cycling schemes.  We can make a difference if a great number of people change the way they travel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013062000015#W00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Fearon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371741300,"counter":821,"content":"<p>Deputy Mulherin made the point that there can be unintended consequences when people grow energy crops instead of food crops.

That led to a situation similar to what Deputy Mulherin described, namely environmentally friendly fuel turning out not to be kind to the environment.  In other words, the EU proximity principle was completely ignored because more fuel was used up transporting feed stock, waste or resources to an anaerobic digester than was produced.  I am a fan of anaerobic digestion and it would be brilliant to build a digester beside the prison in my town but it will be hard to persuade people that the process is safe.

We do not have grid coverage where we are best resourced.  This is a problem for those who are trying to pursue the development of wind farms.  I am familiar with a number of cases in County Mayo wherein the grid's slow pace of development has affected their financial viability.

The CES has recently done some work in this area and prepared a report which contains several recommendations for the upcoming European elections which will be held at the end of May next year.  One of the suggestions is for transnational lists of candidates for the European Parliament and that the biggest political parties should declare their candidate for Commission President before the upcoming elections.  Other bodies are suggesting this, too.<\/p><p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000003#B00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371722400,"counter":843,"content":"<p>It is not only an honour but also a pleasure to be here.  I thank the joint committee for inviting me to talk about the future of the European Union and will be brief.  That is usually a vague promise, but I will try to be serious about it today.  <\/p><p>  I understand that when talking about the euro crisis as a point of departure here, there is a prize for all foreigners who do not start by quoting W. B. Yeats's line, &quot;Things fall apart,&quot; to describe the situation.  We have made some good progress in the past few couple of years and are on our way collectively in the European Union to working our way out of it.<\/p><p>  I will present the key theses of the policy brief of the Centre for European Studies which begins by addressing the necessary steps in Economic and Monetary Union and derives from it a couple of proposals on political union, especially in addressing the question of democratic legitimacy.  If we assume that what we want to achieve in the long run is economic convergence and the reduction of economic imbalances between the eurozone economies and if we want to achieve debt sustainability and a more sustainable banking system, we need not only better policy co-ordination but also the power to overrule national decisions in some cases by the European institutions and probably the Commission.  However, there are several possibilities which include not just overruling in the sense of making legislation or budgets impossible but possibly also financial sanctions through the mechanisms of financial solidarity.  One needs an orderly default mechanism and, probably in the long run, some debt mutualisation.  I know that is a dangerous notion for some member states, including my home country, Germany.  In the long run in what we propose this is probably unavoidable in a currency union.  Of course, we need the completion of the Single Market and further moves towards greater competitiveness, but I am not going to talk about that issue.<\/p><p>  What we will have is a more politicised and, therefore, more politically legitimate European Union.  We have behind us 60 years of a widening and deepening European integration process.  In a functionalist logic that means taking small steps incrementally, increasing the scope and depth of the integration process and a system of governance according to the Rome treaties which created the system with a Commission, a European Council of Ministers and the Parliament, a system of government which is unique, <i>sui generis<\/i>.  If we want to come to a political union with more democratic legitimacy, we will have to tackle the very system that was created in the treaties of Rome.  In other words, we will have to address the treaties of Rome and their basic ideas and that would be the most fundamental change in the set-up of European integration since the 1950s.  We want to increase citizens' ownership of decisions taken at European level.  That means giving the right of legal initiative to the European Parliament also, not only to the Commission as is the case now.  The European Parliament, in turn, would have a role in the formulation of economic policy which is now only the Council's prerogative.  We would have to increase the turnout at European elections, which has been decreasing steadily since 1979, when it was 62% for the first direct elections to the European Parliament, down to 43% in the last European elections in 2009.  We need to reverse this trend if we want to increase citizens' ownership.<\/p> <p>The role of the Commission as an independent body that represents some kind of abstract community interest, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the member states and political forces, will probably have to change.  In other words, the Commission will have to be politicised.  There will be more party political play within the European Commission.  The Council President will also have to have his or her democratic legitimacy increased, possibly through direct election, and national parliaments will have to be better involved in European politics.<\/p><p> In the short term our idea is what we call the strategy of the three Ps.  The first is to politicise, in the sense of political parties, the European Parliament.  It is not as party political as national parliaments.  The second is to polarise, in other words, to have much clearer policy alternatives in the European Parliament.  The third is personalise, that is, to put human faces to the different political options.  To politicise in our sense means to give a stronger role to the European parties. <\/p><p> I will discuss the four concrete proposals we have.  One was mentioned by the Chairman, namely, transnational lists of candidates for the European elections.  The report by Andrew Duff in the European Parliament last year proposed for the 2014 elections a modest number of 25 Members of the European Parliament to be elected on a Europe wide list.  Very simply, that would give more power to European parties.  Unfortunately, it was not accepted and will not happen in the 2014 elections.  We may have it at a later date.<\/p><p> Roll call voting would increase the coherence of the political groups in the European Parliament and highlight political differences rather than having the permanent grand coalition we have had over the past number of decades between the two large blocs.  We propose that there be some form of direct election of the Commission President.  <\/p><p> The Council proposes after the European elections that the treaty for the European Union stipulates that the Council's proposal must take into account the result of the European elections, in other words, the relative balance of power in the European Parliament after the elections.  What exactly that means is debatable.  So far the expectation has been that the strongest group in the European Parliament - an absolute majority is very improbable - gets the right to propose the Commission President from its ranks.  That is how things were handled in 2004 and 2009. <\/p><p> In future, parties will propose the top candidate for the European elections who will become their nominees for the European Commission President.  It is putting a human face on political options.  We have never had a European election campaign with persons impersonating political options.  We will have this in the next election.  The socialists and EPP have already pledged to do so.  The Greens have done so and other political families will follow.  The two big political families are what are really important, namely, the centre-right and the left.<\/p><p> The potential of the Lisbon treaty in regard to an improved dialogue between the European Parliament and national parliaments is something we still have to fully exploit.  The conditions are in place to intensify that process but we have to use the potential of the treaty.<\/p><p> In the long term we will need a truly bicameral system of legislation at a European level.  The European Parliament will become the lower chamber which is directly elected by the citizens and the upper chamber will represent member states and will be what the Council of Ministers is today.  The Heads of Government which will meet at regular intervals will be a part of the executive together with the Commission.  The Commission and European Council will be two parts of the executive whereas the legislative will be the Council of Ministers and European Parliament.  <\/p><p> The European Parliament needs the right to legal initiative.  One might think of merging the Commission and Council Presidents.  That is a debated notion because, as I said, the executive and legislative would be merged which is problematic in terms of democratic theory.  It is idea which is being discussed and we should explore it further.<\/p><p> That completes our proposal for completing democratic legitimacy in the European Union.  I am happy to discuss it with the committee, and answer questions about the role of the United Kingdom and the German perspective on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Roland Freudenstein","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371723000,"counter":845,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Freudenstein.

As a parliamentarian I must confess I did not know no roll call vote was called in the European Parliament.  It is something which is shocking to have to admit.

I refer to the comments on England.  Mr. Freudenstein spoke of having supernational authority which can overrule national decisions when it comes to economic affairs raising yet another important question.  The United Kingdom is currently asking that very question.  It claims it wants to withdraw elements of authority from the centre back to the national.  Can Mr. Freudenstein comment on where it is going in this regard?<\/p><p>  On the democratic role of the European Parliament, the T&aacute;naiste, our Deputy Prime Minister, has completed very intensive talks with the Parliament on its budgetary decisions.  The British claim managing to reduce the budget is a good decision and claim it as a victory, but others would claim otherwise.  It now appears that the Parliament has the democratic right to veto or seek changes to the budget as proposed.   Can Mr. Freudenstein elaborate on how the process will be carried out? <\/p><p>  Some parliamentarians are independent and others are affiliated to parties in their own countries.  Do national parliaments in countries like Germany, Ireland or France lobby their MEPs to support or reject proposals?  What dialogue exists, given the importance of the budget and the European Parliament making a decision?  Does pressure come from national parliaments on those who are established political representatives of political parties?<\/p><p>  We are essentially talking about the democratisation of the process.  We know France has Cabinet members which represent its diaspora.  There are members who vote in its embassies in every election.<\/p> <p>There is a form of democracy.  By contrast, we do not even allow the diaspora to vote in presidential elections.  The Iranian ambassador informs me that his embassy was open last Friday to receive the votes of Iranians living in Ireland.  I understand even Albania and perhaps Bulgaria and Romania open wide their embassies to receive their citizens to allow them to participate in the democratic process.  I agree, however, that there are major challenges.  As Irish public representatives, we must recognise that this country is way behind in the democratic participative process by not allowing the diaspora to vote in various elections, let alone asking MEPs to toe the line of the party.  It is a fascinating debate and I look forward to hearing the views of other contributors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000004#C00500","speaker":"1030","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371723600,"counter":850,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Freudenstein and thank him for the brevity of his contribution, which means that we have more time for questions and discussion.  I have three questions for him, two of which are based on his contribution.  <\/p><p>  Mr. Freudenstein acknowledges the need for a greater role for national parliaments with respect to future developments in budgetary policy.  I ask him to outline how he thinks the role of national parliaments could change.  The most likely mechanism for the European Union in developing political legitimacy would be to give national parliaments, instead of the European Parliament, a role in dealing with budgetary as opposed to non-budgetary issues.  What could be the future role of national parliaments in dealing with the concerns expressed about political legitimacy?  <\/p><p>  My second question follows from a point made by Mr. Freudenstein about how the Commission might become politicised.  Ireland would see the role of the Commission as being the neutral mechanism in the middle and not open to control by large countries, for example.  That is why Ireland has always been very supportive of the <i>communautaire<\/i> system of policy-making.  How does Mr. Freudenstein see that role of the Commission being maintained in the context of the politicisation of the Commission or can it be maintained in the context of what he is proposing?  <\/p><p>  My third question is a general one about the development of the eurozone.  Mr. Freudenstein's submission touches on some of the ways by which that could happen such as a banking union, mutualisation of debt, and so on.  Will there be different speeds of integration within the eurozone?  I find it difficult to imagine every country agreeing to the kind of integration that the eurozone will need in the future not only for it to survive but also to prosper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000005#D00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1371723600,"counter":851,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Freudenstein and thank him for his contribution.  We had similar discussions at previous meetings and with Francis Jacobs from European Parliament Ireland.  Mr. Freudenstein is trying to improve democracy and accountability at a time of increasing unpopularity of the concept of the European Union and polarisation within many member states owing to the economic crisis.  This time last year Ireland passed the stability treaty in a democratic referendum, which was a positive action.  Will the issue of a directly elected EU President become bound up with the nationality of a candidate?  Will this cause division between north and south or perhaps the eastern bloc versus the old West, smaller countries and larger countries, rather than be a choice between the parties and policies represented by the candidates?  I refer to the animosity between a number of countries.  In Mr. Freudenstein's paper on the subject of democracy and legitimacy in the European Union he refers to the European Central Bank which is never able to fix an optimum interest rate.  This has been suggested as a reason for the boom experienced in Ireland, Spain and Portugal because interest rates were kept low to suit Mr. Freudenstein's country and France.  He states in his paper that until such time as there is convergence of the economies of Europe, this issue will not be fixed.  I ask him to expand on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000005#D00300","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371723600,"counter":852,"content":"<p>I will begin with Deputy Eric Byrne's questions.  On the matter of the roll-call vote and the practices of the European Parliament, two factors have been at play which do not apply to that extent in national parliaments.  One is that national differences in the European Parliament overlap and sometimes run contrary to political families, so to speak.  This happens also in member states in the case of regions but certainly not as strongly as in the European Parliament where it is not only political allegiance to one political family that counts but sometimes also very much nationality.  This tends to influence the decisions and weaken the hold of political groups over their members.  In the European Parliament there is usually a grand coalition in place to deal with many of the questions that are considered painful, that is, all of the really important questions on labour law, the working time directive, consumer protection, the use of chemicals and the services guidelines.  There is a fear that a voting result of 51%-49% in the European Parliament will make the losing side turn anti-European.  This fear has increased with the rise of populists in European politics.  It is probably an unhealthy, vicious circle.  The rise of populists reinforces the grand coalition mentality in Brussels which, in turn, reinforces the rhetoric of the populists that the Brussels elite is remote from citizens, that the members of this elite are all in cahoots.  The view is that they agree on all the decisive questions and that there are no real political alternatives.  That cycle has to be broken by making an effort to highlight the political alternatives.  One of the means of doing this would be by having stronger factional discipline in the European Parliament which in our view would be promoted by the roll-call vote system.<\/p><p>  On the role of the United Kingdom, the development in the past few months has been staggering.  No one on the Continent or here expected such a quick erosion of a constructive attitude to the European Union.  I am not referring solely to the Conservative Party but also to the media and public opinion.  I am even talking about the lobby  group of entrepreneurs and the big business community which we continentals considered to be our lobby in Great Britain.  For a couple of years there was a group called Business for a New Europe which was pro-European and europhile.  That group still exists and is advocating its policies, but suddenly the group called Business for Britain has appeared which is much more vocal and radical in the sense of being anti-European.  This group has become more prominent than the group Business for a New Europe.  This is an example of how things have accelerated in a direction which we really cannot comprehend.<\/p> <p> As to where this will end up, the answer is that we will either have a marginal status for Great Britain within the framework of the European Union or else a so-called brexit.  Germany is one of the countries that absolutely does not want the latter to happen.  The two countries have common ground on a range of policy issues.  In recent months, to take just one example, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, and the German Chancellor, Ms Merkel, have more or less closed ranks on the question of the future of the European budget.  Another aspect is that nobody on the Continent imagines that a Common Foreign and Security Policy which did not include Great Britain would be taken seriously anywhere in the world.  It is impossible to say what the consequences of a decision by the British people to exit the European Union would be, but attempts will certainly be made both in Britain and among its partners in the Union to patch up the situation somehow and find a <i>modus vivendi<\/i>.  Mr. Cameron has spoken about repatriating substantial powers from the European institutions to the British Government, but that will not happen.  It would be bad enough to see Britain leaving the European Union, but it would be even worse to see the Union falling apart in a situation in which different countries were seeking to renegotiate their statuses.  In that situation we would have not just two tiers but also a fringe comprising countries that did not want to join the core in the long term, all with different statuses.<\/p><p> The link between national parliaments and the European Parliament and its respective political groups is an issue that must be addressed.  I cannot deliver a perfect solution in this regard and can only say that the sway held by, for example, the leadership of the German Christian Democratic Union Party and its national caucus over their people in the European Parliament is not absolute, at least during the first four years of a five-year parliamentary term.  The last year is critical, of course, because that is when the discussion on the candidate lists for the next election begins, a matter that is in the control of national party chairmen.  As long as that remains the case we will see, in the last phase of a parliamentary term, increased power for national party leaderships over their people in the Parliament.  That is why the European Parliament party groupings - not just the European People's Party but others too - are advocating to change the system to give the power of nomination to themselves and not the national party leaderships.  The reality, however, is that the latter will retain that power for as long as they wish.  It should be noted too that there are a couple of disadvantages in transferring that right to the European parties.  Generally speaking, there is a huge difference in perspective as between people in Brussels and their respective national parties, especially in the case of Germany.  The Berlin perspective on the euro crisis, for instance, and therefore on the institutional future of the European Union, differs substantially from that of Brussels, in that it is much less federalist.<\/p><p> I cannot answer the point regarding votes for diasporas.  I assume that the considerable size of the Irish diaspora is a factor in the differences the Deputy described.<\/p><p> Deputy Paschal Donohoe spoke about a greater role for national parliaments.  I agree it is important for the purposes of legitimacy, but the question is how to achieve it.  In the context of what is now in place by way of the Lisbon treaty, it is very difficult to say.  There is a view in certain quarters that the second chamber of the proposed bicameral system should be comprised not of representatives of member states or of the Council but rather of delegates from national parliaments.  The idea would be to pool the most active and dynamic members of national parliaments, those with a real interest in European affairs, and have perhaps four sessions per year in Brussels or Strasbourg.  Those representatives would make up a type of senate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000005#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Roland Freudenstein","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371724200,"counter":854,"content":"<p>Would such a chamber be similar to the German Bundesrat, which takes members from the different l&auml;nder?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000006#E00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371724200,"counter":855,"content":"<p>The Bundesrat consists of members of the L&auml;nder governments, not members of the legislatures.  I am not aware of any national example - although there may be such a case - in which members of regional legislatures make up the second chamber of a bicameral national parliamentary system.  That is what is proposed under this particular model.<\/p><p>  It must be acknowledged that there is a trade-off between substantially increased involvement by national legislatures and the efficiency and speed of European legislation.  If the slowness, inertia and complexity of decision-making at European level is already contributing to populist views on European institutions, the question then is whether a more substantial formal role for national parliaments on top of what we already have will see any improvement in that regard.  That must be a huge factor in any decision.  In seeking to provide enhanced legitimacy there is a danger that we will <i>de facto<\/i> reduce it in another respect by making the whole process more complicated.  We already have the European semester process whereby national parliaments look onto each other's plates as far as budgetary policies are concerned.  The extent to which that will evolve into real veto rights of one parliament over another is a question that remains to be answered.  We already have a situation in which national parliaments can tell their colleagues in another country that this or that is not in accordance with the agreed policy principles of the European Union.  We do not, however, have 100% watertight sanction mechanisms in place in case of violations.<\/p><p>  On the politicisation of the Commission, I agree that the neutrality, in a party political sense, of the Commission is one of the cornerstones of the Rome treaties and indeed the whole system.  I am saying that if we go the way the federalists in Brussels want to go, it will be the most fundamental reform of the system of European integration we have ever seen.  If the Commission is to achieve greater legitimacy and to be seen by citizens as the executive which emanates from their own political choice in the ballot box, then we need to give political parties more of a role in the Commission.  That goes against the grain of the Rome treaties and probably against the grain of what we now see as the Community method.  It is unavoidable, however, if we want to go down that road.  The alternative is to accept that we will not achieve the best possible degree of democratic legitimacy.  In the context of the grand coalition mentality in the European Parliament to which I referred, as soon as we have political parties dominating the Commission in an open manner we will get not only more winners but also more losers.  Parts of the constituency will inevitably feel excluded as a result of a particular democratic decision, the victory of majority over minority.  For these reasons, we must think any changes through very carefully.  If we want to increase democratic legitimacy, we must accept there will be side effects such as the one I have outlined.  This is especially true for small countries.  Many of the federalist proposals since the 1990s, for example, envisage a reduction in the number of Commissioners.  Promises have been made in this regard.<\/p> <p>When we turn the next corner with the next treaty reform, we will - regardless of the number of member states - finally reduce or at least freeze the number of Commissioners.  We have never previously managed that and I can understand why.  Small countries are of the view that if the Commission is something akin to an executive in Brussels, then they want to be represented on it.  They want this even if the individual involved is legally committed to representing the Union's interests.  They want a <i>de facto<\/i>presence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Roland Freudenstein","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371724800,"counter":857,"content":"<p>That point was widely debated in this country during the first referendum campaign relating to the Lisbon treaty.

However, I have observed how the Commissioners' cabinets operate and the amount of work they are obliged to devote to what they call &quot;covering&quot; the cabinets of the other Commissioners is growing exponentially.  We are now at a point where the machine starts creating its own work and the energy that is necessary to keep it going.  In terms of portfolios of actual policy fields to be addressed by the European Commission, it is completely nonsensical to have more than 20.  Even 15 would probably be a high number.  We do not need that many Commissioners.  The Romanians and the Bulgarians joined the EU but having a Commissioner for Multilingualism is a bit of a joke.  To be honest, this provides grist to the mill of the populists.  If we consider the cost that is involved with having a Commissioner, a director general and so on, it really makes no sense.  However, I understand that point that every country needs its representative in Brussels.  I have no perfect solution for that conundrum.  I am merely pointing it out.  I see the reason for there being 27 - soon to be 28 - Commissioners but I do not think this is sustainable if we want to reach a more efficient and democratically legitimate system of European institutions.<\/p><p>  On the different speeds, there are some member states - the capital of one of which is Paris - which have been dreaming about a two-tier Union for a long time, essentially since the mid-1990s.  Having a core Europe was very much a French idea.  It was, to a degree, the French reaction to the eastern enlargement of the European Union.  The latter made France uncomfortable for a couple of reasons, many of which have to do with its eastern neighbour, Germany.  To have a core Union would be to re-establish a system in which France could continue to play its role.  Now that the Franco-German couple has actually transformed into something new - I am being careful and I am not saying it is over because the basis is very solid on a civil society level - and does not work as it used to work, all the front lines in the old European discourse are changing as well.  The German ideal is that if it is necessary to have a two-tier Europe, then it will probably be the eurozone and the rest - that is, the EU 17 versus the EU 10, which will soon be 11 with the accession of Croatia.  However, the core must be open to whomever wants and is able to join.  That is a precondition.  One does not hear that half sentence in Paris very much these days.  The ideal is to have a much more permanent structure with a core and a loose periphery, which may, of course, contain Britain in some role.<\/p><p>  Why is Germany insisting on having a two-tier system only temporarily and with as few institutional differences as possible?  To put it very simply, Germany feels exactly the opposite to France.  Many of its natural allies in the context of the philosophical approach to economics, solid finances, transatlantic relations, etc., are in the EU 10 rather than the EU 17.  Germany is very much of the view that its natural allies are out there, which is why they should not be distanced from the core too much.  There are national factors at play in this regard.  In Brussels, in the EPP and in general among those who consider themselves federalist, a two-speed Europe that would be in place for a period is considered inevitable.  Again, this will probably coagulate around the eurozone for the moment.  Optimally, it would be temporary and as many countries as possible would be in the core.  Perhaps one day there could be a situation where everyone would be on board again.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kyne inquired about a referendum.  Every member state has its mechanisms of ratification.  Some member states such as Germany do not even hold referenda.  Ireland's position on grand treaty change is very careful and cautious.  Such change would be a precondition for most of what I have outlined in my paper.  That change would begin after the next European election and would probably commence with an intergovernmental conference in 2015.  It will have to be put to a referendum.  One can discuss whether all member states will be obliged to agree or whether a minimum threshold of, for example, 20 member states should be fixed.  There are those who state that in the context of treaty change, a clause should be inserted to the effect that any change must be approved by at least 20 member states in order that it might enter into force.  There would be a<i> de facto<\/i> opt out for some countries but with corresponding consequences.<\/p><p>  In the context of the direct election of the presidents of the Commission or the Council, we are all aware that this would only be possible through treaty change.  As I described and according to the Lisbon treaty, the current procedure is that the European Council makes a proposal based on the results of the European elections and then the European Parliament elects - <i>de facto<\/i>, it rubber stamps the proposal.  Of course the Parliament can state beforehand that it is going to reject the person put forward and if this is deemed a credible threat, then the Council will probably put forward a different proposal.  It will be very interesting to observe the next election.  What I was proposing in the short-term - this would be possible without treaty change - would be an indirect election of the President by having top candidates for the campaigns of the big political families in the European Parliament elections.  This election would involve those families saying, &quot;If you vote for us, you will get that person for Commission President&quot;.  This is already a big step towards more democratic legitimacy which would fall below the threshold of a treaty change that would, as I pointed out, unleash a series of problems.<\/p><p>  The next matter that arises in this regard relates to what will be the divisions.  Will they be north, south, east, west, large, small or whatever?  The answer is that they will all come into play.<\/p> <p>It is in a way an open process and it will be interesting to see what effect the sheer existence of top candidates for the political families will have.  Will it reverse or at least halt the decrease in turnout?  Will it contribute to a sense of European <i>demos<\/i>, an all-European constituency?  Will it lead to those divisions that the Chairman pointed out?  One could imagine saying that even the candidates will probably have to come from larger member states.  Even if they come from one large member state, will they be acceptable in a different one?  If the President were to come from a smaller state that might be an advantage because it would be more acceptable to all the big member states.  It is a totally open question but we will all learn about the European Union, its future and what it will mean for ourselves in this run-up to the elections in May 2014.<\/p><p> Regarding the European Central Bank, there is a basic difference between a more Germany-centred philosophy of a totally independent European Central Bank and a more French-centred philosophy of making the ECB much more politically accountable to the powers that be, whether they be the national governments, the European institutions or a European government in the future.  That is an open question and the role it could play to further economic convergence is contained within that question.  I do not see the role of the ECB changing very much in any new set-up that I have described.  For example, Germany would be extremely hesitant to change anything regardless of what other treaty changes we may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000007#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Roland Freudenstein","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371725400,"counter":864,"content":"<p>Before I ask my colleagues to contribute, I want to make a few points on the European elections.  The potential to give the right of nomination of candidates to Europe parties would be resisted at a national level.  It is important that we retain the link that exists when individual party members choose their candidate, because it ensures a certain element of democratic legitimacy for that candidate.  We would be loth to see the end of that.  I want to ask Mr. Freudenstein about the elections next year.  I met some PES colleagues from another member state yesterday and their view about next year's elections is very much like ours, namely, that they will represent a referendum on the government in power as opposed to a vote on a vision - from among differing visions - for Europe.  We around this table represent the Government parties in Ireland but we are members of two European parties, the SDP and the EPP, which are represented here.  The elections next year should be between EPP and SDP policies and proposals but in reality the fight is more likely to be about us as a Government versus the Opposition.  I know there is at least one potential candidate for next year's European elections here, and I would like to hear from Ms Prendergast, MEP, who will speak shortly.  How does Mr. Freudenstein think the election will pan out in terms of campaigning next year?  Is it likely that individual candidates will be pushing a European message or are they still likely to go down the road of arguing for or against the government of the day?  What change does he expect compared to the 2009 elections?  I would be interested to hear his view on that.<\/p><p>  Does Deputy Durkan want to speak?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000008#G00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1371725400,"counter":865,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Freudenstein and thank him for his contribution.  I find a few points he mentioned alarming - I am not an alarmist by nature, but sometimes I get alarmed.  One point concerned the growing tendency among the larger European countries to dominate the debate and the politics of Europe.  That is a dangerous development and it is not in line, as Mr. Freudenstein mentioned, with the original vision of Europe.  It is a departure from that.  For example, we had a discussion in our Houses of Parliament on comments by the Bundestag on budgetary projections and proposals.  Those proposals were necessary and we accept that.  We signed up to the memorandum of understanding following the economic collapse.  We stuck to that without variation.  The Government parties valiantly stuck to it and some of the Opposition parties grudgingly stuck to it.  The people stayed with us on it, which was difficult for them to do, and huge sacrifices were made by them, about which many other people throughout Europe and in the European institutions know.  However, just because there were no demonstrations on the streets, no protests, no baton charges and no water cannons, it does not mean we did this painlessly.  Huge sacrifices were made, including by the trade unions, who constructively led their people, recognising what the options were.<\/p><p>  That brings me to the issue of responsible politics.  There has been a tendency in recent years throughout Europe to run before the populists and that is a dangerous route to go.  We all have to explain to the electorate that the consequences of what they do in the ballot box will reflect afterwards outside.  That is one thing for which we all have to take our share of responsibility.  We all try do that individually here.  We may not always succeed but at least we try.  It is hugely important that the electorate, at either national or European level, recognise fully the consequences of what they do and relate it directly to what will happen afterwards by virtue of the way they vote.  I will not quote Disraeli on that one but I will turn to Oscar Wilde for a suitable quotation in this context.  He said that duty is what we expect of others but not necessarily of ourselves.  That is very important to remember at this time.  All of us at every level throughout Europe have a responsibility at this particular juncture.<\/p><p>  Mr. Freudenstein mentioned taking ownership.  How often have we talked about taking ownership of the European project here? The fact is that certain European countries are opting out and are taking ownership of what suits them as opposed to what suits the entire European Union.  Certain countries opted out originally from the EMU or from the euro, for whatever reason.  Some were not able initially to aspire to it and others decided to opt out of it for tactical purposes.  We have discussed that here and not everybody agrees with me on it.  I am not an expert in this area but I strongly believe that a single currency right across the European Union is the only answer and that any deviations from that will ultimately, and could only ever, lead to a division within the Union - a two-tier Europe, a two-speed Europe, or both.  I think we are heading in that direction.  There is an onus on the larger countries to address that situation because they have more influence.  It worries the small countries when we read comments in the international media from some of our neighbours which appear to be directed at ourselves.  We have always believed that we have been good Europeans.  We have taken and continue to take ownership of the European project.  I will give an example in this respect.  We always believed that the European Central Bank, and fiscal policy throughout the eurozone in particular, was the means of bringing the European economies together.  That would have meant that the central bank in each eurozone country fed into the ECB, and the ECB, in turn, would have had a position of oversight on fiscal policy in the individual member states of eurozone, but what happened?  They seemed to detach themselves from it entirely and everything went crazy.  The degree of accountability that should have been in place did not exist.  Some people knew what was going to happen.  Some people pointed all of these things out, but we were all led and misled by expert opinion, and it was wrong.<\/p><p>  I also have strong reservations about the politicisation of the Commission.  It is a step in the wrong direction and it will be hugely divisive, particularly for the smaller member states of the Union.  We should consider what is happening.  The power of the European Parliament has increased and, under the Lisbon treaty, the power of the national parliaments has also increased.<\/p> <p>There is an inherent conflict and I do not see how it can work because unless the national parliaments take ownership of the European project to a greater extent than they have done - that includes our next door neighbour and all other countries within the European Union and the eurozone - then it cannot work because there is a blockage.  There is no seamless movement between the two.<\/p><p> The other point of note about membership of the European Parliament is that initially members of national parliaments were appointed and then they were directly elected to the European Parliament so we had a continuous influence in the European Parliament from the national parliaments.  It was not a distinct separation as we have now.

I agree with the points made by Deputy Donohoe and Deputy Durkan on the politicisation of the Commission.<\/p><p>  I wish to clarify for my colleague, Deputy Byrne, that we sign into all of our committee meetings and group meetings and at plenary there are roll-call votes for everything so there is a different interpretation of what that means.  At any time a Member can ask for a check and get a roll-call vote taken on any piece of legislation.  The roll-call vote record is a crude tool on which to measure one&rsquo;s attendance because it does not equate with one&rsquo;s actual presence.  It is a little confusing how things work.<\/p><p>  One of the areas of frustration in terms of people who criticise Europe is the fact that the majority of Parliament has voted consistently to have a single seat in Brussels but because of the treaty in France there must be 12 sittings a year in Strasbourg.  The difficulty is that the cost is significant, including financially, for transporting all that goes with the travelling circus to go to Strasbourg each month and sometimes it is every couple of weeks, as it is currently.  Does Mr. Freudenstein have a view on that?<\/p><p>  With future accessions and proposals for further enlargement the difficulty is that we will suffer the loss of an MEP.  If Turkey joins we will probably be further reduced because there is a cap on the number of MEPs that can be in Parliament and we will have a very much reduced representation in Europe as well.  That makes people nervous because on one hand it depends on the spin but it is very populist to talk about a travelling circus if one is an opponent of what Europe and being European means.  People have commented on the fact that we have had a couple of referenda because we did not like the first response of the people.  People felt very much put-upon because the belief is that we did not understand the first time because we were stupid.  However, it was not stupidity, it was a means of communicating a position that could be interpreted and bringing in all sorts of unrelated issues into the debate, including abortion.  The former Chairman of the committee well knows the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000009#H00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil Prendergast"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371726000,"counter":875,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman.  I will start with the right of nomination for the European elections.  I accept the point.  I think we are going to stick to the system we have, which is that every party and every country decides for itself.  I do not see a concrete possibility of the eurozone parties formally getting that right because they would have to get it from their member parties and the member parties are not going to give it to them.  What I am giving to the committee is the Brussels debate but I am completely in agreement that to have the presidents of the eurozone parties assign the national candidate lists for the European Parliament will not happen any time soon.  I know that.<\/p><p>  As to whether the next election will be a referendum on the governments in power, yes, it will be more so than ever.  That is thanks to the euro crisis.  The euro crisis has, strategically speaking, a totally paradoxical effect.  On the one hand it has highlighted the differences between member states.  The Greek-German relationship is tarnished - to put it mildly - for many years to come.  When a Greek and a German talk in Brussels, there is an elephant in the room.  One can choose to address it or not but it is still there.  There is one effect, that not only the populist parties but public media in the member states are suddenly highlighting national differences.  At the same time, not only will the next European election become much more of a referendum on the ways national governments and European institutions have dealt with the euro crisis, but even national elections are becoming European elections.  Let us look at the last ten national parliamentary elections.  They all had, to varying degrees, very strong European components, for example, Italy and France.  In that sense, the European Peoples Party, EPP, still holds a plurality of member state governments.  It used to be a majority.  At the highest point something like 17 out of 27 governments were controlled by the EPP political family but now it is down to 12.  Counting those governments where national EPP member party is part of a coalition, it is still by far the biggest political force in the European Council.<\/p><p>  The elections will be a referendum on the combination of reform and fiscal consolidation that has been the strategy for the past couple of years.  I do not believe that this is a lost cause <i>per se<\/i>.  It cannot be explained to voters that one cannot print money; that one can only spend money either that one has or where one is able to say how and when one will pay it back.  These are the simple things at play.  The fact is that we have to reform and promote innovation.  There are member states in which it is easier to explain that to voters and there are some in which it is harder.  Generally speaking, it is probably harder in the south.  I am afraid that is the mission of the EPP political family in these elections.<\/p><p>  As to the extent to which campaigning will change or still reflect national debates in the European elections, that depends very much on which member state one is talking about.<\/p> <p>In general, as I just said, we will see a &quot;Europeanisation&quot; of the next European Parliament election campaign.  Ultimately, the strategies are made by the member parties.  The member parties in the different member states determine their election campaign strategy for the European election.  There will be varying degrees of national elements in that and punishing, or not punishing, the government in power for what they did in the euro crisis, but the euro crisis will be a very important factor in that.<\/p><p> On Deputy Durkan's question on large and small countries, and several other members addressed this question, I fully understand the concerns of small member states.  It has been part and parcel of the European integration process that there is a systemic over-representation of small countries, whether we talk about the voting shares in the European Council or the numbers of MEPs different countries delegate to Brussels and Strasbourg.  I also know that in many member states, and the German Bundesrat was mentioned earlier, there is a very strong over-representation of the small<b><font color=\"#222222\"><\/font><\/b>L&auml;nders <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the big ones, yet in the pronouncement of the German constitutional court some years ago, the legitimacy of the European Parliament was relativised because it is far from one man, one person, one vote.  All I am saying is that it has to be taken into account.  In any future European democracy we will have an element of over-representation of the small constituents but we should be aware that, to an extent, that is at the cost of democratic legitimacy, at least in the eyes of the citizens and political forces in the big member states.  We need to balance this out, one against the other, sit down and rationally discuss it.<\/p><p> Are the sacrifices of the countries undergoing the harshest reform programmes and consolidation processes not seen in the countries that are doing comparatively well?  How could they?  Unless we bring 82 million Germans here to the island, which is something I do not wish for the members, how could they possibly experience the hardships through which this country is going?  I agree they can try to explain that.  In Chancellor Merkel's speeches in recent years there is an element, when she talks to her German constituents, that solidarity is not just a Kumbaya thing.  It is in our self-interest that the eurozone survives and, therefore, the European Union survives.  Germans cannot pretend they are just footing the bill for everyone else because that is not the case.  It is not that simple.  She is saying that, and she may not be a master communicator, especially when it comes to television or huge gatherings, but she has made that try.  Certainly, there are improvements to be made to that communications strategy, both within Germany and outside Germany.  I will come to that later.<\/p><p> Do the political parties have a tendency to run before the populists?  I am not so sure.  In many cases centre or centre right parties have completely shied away from even addressing certain questions.  I am talking especially about immigration and integration in the Netherlands, for example.  Part of the huge crisis the Christian Democratic Appeal, CDA, party is going through in the Netherlands is that for several decades it had completely lost touch.  Even addressing the question of integration of large Muslim populations in city centres was considered too &quot;Geert Wilders&quot;, and that is not the case.  That only increases the voting share of the dangerous populist.<\/p><p> My answer to that, and this refers to the euro crisis also, is that the issues that bother the people must be addressed.  The solutions proposed must be different, but in terms of not mentioning a subject or not addressing fears that objectively exist among the voters for fear of seeming to be running with the populists, I am not sure that is the right strategy.  As is the case in the countries undergoing painful processes, the political parties must understand and reflect the pain of their electorates <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the other member states and the Brussels institutions.  The same is true for the other member states where people have the impression that they are signing cheques all the time, which is not the case but at least the issue has to be addressed by the leading politicians.<\/p><p> On the national interest versus the EU interest, I tried to address that.  There is a complex relationship.  Let us call things by their names.  Is Germany nationalistic?  Is Germany egoistic?  It is a good question.  Germany is finding itself in a role for which it is utterly unprepared.  To be the dominant power of Europe not only economically but politically is something no one in Germany would have dreamed of or had nightmares about five years ago.  Germany has been thrown into cold water, so to speak.  There is no open, down to earth national discourse on what is our interest in Germany.  Consequently, there is too little of what other Europeans now expect from Germany in terms of leadership.  The Polish foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, in probably one of the most remarkable speeches of the past 12 years, in Berlin stated that he is less afraid of German power than he is of German passivity.  That stung people in Berlin, but we still have not developed an answer to that.<\/p><p> There is no-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000009#H01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Roland Freudenstein","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371726600,"counter":877,"content":"<p>Is that debate likely between now and the election or has it been kicked to one side until after the election?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000010#J00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371726600,"counter":878,"content":"<p>No.  This is ever-present.

This is for the think-tanks, the foreign affairs committees of parliament and the media.  I do not believe it plays a big role in the election campaign, but that might be a bad thing.  Perhaps it should be discussed more among the competing political options in Germany.  There is no definition of national interest, no leadership, no notion of soft power in the sense of Joseph Nye or the instruments, as soon as they have made up their mind, with which they want to bring this across to the others and, as part of this, no communication strategy for explaining why the federal government is proposing this or that.  They are not explaining to their own people or to their partners in the European Union.<\/p><p>  There are three or four factors involved in that.  One is the weight of history but sometimes that is just a pretext for laziness.  Frankly speaking, most Germans, and this is corroborated in opinion polls, still want to be a big Switzerland.  They would prefer to be rich, neutral and not disliked anywhere.  They would not aspire to a leadership role, and certainly not in a military sense.  That is another can of worms.  What all this means is that Germany is unprepared.  It will take Germany a long time to grow into that role of leading on the one hand but, on the other hand, trying to build coalitions and lead with others, listening to smaller partners in the European Union and trying to convince them that what Germany is proposing at this moment is in their interest too.  That is leadership, and I have to admit it is not happening sufficiently at the moment.<\/p> <p> As to whether the European Central Bank, ECB, is more detached today from fiscal policy in the EU member states than before, I do not think the ECB ever had or even should have a role in determining fiscal policies in the member states.

Surely the member states' national central banks must feed into the European Central Bank in order to have the overall strategy and policy of all European countries moving generally, albeit not necessarily to the same extent, in the same direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000011#K00300","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371727200,"counter":884,"content":"<p>Moving in the same direction in what sense?  The national banks do not determine the budgetary policy of the respective governments.  I understood the Deputy in such a way that the ECB should take care of national fiscal policies.  Perhaps it is simply a different understanding of terms but while national banks have a role to play, as far as the euro, the interest rate and so on are concerned, monetary stability is the prerogative of the ECB.  However, in my view that does not cover a brief in which the ECB would interfere in the question of national budgets and so on.  That is done by the Commission, the Council and by the peer group of other national parliaments in the European semester and so on but there, the ECB does not play the decisive role.  That is all I am saying and I do not believe we are very far apart on this question.  As to what economists think, probably a lot of economists are convinced the ECB should play a more political role in general but a lot of economists are convinced that the ECB should stick to its guns and I think in this crisis in general, there are just a lot of economists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000011#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Roland Freudenstein"},{"type":"speech","time":1371727200,"counter":885,"content":"<p>Casualties as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000011#K00500","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371727200,"counter":886,"content":"<p>As for Commission size, I understand the concerns.  My realistic prediction is we will not have a substantial change in this regard over the next couple of years.  However, members should consider that it is not simply a question of how many Commissioners and how many black Mercedes cars or Peugeots or whatever they drive in Brussels.  In addition, the collegiate principle of the Commission means each Commissioner has a vote when the Commission discusses, decides and votes.  There is also a voting mechanism within the European Commission and as this greatly complicates the decision-making process, members should take that into consideration.<\/p><p>  As to whether someone can survive and remain sane while being in a national parliament and involved in the European Parliament, yes of course.  In fact, I believe we should have more back and forth between national parliaments and the European Parliament.  Some member states are doing this very well, while others are terrible at it.  Germany is terrible at this.  There are very few cases of successful national parliamentarians going to Brussels and Strasbourg and even fewer cases of people coming back.  There is one single case I know of in which a CDU ex-MEP became a national member of parliament, namely, Friedrich Merz.  I think the Greens now also have one but it is a total exception and it should happen more, as there should be more exchange in this regard.<\/p><p>  This brings me to the question on a single seat for the European Parliament asked by Ms Phil Prendergast, who was obliged to leave the meeting.  There was a mean April fools' day joke this year in the European bubble.  After the European Council meeting of late March, which ended on a Friday afternoon, a colleague of mine wrote a column - it is on the Carnegie Foundation's website - in which he referred to the ignominy of the Brussels decision to create a third seat for the European Parliament.  What he did was to give a fictitious story of how, late on a Friday afternoon when all the press had already left, there was some horse-trading about the multi-annual financial framework and as part of this, Dresden was given the third seat.  While I just loved this joke, at least I recognised it as such.  However, the joke is that many people did not recognise this as a joke and reacted furiously on Facebook, writing things like this was another example of Brussels folly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000011#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Roland Freudenstein"},{"type":"speech","time":1371727200,"counter":887,"content":"<p>Of course, we should add that Dresden is a very nice city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000011#K00700","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371727200,"counter":888,"content":"<p>Absolutely, it is a nice city and my humorous response to this of course was to ask what people had against this decision.  I called them classical Carolingian western Europeans, who do not trust the Ossis or the new member states and how this would have been such a beautiful gesture and so on.  However, the significant part of that story is that people actually thought it to be credible and this should make us sad.  The French actually have no problem with a single seat, as long as it is Strasbourg.  I do not see any change in the near future but I acknowledge having the two-seat policy again is water on the mills of the populace and I understand it is a total waste.  There have been petitions and attempts to change this but there is no way to do so.<\/p><p>  Moreover, the more troublesome is the position of France domestically, economically and <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> its partners in the European Union, the more the French will dig in on this question.  There is no way the present French Government will change the two-seat policy.  The more troublesome is the position of France from an economic perspective, the more symbolic politics plays a huge role.  For example, members should consider the audiovisual exemption, the <i>exception culturelle<\/i> now being raised in respect of the question of the mandate for the coming trade talks between the European Union and the United States.  As experts tell me in Brussels, from an economic perspective there is very little to this at all and the Americans or Hollywood never insisted on having the audiovisual sector included.  However, France made a huge point of insisting on an exemption for the audiovisual sector for purely symbolic reasons.  This tells me the Strasbourg-Brussels question is not going to change in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013062000011#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Roland Freudenstein"},{"type":"speech","time":1371727200,"counter":889,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Freudenstein for those comments.
