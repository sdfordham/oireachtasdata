They now provide the seasonal flu vaccination to patients, including adults in &#8220;at risk&#8221; groups. Pharmacists have recently commenced  emergency hormonal contraception services. They provide advice on healthy eating, support with smoking cessation and importantly, advice to help patients manage their medications. In addition 65 community pharmacies participate in the community pharmacy needle exchange programme.<\/p><p>  Implementation of the <i>Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015<\/i>document, which was published in late 2012, is a priority for Government.  <i>Future Health<\/i>   sets out, at a high level, the main healthcare reforms, which will be introduced in the coming years to reshape the health system for the introduction of universal health insurance in 2016.  Delivering on the Government's goals in primary care will impact on primary care health professionals, including community pharmacists.<\/p><p>  As part of implementation of <i>Future Health,<\/i>  pharmacists will be expected to identify and contribute to implementing evidence-based and cost-effective solutions to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of the healthcare system, by addressing key medication issues such as medicines wastage, inappropriate usage of medicines, supporting and improving chronic disease management and patient adherence to medication.  <\/p><p>  Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which was commenced on 19 June 2013, community pharmacists will play an important role in facilitating generic substitution. This legislation gives effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government that reference pricing and greater use of generics would be introduced to reduce the State's drugs bill and the cost to individuals of their medicines. Through generic substitution pharmacists work with patients to promote the cost-effective use of medicines in order to achieve a sustainable health system.<\/p><p>  Hospital pharmacy practice has significantly developed in recent years in order to meet the need for a clinical pharmacy service within hospitals for patients and to support clinical teams.  The increasing complexity of new medicines and therapy regimes over the last 20 years in particular has meant that it has been necessary for hospital pharmacists to develop specialist clinical roles such as oncology, antimicrobial resistance (SARI), cardiovascular, neurology, respiratory and medication safety. Clinical pharmacy services within hospitals ensure the safe, appropriate, effective and cost-effective use of medicines for patients within secondary care. At the boundaries between primary and secondary care, there is scope for hospital pharmacists to make a significant contribution to promoting seamless care, and best use of medicines. <\/p><p>  Pharmacists have been key contributors to the HSE Clinical Care Programmes, particularly in the management of chronic illnesses (such as diabetes, stroke, heart failure, COPD and asthma).  Pharmacists working within the pharmaceutical industry also play a crucial role in maintaining the link between healthcare delivery and the Government's policy approach to the forging of strong partnerships with industry. <\/p><p>  Pharmacy education and training and continuing professional development for pharmacists is crucial in ensuring pharmacists are competent to take on new roles within healthcare delivery.  A new five-year integrated Masters level pharmacy degree across the three schools of pharmacy in Ireland is proposed in line with best international practice and it will ensure newly qualified pharmacists are clinically-focussed and have the competencies, as part of the delivery of integrated healthcare,  to support  patients in managing increasingly complex medicines therapy. Continuing Professional Development for pharmacists will progress the development of pharmacy practice in line with international best practice and evolving healthcare needs. <\/p><p>  International and national evidence demonstrates the significant impact pharmacists have in health gain for patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500070#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":57,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500070#WRB02550"},{"type":"question","counter":58,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[30411\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500070#WRB02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will detail the acute mental health services for children here; the numbers on waiting lists for same; the average, shortest and longest waiting times; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1102","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":59,"content":"<p>Community child and adolescent mental health teams are the first line of specialist mental health services for children and young people (under 18), who are directly referred to Community CAMHS Teams from various sources.

The Report specified that  adults in Ireland drink in a more dangerous way than in any other country.  In effect, Irish adults drank 11.6 litres of pure alcohol per capita in 2011.  The Steering Group reported that if every adult drank at the low risk ceiling quantity of alcohol every week the per capita consumption would be reduced to 9.2 litres of pure alcohol.  It also reported that one and a half million Irish drinkers drink in a harmful pattern.  <\/p><p>  Proposals are currently being finalised on foot of the Steering Group's recommendations.  These proposals cover all of the areas mentioned in the report, including measures on access and availability of alcohol; controls on alcohol advertising and sponsorship; labelling of alcohol products, and legislation on minimum unit pricing.  Minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels per gram of alcohol that must be legally observed by retailers.  Its primary function would be thus to discourage at risk levels of alcohol consumption and is targeted in particular at harmful and hazardous drinking.  The Report also recommended that new low risk limits for alcohol consumption be introduced based on Irish standard drink of 10 grams of alcohol i.e 11 standard drinks or 112 grams of pure alcohol per week for women and 17 standard drinks or 168 grams of pure alcohol per week for men.  <\/p><p>  The Department of Health has consulted and negotiated with Government colleagues extensively, since the publication of the Report, in order to reach consensus on the most effective way to tackle the problem of alcohol misuse in society.

The programme involves a number of measures, including the Performance Improvement Action Plan, development of the intermediate care service (ICS), the trial emergency aeromedical service (EAS), and the National Ambulance Service (NAS) Control Centre Reconfiguration Project.<\/p><p>  The NAS is taking steps to improve response times where possible, by addressing challenges such as reliance on on-call rostering, geography, resourcing and the use of emergency ambulances for routine patient transport.<\/p><p>  The NAS is moving its emergency ambulance services from on-call to on-duty rostering. This means highly trained paramedic crews are in their stations or vehicles to respond immediately to 112\/999 dispatches, and they can move to optimal locations at any time during a shift.

In preparing the Hospital Groups Report, the project group carried out a comprehensive consultation process with all acute hospitals, including those hospitals covered in the Smaller Hospitals Framework, and other key advocacy groups which requested an opportunity to be consulted. In addition, a significant number of submissions were received by the project group.  <\/p><p>  Implementation of the recommendations of the Hospital Group&rsquo;s Report has already commenced.  I have personally visited the areas covered by each of the six groups with my Department and the Director General Designate of the HSE, explaining the policy objectives and listening to the questions the staff in each of those areas have about this policy implementation.   Professor Higgins is also carrying out a debriefing exercise, supported by my Department and the HSE, to help ready the hospitals for the impending changes.   Since the launch of the Report, he has held approx. fifty meetings with hospitals in this regard.  The ongoing implementation of the Report will be overseen by a National Strategic Advisory Group, which will provide guidance and on-going direction to implementation of both the Hospital Groups Report and the Smaller Hospitals Framework and provide a forum to resolve issues and assist in the development of specific guidelines on the steps required for full implementation.  Implementation will be driven by the HSE through the Hospital Groups Implementation team which is currently being established.  As the new Hospital Groups are formed and their management teams appointed, each Group will give consideration to the consultation processes appropriate to that individual Group and to how stakeholders may be engaged with those processes. <\/p><p>  The implementation of the Framework for Smaller Hospitals has largely been completed around the country and the objective is to complete the remaining necessary changes dependent on required capacity being available in the regions and hospital groups concerned.  Hospital groups will be required to submit a strategic plan within one year of establishment which will outline its plans for future services within the group area, including those to be delivered in each smaller hospital.  Smaller hospitals will play a crucial role in the delivery of services and when groups are established, services can be exchanged between sites.  This will result in the enhancement of activity in smaller hospitals and will allow them to focus on the provision of care that is safe and appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500073#WRE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Departments Closures","counter":212,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500073#WRE01550"},{"type":"question","counter":213,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[30400\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500073#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will defer any decision on the cutting of accident and emergency services at Bantry General Hospital, County Cork, currently scheduled for 8 July, for a further 12 months until a full process of consultation with all relevant stakeholders, as outlined in the Future Care document, has been completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":214,"content":"<p>The Framework for Smaller Hospitals lists the services that are appropriate to a smaller hospital to ensure a safe, high quality services for patients.

Since this time many more children have access to safe water; more girls and boys are attending school, and far fewer people are dying of preventable illness such as malaria and HIV.  Much of this progress is attributed to the positive impact of international development assistance.<\/p><p>  The Government, through the Irish Aid programme, has contributed to these achievements.  A report produced earlier this month by the OECD, confirmed that over 80% of Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance is allocated to Least Developed Countries.  This is the highest allocation from any OECD Member State and is an enormously positive reflection on our aid programme.  These funds are directed at responding to emergency needs including food distribution, to supporting the development of social infrastructure in sectors such as education and health and to funding multi-sectoral programmes in social protection and nutrition.<\/p><p>  Combating global hunger and under-nutrition is a key pillar of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development assistance programme.  In 2008, the Hunger Task Force called on the Government to work towards an indicative target of directing twenty per cent of our overseas development assistance budget to hunger-related expenditure. In 2012 we delivered on that target.<\/p><p>  In 2012, Ireland contributed &euro;629 million to Official Development Assistance (ODA).  Over 80% of this funding was managed   under Vote 27 - International Cooperation through the Development Cooperation Division of my Department &ndash; known to the public as Irish Aid.  The remainder consists of ODA eligible contributions from other Government Departments - principally the Departments of Finance, and Agriculture Food and the Marine - and Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development Cooperation Budget for 2012.<\/p><p>  A full and detailed breakdown of Ireland&rsquo;s ODA spending and of the specific sectoral allocations is presented in the Irish Aid Annual Report which is compiled by my Department, each year.  The work on the report for 2012 is currently nearing completion. Preliminary expenditure data for 2012 demonstrates that approximately two thirds of Irish Aid funding was directed to the key sectors of Agriculture, Health, Education, Governance and Social Infrastructure Support.  The remainder is allocated for Emergency, Humanitarian Assistance, (including food and non-food distribution), Water and Sanitation, Sectoral Support and Programme Management.  I will arrange for a copy of the 2012 Irish Aid Annual Report to be forwarded to the Deputy following publication.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500073#WRE03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Missions Issues","counter":251,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500074#WRF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":252,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[30252\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500074#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when he expects the next trade mission to the US to occur; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":253,"content":"<p>My Department and its Embassy network support a range of trade missions in close co-operation with the relevant State Agencies.

The centrepiece of my programme in Atlanta was an &lsquo;Invest in Ireland&rsquo; Business Leaders Forum organised by the IDA in conjunction with our Consulate General, while the programme for New Orleans included business networking, political and cultural events.

In seeking election to the United Nations Security Council, Ireland will present its candidature on the basis of its firm commitment to the principles and values enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  We will draw on our record of dedicated service to the maintenance of international peace and security, our successful experience of conflict resolution on the island of Ireland and elsewhere, our active promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and our strong commitment to global economic and social development.  Ireland has served twice so far on the United Nations Security Council: during the periods 1981-1982 and 2001-2002.  Each of these terms was judged a success in terms of what we brought to the Council and the contribution we made to its deliberations and decisions.<\/p><p>  Ireland is widely perceived to have made an extremely positive contribution to the United Nations since we joined the Organization in 1955.

As co-guarantor of the Agreement, the Government supports those who want their children to benefit from integrated education and supports growth in that sector, from the less than 10% of schools in Northern Ireland which are currently within that scheme.  The NI Executive's recently published <i>Together: Building a United Community' <\/i>strategy sets a target of creating ten Shared Educational Campuses, along the model of the Lisanelly shared campus project in Omagh, and to make sharing in education a central part of every child's educational experience in Northern Ireland.

It seeks to support all schools, integrated or not, that want to offer pupils opportunities to address cultural and religious diversity.

The event is organised by my Department in close consultation with the African Embassies and the UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate School and we are working closely together to finalise the agenda for the October meeting.  The overall objective of the Africa Ireland Economic Forum is to facilitate the forging of opportunities for Irish businesses to network with potential African partners.  In 2012, over 230 participants attended the Forum including representatives from 23 African countries and over 160 Irish business interests.  At the first Forum, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade launched the Africa Strategy - Ireland and Africa: Our Partnership with a Changing Continent.  The Strategy recognises the imperative to move beyond aid and to develop deeper political, economic and trade relations.  Today, over 170 Irish companies are currently doing business in South Africa and employing over 13,000 people locally.  In West Africa, Irish companies now employ more than 15,000 people directly.  This is a sign of real and positive change in the extent and nature of our relationship with Africa.  The Third Africa Ireland Economic Forum has already created great interest, building on the positive energy unleashed by the two earlier Fora.

Both sides hold sharply different historical interpretations of these events.  In 2009 there were signs of possible improvement in the difficult relationship with the signature of protocols in which Armenia and Turkey agreed to establish diplomatic relations and open their common border.  It was envisaged as part of the process of reconciliation to refer the question of the 1915 events to a Joint Commission on historical issues.  However, the protocols were not ratified by either party.  The non- ratification of the 2009 protocols was a lost opportunity not only for Armenia and Turkey but for the entire region.  As we know in Ireland the process of reconciliation and coming to terms with the past is never easy.  As Turkey is a candidate country for EU membership and Armenia is an Eastern Partner, soon to sign an historic Association Agreement with the EU, the opportunity to move forward on this may present itself again and I would urge both sides to take advantage of any opportunity for progress for the good of their people, the region, and their shared future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500074#WRF02900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Issues","counter":292,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500074#WRF02950"},{"type":"question","counter":293,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[28700\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500074#WRF03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has concerns regarding the accusation of the PSNI favouring one community over another in Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":294,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[28702\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500074#WRF03100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on whether there has been full devolution of policing matters in Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":295,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[28706\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500074#WRF03200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has concerns that there are leaders in Sinn F&eacute;in in Northern Ireland that say they have lost confidence in policing in Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":296,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[28707\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500074#WRF03300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the fact that there are leaders in the DUP that say they have concerns regarding policing in Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":297,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 172, 173, 175 and 176 together.<\/p><p>  Under the terms of the Good Friday and Weston Park agreements, policing and criminal justice powers in Northern Ireland were devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly in April 2010.  As a result the new Department of Justice in Northern Ireland now has responsibility for policing and justice issues.  The completion of the devolution of policing and justice marked an important milestone in fulfilling the full vision of the Good Friday Agreement and closed the circle in the transformation of policing structures in Northern Ireland.  All those involved in transforming policing and in changing attitudes around policing can be very proud of the changed service they have built and the new culture of policing.<\/p><p>  More than a decade on from the Patten Report, authority and responsibility for policing and justice issues are now where they ought to be &ndash; at the local level, accountable to, and operating for the benefit of all in the community.  In the spirit of Patten, the PSNI is a police service, not a police force, part of the framework of society in the north.  One of the hallmarks of the new service is independent oversight which is exercised by the Policing Board and guarantees public confidence in the new arrangements.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s decision to join the Policing Board ensures their participation in these new arrangements and their voice, as is the voice of all political parties, is rightly heard.<\/p><p>  I have had frequent contact with the party leaders within the Northern Ireland Executive on policing and related issues in the context of the overall situation in Northern Ireland.  I have assured them that the Government remains fully engaged in our support of the work of the PSNI.  I was particularly impressed by the recent PSNI led cross community conference initiative which was held in Cardiff to promote improved community and policing relations.  Initiatives such as this are very welcome as we head into the Summer marching season.<\/p><p>  The persistence of sectarianism in Northern Ireland, with the absence of political agreement on how to make progress towards a truly reconciled society, contributes to the likelihood of incidents such as those we have witnessed in recent weeks.  While we continue to work in support of efforts to address the root causes of sectarianism, it is vital that the rule of law is respected and that the PSNI is fully supported in implementing the rule of law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500074#WRF03400","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[28704\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500074#WRF03500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the new party NI 21 in Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":300,"content":"<p>The political party NI21 was launched on 6 June, 2013 at a public event in Belfast.

Revenue takes every opportunity to remind motorists and the public generally that, in addition to its impact on the exchequer and legitimate trade, they should be aware of the risks posed to their vehicles by using laundered fuel and the fact that sourcing fuel in this way is funding criminal activity.  Revenue has made action against fuel laundering one of its priorities and is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem.  This strategy included strengthening the licensing conditions for auto-fuel traders in 2011 and the introduction of a new licensing system for marked fuel traders last October.  In addition, since January, all licensed fuel traders are required to make electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions each month.  These measures are designed to make it difficult for fuel criminals to source marked fuel for laundering and to get laundered product onto the market.  Analysis of the monthly returns of fuel trading will enable Revenue to identify suspicious or anomalous fuel transactions and patterns of distribution.  Analysis of the first few months of returns data is well advanced and traders involved in suspicious activity will be investigated and if they are unable to account properly for the source or disposal of product will face revocation of their licence, tax assessment and prosecution where appropriate. <\/p><p>  In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding in May 2012 on a joint approach to finding a more effective marker for use in both jurisdictions.  A number of proposals for a new marker submitted in response to an Invitation to Make Submissions are currently being evaluated.  The outcome of this process is expected later this year.<\/p><p>  Revenue, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, continues to intensify enforcement action against fuel fraud.  Revenue's strategy has already yielded significant results to date.  In the past two years 97 filling stations throughout the State were closed for breaches of licensing conditions.  Since the beginning of 2010, over 2.5 million<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>  litres of fuel have been seized and 29 oil laundries detected and closed down, including five oil laundries in 2013 to date.   <\/p><p>  I strongly support the work of Revenue in tackling diesel laundering and a critical step in tackling this trade is to close down the supply chain and the retail outlets that sell washed diesel. Revenue has worked closely with the industry in developing and implementing its current strategy.  <\/p><p>  The legitimate retail trade can also contribute to closing down this illegitimate trade by providing information on the outlets that are selling washed diesel. Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group (HEMG) and has established Regional sub-groups of the HEMG to facilitate the reporting of information by traders through their representative associations. Retailers who suspect or have evidence that laundered diesel is being sold in their area should report this through their representative associations to the Revenue.  Such reports are treated as confidential and are fully investigated by Revenue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500075#WRG00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500075#WRG00950"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[30652\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500075#WRG01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he intends to take further steps on the treatment of private pensions, specifically with regards to the way they are taxed, for example, if he will look for pension tax reliefs to be standardised; for the earnings ceiling to be further capped; of increasing the imputed distribution rates from super pensions such as ARFs.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":319,"content":"<p>I indicated in my Budget 2013 speech that further changes in the tax treatment of supplementary pension arrangements for higher earners would be introduced next year.

Alterations to the annual limits for tax-relieved pension contributions which are governed by an annual earnings limit in conjunction with age-related percentage limits would be one option for change, among others.<\/p><p>  As regards Approved Retirement Funds or ARFs, I should point out that ARFs are not super pensions.  ARFs represent a flexible alternative to the purchase of a pension annuity in drawing down pension benefits at retirement.  ARFs are available, subject to certain conditions, to all individuals with Defined Contribution pension arrangements and my understanding is that the bulk of ARF owners have ARFs of modest value.<\/p><p>  An annual imputed distribution rate of 5% applies to ARFs with asset values of &euro;2 million or less and to &lsquo;vested&rsquo; Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs where benefits have commenced) on the same basis.

The deemed or imputed distribution measure is designed to encourage draw-downs from ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs so that they are used, as intended, to fund a stream of income in retirement in the same way as a retirement annuity.  The measure, in itself, does not give rise to significant tax revenues as it does not apply to actual draw-downs from ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs, which are taxed in the normal way.  Moreover, increasing the annual percentage notional distribution for ARFs and &quot;vested&quot; PRSAs as suggested in the question would further increase the risk that the retirement income derived by the owners from such funds could be depleted before death.\t<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500075#WRG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tobacco Smuggling","counter":320,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500075#WRG01150"},{"type":"question","counter":321,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[30842\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500075#WRG01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of successful prosecutions that have been made for the supply of illegally obtained cigarettes and tobacco; the average length of sentence or fine for any successful prosecution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1007","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":322,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they view the illicit trade in tobacco products as a very serious matter and that combating this illegal activity is a high priority for them.

The relief will be withdrawn if the agricultural property is sold or compulsorily acquired within six years of or, in certain circumstances, ten years of the gift or inheritance unless the proceeds are reinvested in other agricultural property.<\/p><p>  The overall position as regards CAT is therefore, that parents can transfer a family farm with a market value of up to &euro;2,250,000 to a child without any charge to CAT arising on the transfer, (assuming the child qualifies as a &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; under the 80% assets test) as the market value of the agricultural lands transferred would be reduced by 90% to &euro;225,000 &ndash; this is the Group A threshold for transfers from parent to child for CAT purposes &ndash;  to leave no CAT payable.<\/p><p>  (This assumes that the child has received no prior gifts or inheritances from his or her parents).  <\/p><p>  The fact that farms with a market value of up to &euro;2,250,000 can be transferred to a child without any charge to CAT arising reflects the Governments recognition of the central importance of agriculture to the overall economy and to the sustaining of rural communities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500076#WRH03000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Registration","counter":359,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500076#WRH03100"},{"type":"question","counter":360,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[30290\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500076#WRH03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of companies his Department and the Revenue are aware of that are incorporated here but are non-tax resident anywhere in the world.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":361,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no requirement in Irish tax law for a company to claim the status of Irish registered non-resident company.

The ECB is an independent body in which I have no role in relation to its internal deliberations. Regarding an ECB role in providing funding directly for small businesses, this falls in the realm of monetary policy. Monetary policy issues are discussed at the Governing Council and the President of the ECB communicates on behalf of the ECB. In this regard, I would note that the President addressed this issue during the April, May and June post Governing Council press conferences.   The EIB, however, has highlighted SME financing as one of its priorities. In relation to Ireland, this has been evidenced with the recent announcement of the EIB of the provision of &euro;200 million for investment in AIB for small and medium companies across Ireland. This represents the latest EIB support for SMEs in Ireland since an earlier lending programme intermediated by AIB in 2011. As part of the Management Committee visit to Ireland in April, the EIB delegation met with myself and a number of other Government Ministers including Minister Bruton, where it was highlighted that access to funding for Irish SMEs is a priority for Ireland.<\/p><p>  Since Mr Werner Hoyer's appointment as President of the EIB in 2012, there has been a deepening and widening of engagement between Ireland and the Bank. A joint High Level Working Group (HLWG) was established to identify concrete and flexible mechanisms to enhance the Bank's support for Ireland's growth agenda. The EIB and Ireland are strongly committed to working together to enhance the Bank's activity in the country and this commitment is beginning to bear results. EIB group activity in Ireland in 2012 was almost &euro;600m, representing an increase of over &euro;100m in 2012 over 2011 levels and covering a diversified range of sectors and transactions. Financing for SMEs is a key part of this, and a number of Government Departments are working closely together to ensure that Ireland secures as much funding for our SMEs as possible.<\/p><p>  Earlier this month, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills signed a &euro;100 million loan agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) to further support the Government's investment in school buildings. SMEs are likely to have significant involvement in these building projects.<\/p><p>  There have also been developments in relation to non-bank funding at European level. In December 2012 the Department of Finance hosted a High-Level Workshop on Non Bank Funding of Growth and Jobs in Europe, and the report of this event is now available on the Department's website at<i> <\/i>. <\/p><p>  Ireland is committed, during its EU Presidency and beyond, to facilitate and encourage the development of an appropriate set of policy options that will support long term financing of growth and employment in Europe, with the provision of capital to SMEs a key aspect of this.  The Irish Presidency is fully supportive of the Commission's work in this area as highlighted by the publication in March of a Green Paper on Long-Term Financing of the European Economy.  The Irish Presidency ensured that the issue of long-term financing, including non-bank funding, was discussed at the Informal ECOFIN in Europe.  It was agreed at the ECOFIN that the Economic and Financial Committee of the European Council would be asked to progress this issue.  <\/p><p>  Following a proposal made by the Irish Presidency, the EFC have decided to establish a High-Level Expert Group on Long-Term Finance and SMEs.  This group will focus its work on concrete capital market instruments to stimulate and permanently diversify SME and mid-cap financing and the financing of infrastructure projects. It will also investigate the role of multilateral and national development\/public investment institutions in catalysing private finance. The ECB, EIF and EIB are all represented on the Group.  The Group will be co-chaired by John Moran, the Secretary General of my Department and Alberto Giovannini (CEO, Unifortune) and will report back in the autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500076#WRH04200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Avoidance Issues","counter":371,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500076#WRH04300"},{"type":"question","counter":372,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[30333\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500076#WRH04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 85 of 18 June 2013, the mandate given to the official of the Revenue Commissioners appointed to sit on the EU's tax platform and the grade of the official.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":373,"content":"<p> The role of the platform is as set out in recommendation 9 of the Commission's Action Plan to strengthen the fight against tax fraud and evasion which states: \"The Commission plans to establish a Platform for Tax Good Governance composed of experts from Member States and stakeholders representatives to provide assistance in preparing its report on the application of the two Recommendations, and in its ongoing work on aggressive tax planning and good governance in tax matters.\"    The official appointed to sit on the EU's tax platform is at Assistant Secretary grade.

This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets. The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a 15% tax on the commission charged. In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers&rsquo; and remote betting intermediaries&rsquo; licences. <\/p><p>  The Betting (Amendment) Bill, which will establish the regulatory framework for the licensing regime, was published in July last year.  Since that date work has been continuing by officials of my Department and Revenue on the drawing up of a number of amendments to the Bill to strengthen enforcement measures.  It is my intention, given the number of amendments, to go back to Government in the very near future for approval to republish the Bill.  <\/p><p>  This Bill will allow for the extension of the betting duty to remote operators and will ensure that all bookmakers activities offered in the State are taxed equally.  The fact that off-shore bookmakers were not subject to the betting duty represented a competitive disadvantage to on-shore firms and also narrowed the State&rsquo;s yield from the duty.<\/p><p>  It is difficult to predict with any real accuracy the yield from the taxation of remote bookmakers and betting intermediaries as it is difficult to predict how many remote operators will apply for licensing and regulation.  However the estimated yield from the remote sector at the current 1% rate of turnover tax (and the 15% gross profit tax for remote betting intermediaries) is in the region of &euro;20 million in a full year.  The 2012 yield on traditional bookmakers was &euro;27 million.  Given that the calculation of the tax for remote betting intermediaries is based on a tax on the commission charged rather than a turnover tax it is difficult to estimate the overall impact on yield of an increase in the turnover tax for remote bookmakers at the rates outlined by the Deputy.  <\/p><p>  It is my intention to, in the first instance, broaden the tax base by including the remote operators.  Therefore I have no plans, for now, to change the way in which remote betting intermediaries are to be taxed or to consider an increase in the betting duty on bookmakers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500076#WRH05500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","counter":384,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500076#WRH05550"},{"type":"question","counter":385,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[30362\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500076#WRH05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will outline the parameters of the discussions held with Ministerial colleagues at the 3248th ECOFIN Council meeting in Luxembourg on 21 June 2013; if he will detail any agreements reached; if he will provide an update on matters discussed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":386,"content":"<p>The Ecofin Council met on 21st June 2013 and as Ireland holds the Presidency of the Council of the EU, I as the Minister for Finance chaired the meeting.

This proposal forms part of the Banking Union Proposals.   It proposes to simplify and harmonise the current DGS Directive.

However, it would not be appropriate to use this figure as the basis for making a realistic estimate of the debt service savings which would arise in 2014 if &euro;10 billion of the current cash balances were used to buy back government debt.  Any potential saving would depend on the price at which it would be possible to buy back the debt.  Any attempted large scale repurchase programme in an amount of &euro;10 billion would almost certainly result in the current market prices for Irish Government debt being bid up to much higher than their current levels. Indeed, it may not be possible to buy back such a large portion of the debt or if it is only at exorbitant prices.  Any such estimate would also depend on the specific coupons payable on the bonds, general market conditions at the time and other factors.<\/p><p>  Funds in the Exchequer are used for all the ongoing payments necessary for running the State, which include debt redemptions.  The State earns a return on these cash balances and deposits, which the NTMA manages in a prudent manner consistent with minimising risk and always having sufficient cash on hand to cover any volatility which might arise.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the progress made in stabilising and improving the public finances it remains the case that the State will continue to run large, though declining Exchequer deficits in the coming years.  For example, SPU 2013 estimated the cumulative Exchequer deficit over the years 2013-2015 at &euro;25 billion. <\/p><p>  In addition to these day-to-day costs and as referred to above, the Exchequer must have sufficient resources to repay debt redemptions, such as the forthcoming &euro;7.6 billion Government bond repayment in mid-January 2014.  The continuing Exchequer deficits and debt redemptions must be adequately and prudently funded.<\/p><p>  Decisions on the level of cash reserves take account of various factors in addition to the cost of maintaining such reserves.  These factors include the potential risks of not maintaining an adequate and prudent cash balance, including the risk that the Exchequer would be unable to meet its obligations and that market interest rates would possibly be higher than would otherwise be the case due to the perception that the State had a precarious liquidity position.<\/p><p>  The State is well positioned to have 12 to15 months of advance funding in place when the EU\/IMF Programme comes to a conclusion at the end of this year, a level of funding which the Troika have noted in their recent reports on Ireland&rsquo;s progress in implementing the terms of the Programme of assistance.

SEPA is an EU initiative that will change the way that these payments are processed across Europe.  SEPA will allow payment systems users to make euro-denominated retail electronic payments to payees located in any of the participating countries, using a single payment account and a single set of payment instruments (the participating countries are the EU member states, together with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Monaco). <\/p><p>  SEPA comes into full effect on 1 February 2014 and businesses will need to ensure that payroll, direct debit and accounting systems are SEPA-ready.  SEPA will introduce new business rules in relation to retail electronic payments and implement common standards in all participating countries for issuing and executing the underlying payment instructions.  SEPA will deliver tangible benefits to businesses, for example by allowing faster settlement and simplified processing will improve cash flow and reduce costs.<\/p><p>  The implementation of SEPA within Ireland is overseen by the National Payments Plan (NPP) Steering Committee, which was established in 2012 to modernise the way payments are made in Ireland. In this regard, an NPP-SEPA sub-group has been formed, consisting of representatives of consumers, businesses, Government and banks.  This sub group provides an avenue for the discussion of any issues that arise in the process of migrating to SEPA.<\/p><p>  The SEPA Direct Debit Scheme exists in two forms &ndash; the &lsquo;core&rsquo; scheme and the &lsquo;B2B&rsquo; (Business to Business) scheme.  Both scheme forms allow creditors to collect funds directly from a debtor&rsquo;s bank account, provided that a valid mandate has been given by the debtor to the creditor.  The key difference is that in the B2B Scheme the payer is not entitled to obtain a refund in respect of an authorised transaction (in contrast with the rights afforded to the payer in the in the core SDD scheme). <\/p><p>  Adherence to the core scheme by banks is mandatory, but provision of the B2B scheme is optional; thus far only two Irish banks are in a position to offer the SDD &lsquo;B2B&rsquo; service.  The remaining banks are currently focussed on the migration of their business customers to the SEPA &lsquo;core&rsquo; scheme in advance of the 1 February 2014 end-date.  Once this objective has been achieved, the possibility of offering the &lsquo;B2B&rsquo; scheme will be examined by these banks; this issue is currently the subject of ongoing discussion between the banks concerned and the Central Bank of Ireland. <\/p><p>  In terms of the refund rights available to payers under SEPA, these are laid down in the Payment Services Directive 2009 (the PSD) as transposed by S.I. 383 of 2009, and in the SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) scheme rulebook published by the European Payments Council (the owner of the SDD scheme). <\/p><p>  The PSD grants consumers refund rights in three situations &ndash; for overcharging, unauthorised debits and incorrect processing.  For unauthorised debits and incorrect processing, the payer has a right to an immediate refund as long as they notify their bank as soon as possible, and no later than 13 months after the debit date. <\/p><p>  In cases of overcharging, if the payer has authorised payment without the amount having been stated in advance (e.g., through a direct debit or a card payment) and the amount debited is not what could reasonably have been expected, the payer is be entitled to challenge the debit by contacting their payment services provider within eight weeks.  The payment services provider is then obliged to reimburse the payer within ten days or justify its refusal to do so.<\/p><p>  In addition to the protections available under the PSD, the SDD &lsquo;core&rsquo; scheme rules  grant payers a 'no-questions-asked' refund right during the eight weeks following the debiting of a their account.  During this time, any funds collected via the SDD &lsquo;core&rsquo; scheme will be credited back to the payer's account upon request. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500078#WRK01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":454,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500078#WRK01300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"F&Aacute;S Training Programmes","counter":453,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500078#WRK01250"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[30214\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500078#WRK01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will allow a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary to complete an apprenticeship with FAS outside this jurisdiction; if she will recognise their work outside the State for the purposes of their apprenticeship; if her attention has been drawn to the person who cannot complete their apprenticeship within the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"962","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":455,"content":"<p>I understand that the F&Aacute;S Standards Based Apprenticeship system requires an apprentice to undertake seven alternating phases of training and work experience with a company that is based in the Republic of Ireland and that is approved to train apprentices.

Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, I have attempted to take steps to reduce the burden on families. Shortly after coming into office I met with members of the Irish Educational Publishers' Association and impressed on them the need to limit the cost of textbooks. I have also stressed to them the real need to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.<\/p><p>  The Association responded positively to my approaches and agreed a voluntary Code of Practice among their members.  The Code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years.  The publishers have also given assurances to me that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes.  All these developments are welcome, and I look forward to seeing the members of the Association implement these commitments. <\/p><p>  The Department provided approximately &euro;15m in total to first and second level schools by way of book grants in 2012 and the same level of funding will be provided in 2013.  As the Deputy may be aware I launched new &quot;Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools&quot; on the 28th January last.  These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.  The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.<\/p><p>  The publication of these Guidelines follows a survey of schools by the Department, and which I published in May 2012.  This had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme. At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%.  Of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community &amp;amp; Comprehensive sector operated a book rental scheme. <\/p><p>  I believe these results show that we have a good foundation to build on across the country.  I hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the Guidelines to introduce them.  If they do, it will result in substantial savings for parents. Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books. <\/p><p>  A special &quot;Guide for Parents&quot; was also published, to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them.  I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes.  All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden it places on already hard pressed families at the start of every school year.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to see the high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary level and I believe that these Guidelines will encourage this practice across all schools in our education landscape. <\/p><p>  I also published a Report on Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and the Allocation of Textbook Grants by the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills in May 2012.  This report presented four policy options to encourage schools to establish textbook rental schemes.  None of the options are ideal, each one involves a trade-off of advantages and disadvantages.  I will continue to monitor the number of schools operating book rental schemes, and if it proves necessary consider further steps to encourage schools to do so.<\/p><p>  Educational book publishers are independent private companies not under the direct control of my Department.  Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second-level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on textbooks are taken at school level.  Individual schools need to adopt a more cost-conscious approach to the selection of books in their classes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500078#WRK03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500078#WRK03250"},{"type":"question","counter":485,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[30118\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500078#WRK03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans for the development of a school (details supplied) in County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1067","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":486,"content":"<p>The Major Building Project referred to by the Deputy\u00a0is currently at an early Stage of Architectural Planning.

As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS).<\/p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that as each child's identified needs should determine the teaching approach and methodology that is to be used. As children differ significantly from one another and as children's needs vary and change over time, it is not possible to impose a method or approach that will work for all children with autism. The research evidence is clear that no matter what exclusive approach is followed, its success is limited. Different approaches have been applied successfully with different children, and each approach has been shown to have limitations. This is why my Department does not establish schools to follow an exclusive approach including ABA.<\/p><p>  My Department funded an ABA pilot scheme between 1999 and 2010.  The participating centres were not closed, rather all 13 of them applied to my Department for recognition as special schools.  Irish Autism Action (IAA) represented the centres in the lengthy discussions with my officials which resulted in the schools being granted recognition win 2010. The schools, all of which employ staff with ABA qualifications, currently operate in line with my Department's policy.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware of the Middletown Centre for Autism which is an initiative jointly funded between my Department and the Department of Education in Northern Ireland. The Centre is aimed at supporting the promotion of excellence in the development and harmonisation of education and allied services to children and young people with autistic spectrum disorders.  The Centre provides parenting classes nationwide and I have recently committed to expanding the centre to increase the successful parenting programme.<\/p><p>  My Department's child centred policy is based on advice received from NEPS; the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism and takes full account of advice from a range of experts on autism, including persons with expertise and qualifications in ABA. Advice was sought from international experts on research provided by the IAA and other research on educational interventions for children with autistic spectrum disorders and the advice concluded that research does not support the exclusive usage of ABA or indeed the exclusive use of any other approach, as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism. It is for this reason that my Department's preferred policy is for a child centred approach where the approach to be taken is based on the individual child's needs.   My Department remains willing to review and consider any further research as and when it becomes available and my officials are conscious of the need to adapt existing policies and to develop new policies as new research or learning becomes available.<\/p><p>  The National Council for Special Education has a formal role under Section 20.1(j) of EPSEN to advise the Minister 'in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities'. I have now requested the NCSE to prepare Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.   A feature of the preparation of this impartial advice will involve NCSE consulting widely with parents, professionals and other stakeholders and interested parties.<\/p><p>  The NCSE have commissioned research which will not be finalised until mid to late 2014 and I expect that this research will inform much of the work in preparing the policy advice. Accordingly it is not expected that the report will be finalised until early 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500082#WRO00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Applications","counter":668,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500082#WRO00850"},{"type":"question","counter":669,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[30846\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500082#WRO00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason for the delay in the processing by Student Universal Support Ireland of additional information, in this case an invoice for the cost of an educational course of a person (details supplied) in County Galway which has caused the grant application to be erroneously considered in the appeals process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":670,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department have confirmed with Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) that the student referred to by the Deputy has been awarded a grant and an award letter issued on 11th March, 2013.

We are bringing public expenditure back onto a sustainable path and driving forward the Public Service reform agenda to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort which is essential to achieving our annual deficit targets.  To date, all quantitative fiscal targets set as part of the EU\/IMF Programme of Financial Support have been met in full.<\/p><p>  Reform of the Public Service is a critical component of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to restore the public finances to sustainability, while ensuring that we continue to deliver essential services as efficiently and effectively as possible. It is for this reason that the comprehensive and far-reaching suite of reforms we have set out in the Public Service Reform Plan, published November 2011, are being implemented.<\/p><p>  The reform process is delivering real savings, as demonstrated in the reports published by the independent Implementation Body established to monitor progress under the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 (the Croke Park Agreement). The First Progress Report of the Implementation Body found that some &euro;308 million in non-pay administrative efficiency savings were made between July 2010 and March 2011. The Second Progress Report of the Implementation Body found that non-pay administrative efficiency savings of &euro;370 million were made in the period April 2011 to March 2012. These savings are in addition to the substantial savings on the Public Service pay bill identified by the Implementation Body. The third Progress Report of the Implementation Body, covering the nine month period April 2012 to December 2012, will be published shortly and will show that further substantial savings were realised through efficiency improvements over this period.<\/p><p>  Under the Public Service Reform Plan, an ambitious range of reform measures are being rolled out in areas such as shared services, public procurement and eGovernment and will enable Departments to meet their reduced budgetary allocations.<\/p><p>  In addition, the measures set out in the Haddington Road Agreement will enable the Government to achieve the targeted savings of approximately &euro;300 million in the public service pay and pensions bill in 2013, including savings on Local Government. Furthermore, it is estimated that the measures set out in the Haddington Road Agreement will reduce the public service pay and pensions bill by &euro;1 billion by the end of the Agreement.<\/p><p>  Of course, reform is needed not just to deliver on our fiscal targets but also to ensure that the State can continue to provide essential services in the face of falling staff numbers and reduced spending budgets. For that reason, Public Service reform will continue to be a key component of our overall strategic response to the economic situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500082#WRO02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":694,"content":"<p>Question No. 317 answered with Question No. 311.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Procurement Service Framework Agreements","counter":695,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500082#WRO02850"},{"type":"question","counter":696,"qnumday":318,"qnumall":"[30198\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500082#WRO02900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if a directive has been issued to primary and post-primary schools requiring that they purchase all stationery\/paper from an Office of Public Works selected company, identified through the public procurement process or may they purchase from local suppliers using best value for money; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1108","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":697,"content":"<p>The National Procurement Service (NPS) is focused on developing centralised arrangements for the procurement of goods and services used commonly across the public service nationwide.

The primary purpose of the Bill is to introduce amendments to the current legislation which underpins the rateable valuation system on which commercial rates are calculated by rating authorities. The proposed amendments to the Valuation Act 2001 are designed to accelerate the valuation process and include new features which provide for the streamlining of the valuation appeals procedures available to ratepayers. As part of the efforts to accelerate the revaluation process, the legislation will also provide the legislative basis for carrying out a revaluation based on self-assessment by ratepayers and also for the external delivery of elements of the valuation process. <\/p><p>  The national revaluation programme aims to provide up-to-date valuations for individual properties across all economic sectors that are subject to local authority rates. It is an important programme, especially given the significant changes that have occurred in rental values following the economic downturn of recent years. The revaluation process is the mechanism whereby economic changes that take place in the property market are reflected in the valuation lists for rates purposes and in individual ratepayers&rsquo; rates liabilities. <\/p><p>  Under Irish law, there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The Valuation Act, 2001 sets out the procedures and basis for assessing the valuation of properties for rates purposes. The Act does not deal with liability for rates, including the ability or otherwise of ratepayers to pay the rates, which is an area covered in rating and local government law and which falls outside the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Valuation. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority and do not come within the remit of the valuation system which is solely concerned with the determination of property valuations. Therefore, it is not proposed to include a provision in the Valuation (Amendment) (No.2) Bill, 2012 which would affect the operation of the rates collection system.<\/p><p>  With regard to the possibility of introducing an element of self-assessment by ratepayers to the valuation process, the Commissioner of Valuation has concluded that this may be a viable option and is arranging for a pilot scheme to test this methodology in one rating authority area. However, for the pilot to proceed, a suitable amendment to the Valuation Act, 2001 is required and therefore, it is proposed in the amending legislation to provide the statutory basis which will allow the Commissioner to initiate such a pilot scheme, which if it proves successful could be extended to other rating authority areas as part of the strategy to expedite the delivery of the revaluation programme.<\/p><p>  The current national revaluation programme will result in all rateable properties in all rating authority areas across the State being revalued. The criteria for the sequencing of rating authority areas for revaluation and in particular the selection of the three rating authority areas in Waterford, i.e. Waterford City Council; Waterford County Council and Dungarvan Town Council was based on a number of factors such as the relevant size of the jurisdictions of the rating authorities, the number and concentration of rateable items in a rural\/urban setting and the range of industrial and commercial properties which would be generally representative of all economic business sectors. The degree of interface and overlap of the three rating authorities was also a relevant factor as it was considered prudent to carry out a revaluation simultaneously in all these rating areas as the City of Waterford straddles a large rural hinterland which if it was not revalued as part of the programme would have resulted in the creation of certain valuation anomalies at the border interface between the City and County. Once a decision was made to revalue all commercial and industrial properties in Waterford City and County, it would have been incongruous to exclude the properties in the Dungarvan Town Council area from the programme. <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s Action Programme for Effective Local Government, Putting People First, indicates that in the context of reorganisation of local governance structures, the proposed new municipal districts will provide an opportunity to achieve a more coherent approach to rates and charges on a county-wide basis, having regard to funding requirements and the need to support employment and business competitiveness.  <\/p><p>  The Action Programme proposes rates harmonisation to cater for differences between Annual Rates on Valuation (ARVs) of towns and counties.  The approach of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to rates harmonisation will seek to ensure, that harmonisation does not lead to significant net loss of revenue in individual counties with consequential implications for services, and that any change in rates does not impact negatively on businesses and employment.  It is important that local government reform drives down costs to business in order to protect existing jobs and sustain our economic competitiveness. <\/p><p>  Definitive details, arrangements and procedures in relation to the funding of district level functions, and financial relationships between district and county levels, will be developed in the context of the new local government funding arrangements generally, implementation of the new sub-county system and preparation of the legislation in relation to the reform programme.<\/p><p>  In keeping with the principle of separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates the imposition of limits on the amount of rates that a rating authority can raise is generally a matter for decision by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and does not come within the competence of the Commissioner of Valuation whose sole responsibility lies in administering the system of rateable valuation as underpinned by the Valuation Act, 2001. However, in so far as the valuation legislation is concerned, there is a specific provision in the 2001 Act which allows the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to make an order requiring a rating authority to exercise its powers to make rates in such a manner that it does not exceed the amount of rates liable to be paid to it in the first year following a revaluation except for any increase determined by the consumer price index.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500083#WRP01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":725,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500083#WRP01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consumer Protection","counter":724,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500083#WRP01750"},{"type":"question","counter":725,"qnumday":330,"qnumall":"[30073\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500083#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the protections that are in place for persons who purchase products and services from door-to-door salespersons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":726,"content":"<p>The main statutory protections for consumers who purchase goods and services from door-to-door salespersons are to be found in the European Communities (Cancellation of Contracts Negotiated Away From Business Premises) Regulations 1989 (S.I.

No 59 of 2012,  provides only that there is legal clarity confirming  the availability of  injunctive relief by the Courts where copyright infringement is alleged. This S.I.  would not of itself impact on, or be in any way contradictory with cases and judgements arising from that legislation.<\/p><p>  In general, the situation in relation to online intermediaries and copyright infringement is that, in certain circumstances, intermediaries are protected from liability arising from their activities involving the hosting, caching of online content or, of acting as a mere conduit of such content.  Furthermore, they  may not be required to engage in general monitoring on their networks.  Under EU Copyright law, as transposed into national law, the owner of copyright in a work may, in respect of that work, apply to the High Court for an injunction against the intermediary whose services are used by a third party to infringe that copyright.<\/p><p>  The Court of Justice of the EU has given guidelines in relation to the granting of such injunctions and has stated that the protection of the fundamental right to property which includes copyright, must be balanced fairly against the protection of other fundamental rights, such as the right to conduct a business and the rights of individuals who may be affected by interference in their rights to protection of their personal data  or their rights to freedom to receive or impart information.<\/p><p>  The Court has pointed also to the need to consider circumstances in which the granting of an injunction could potentially lead to unnecessary cost such as the need to install systems to distinguish adequately between lawful and unlawful content with the result that its introduction could lead to the blocking of lawful communications and that the question of whether a transmission is lawful depends also on the application of statutory exceptions under copyright which vary from Member State to Member State.<\/p><p>  Thus, the issues raised indicate the complexity of what is involved in such cases which extends also to those within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources who has overall responsibility for electronic communications and internet policy in general.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500083#WRP02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":741,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500083#WRP02950"},{"type":"question","counter":742,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[30356\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500083#WRP03000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will outline the proposals he has tabled to protect the beef sector within the European Union in the event of a EU\/US Trade Agreement being formalised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":743,"content":"<p>The report of the EU-US High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth was published on 11 February this year. The Group recommended significantly closer trade relations between the two economies of the EU and the US. It reported on the opportunities for mutually beneficial job creation, economic growth and international competitiveness that would follow from a comprehensive EU - US trade and investment agreement. These opportunities are truly significant, leading to an increase in EU GDP of up to 0.5% for an ambitious and comprehensive final agreement.<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Following considerable preparatory work by the Irish Presidency and intensive discussions at the EU's Trade Council that I chaired on 14 June, EU Trade Ministers agreed negotiating directives that will enable the Commission to formally open detailed talks on this Agreement.<\/font>  The negotiating mandate is broad based and positions the Commission to enter the talks with strong support from the Council to negotiate the best possible deal for Europe. The mandate includes three key components: market access; regulatory issues and non-tariff barriers; and the rules which will govern the operation of any dispute settlement. The scale of opportunity for economic growth and job creation from this agreement are potentially enormous. The TTIP will be the largest bilateral agreement ever negotiated and offers significant opportunity to help our exporters and especially SMEs access the huge US market for goods and services. Studies suggest that 2 million jobs could be created across the developed economies of the OECD if we successfully conclude an agreement that is comprehensive and deeply liberalises the transatlantic marketplace. <\/p><p>  The negotiations on this trade agreement have not yet commenced; the first round is set to take place in Washington on 8 July.  Consequently it is not possible to quantify either the extent of any US requests for access to the EU market, or the necessary trade off involved in respect of market access in the agriculture sector more broadly or the beef segment in particular. Nevertheless the negotiating directives agreed at the Trade Council on 14 June do include provisions that aim to improve animal welfare as well as ensuring that important issues for consumers, such as continuing restrictions or prohibitions on hormone treated fed food products as well as GMOs will not be changed. <\/p><p>  The High Level Working Group recommended the phasing out of substantially all tariffs for all but the most sensitive tariffs. I have supported my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in recognising the beef sector as a sensitive sector of importance for Ireland. As I have done previously in other trade negotiations, I will continue to look for the most advantageous outcome from this trade and investment agreement with the US that promotes our vital economic interests, and that includes the special interests of the beef sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500083#WRP03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Copyright Legislation Review","counter":744,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500083#WRP03150"},{"type":"question","counter":745,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[30483\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500083#WRP03200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"when the Copyright Review Committee will make its recommendations as per its terms of reference established in May 2011.","asker":"1018","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":746,"content":"<p>An independent Copyright Review Committee was established in May 2011 to examine the Irish copyright and legislative framework to identify areas that might be deemed to create barriers to innovation and to make recommendations to resolve any problems identified. <\/p><p>  The Committee conducted an initial consultation during the summer of 2011 and received submissions from a broad spectrum of interested parties.

That Article provides, in effect, that the exclusive power to make laws is vested in the Oireachtas. The Supreme Court took the view that Registered Employment Agreements are instruments having the status of laws made by private individuals subject only to a limited power of veto by a subordinate body<font color=\"#FF0000\">.<\/font>   While the Constitution allows for the limited delegation of law making functions, the provisions of the 1946 Act went beyond what is permissible under the Constitution. <\/p><p>  The effect of this decision is to invalidate the registration of employment agreements previously registered under Part III of the 1946 Act. In consequence the Labour Court no longer has jurisdiction to enforce, interpret or otherwise apply these agreements. <\/p><p>  As a result, all such agreements no longer have any application beyond the subscribing parties and are not enforceable in law.  However, existing contractual rights of workers in sectors covered by Registered Employment Agreements are unaffected by the ruling.

In addition, there were over 50 employment agreements covering individual enterprises that had been registered by the Court under the 1946 Act.<\/p><p>  The striking down of the REAs means that new employees in these sectors can now be hired at a rate agreeable between workers and their employers. This is subject only to the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000.<\/p><p>  From the parties' perspective, the primary objective of REAs is to provide them with a sense of certainty around terms and conditions that will apply when the employer is tendering for and working through contracts and to have in place agreed grievance and industrial peace provisions.

While the methods used in the survey can be questioned (e.g. door-to-door surveys can capture less employed people as they are more likely to be out at work) and recent Live Register figures show that there has been a 4.8% decrease in the numbers signing on in Ballyfermot in the past twelve months, the Government recognises that unemployment black spots exist in specific areas across the country and need to be addressed. Also, people who are not working but who are also unavailable for work such as students and carers may be classified as unemployed.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s approach to tackling the unemployment problem is to focus resources on those individuals most at risk of long-term unemployment. <\/p><p>  Up to the recent past, this has been based on identifying all persons who remain on the Live Register for three months after first signing on, and referring them for more intensive job-search assistance and guidance. Increasingly, referral is now based on profiling people at the beginning of a spell of unemployment, so as to focus resources on those most in need at an even earlier stage. <\/p><p>  By definition, such an approach focuses resources on those areas where unemployment is highest and of longest duration. The roll-out of the profiling system at my Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; Intreo offices will further enhance this effect as one of the main variables in the profiling system is geographical location. In other words, if someone comes from an area of high unemployment, s\/he will, all other things being equal, receive more targeted assistance.<\/p><p>  In addition, the geographical distribution of places on employment programmes such as CE and T&uacute;s &amp;amp; training programmes has been highly correlated with unemployment rates for each region. Within the T&uacute;s programme there is a specific area-based approach to the allocation of places. The 5,000 places on the scheme are allocated to community and voluntary organisations involved in the delivery of local services in urban and rural areas. The allocation is based on the numbers of eligible unemployed people in each local development company or &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta area.<\/p><p>  Other than through administrative mechanisms like those described, it is difficult to identify and target specific unemployment black spots at a very local level. The most frequent unemployment data come from the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS); as a sample survey, the QNHS provides reliable data at a regional, but not at a local level. Small-area statistics are collected in the Census, but these are available only at five-year intervals, and the unemployment concept underlying them does not correspond exactly with that used in the QNHS.<\/p><p>  However, the Government&rsquo;s policy of targeting resources at those most at risk of long-term unemployment overcomes this statistical deficit and ensures those areas that are most in need of assistance are prioritised. My Department works primarily at a local level and is acutely aware of the differentiated impact of unemployment across local areas. The Department has 59 local offices, 63 branch offices and newly incorporated employment offices. The Live Register figures by office are closely monitored and are an important consideration for the provision of our activation services.<\/p><p>  In terms of job creation, the Action Plan for Jobs recognises the need for a concerted effort by Government and contains 333 actions to be implemented this year by 16 Government Departments and 46 agencies.  The original Action Plan for Jobs sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016.  In addition, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 includes the Pathways to Work initiative&rsquo;s targets for increasing the number of people who are long-term unemployed moving into employment and reducing the average length of time spent on the Live Register. <\/p><p>  Specifically, these targets are that:<\/p><p>  (i) at least 75,000 of those currently long-term unemployed will move into employment by 2015. <\/p><p>  (ii) Increase the exit rate of people on the  live register  for two years or more by 50%  (to 40%)  by the end of 2015 <\/p><p>  (iii) Reduce the persistence rate (the rate at which short term unemployed people become long term unemployed) to 25%. <\/p><p>  These targets are particularly relevant for unemployment black spots with a high prevalence of long-term unemployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500084#WRQ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax and Social Welfare Codes","counter":772,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500084#WRQ01750"},{"type":"question","counter":773,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[30008\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500084#WRQ01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to introduce the second tier of child income support payment reform without abolishing family income supplement as suggested by the End Child Poverty Coalition.","asker":"969","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":774,"content":"<p>In line with commitments contained in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare in June 2011, with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to examine a number of specific issues. These include making cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes. <\/p><p>  The Group commenced its work programme by prioritising the area of family and child income supports and its report on this first module of work was published in February. The report makes important recommendations as to how child benefit could be maintained as a universal payment while reforming the current system of child and family income supports through a two-tier payment so as to better target those who need these supports most while minimising work disincentives.  Under this two-tier payment approach, the Advisory Group suggests rebalancing and integrating child and family income support payments as follows:<\/p><p>  A universal first-tier payment in respect of all children, which would replace the current child benefit payment<\/p><p>  A child income support supplement or second-tier payment for low-income families, which would replace the current qualified child increases components on all Social Protection weekly payments as well as the family income supplement (FIS). This second-tier payment would be proportionately reduced as income increases and would be withdrawn for families on a higher income. <\/p><p>  Given also the range of complex issues involved with this proposal, including fiscal, operational and legal considerations, as well as the implications for reforms in terms of child poverty and employment incentive outcomes, the Government has made no decision at this time on the core recommendations of the report.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the report will now contribute to the broader policy debate on this important issue for families and their children.<\/p><p>  The response of the End Child Poverty Coalition to the Advisory Group&rsquo;s report on child and family income supports has been submitted to my Department. I also recently met with representatives of the Coalition to discuss their submission and listened to their views with interest as part of the overall consultation process on this report.   With regard to the End Child Poverty Coalition&rsquo;s proposals relating to FIS, it should be noted that the Advisory Group&rsquo;s report acknowledges that this payment has a dual role not only as a child income support but also as an in-work support for parents on low incomes.

The estimated expenditure on child benefit in 2013 is around &euro;1.9 billion and it is currently paid to around 613,000 families in respect of some 1.17 million children. The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, can be an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment.<\/p><p>  Child benefit is paid monthly in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and in respect of children over 16 years of age up to their 18th birthday who are in full time education or have a disability. The current age limit was set under Budget 2009 when the upper age limit that applied then was reduced from 19 years to 18 years with effect from 2010.<\/p><p>  There are currently no plans for extending the upper age limit for child benefit. In any event, any plans to change the upper age limit could only be decided in a budgetary context.<\/p><p>  For families on low incomes there are a number of provisions to social welfare schemes which support children in full-time education until the age of 22. These include:<\/p><p> - Qualified child increases to primary social welfare payments in receipt of either:<\/p><p>(a) A long-term social welfare payment, or<\/p><p>(b) A short-term social welfare payment including such payments as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and assistance, illness benefit and supplementary welfare allowance.<\/p><p> - The family income supplement (FIS) scheme to low paid employees with families. This supplement is paid where a family&rsquo;s weekly income is below a specified amount for the family size, and is calculated at 60% of the difference between the net family income (i.e. gross pay less tax, PRSI, USC, superannuation) and the relevant income limit.<\/p><p> - The back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when children start school each autumn.<\/p><p>  On a more general level, the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on family and child income supports makes important recommendations as to how child benefit could be maintained as a universal payment while reforming the current system of child and family income supports through a two-tier payment so as to better target those who need these supports most while minimising work disincentives. Given a range of complex issues involved with this proposal, including fiscal, operational and legal considerations, as well as the implications for reforms in terms of child poverty and employment incentive outcomes, the Government has made no decision at this time on the core recommendations of the report.  It is the Government's intention that the report will now contribute to the broader policy debate on this important issue for families and their children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500085#WRR00400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illness Benefit Appeals","counter":806,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500085#WRR00500"},{"type":"question","counter":807,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[30126\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500085#WRR00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the progress made to date in respect of an appeal for illness benefit in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Meath; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":808,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 30<sup>th<\/sup> May 2013, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500085#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Appeals","counter":809,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500085#WRR00800"},{"type":"question","counter":810,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[30129\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500085#WRR00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if the deciding officers in appeal cases have experience or training in disability issues.","asker":"1017","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":811,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office is independently responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

Should they still have an income support need, they will be required to apply for another social welfare income support payment from my Department. In order to qualify for another social welfare payment they must first meet the conditionality associated with that payment. It is worth noting that lone parents have always had to make the transition from OFP to another social welfare payment, as entitlement to OFP has always been based on the age of their youngest child.<\/p><p>  For lone parents who will lose their entitlement to the OFP payment from 4 July, 2013 and who have a youngest child aged 14 years or over, as is the case with the client in question, a number of alternative options to the OFP payment are available.  These customers can apply for the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA), with the full conditionality of that scheme applied.  This includes satisfying the scheme rule whereby JA is payable only where a person is fully unemployed for four out of any seven days.  In situations where the working patterns of these customers do not conform to this rule, other options are offered.  They may be able to re-organise their current hours of employment to satisfy the JA scheme conditionality or secure an increase in their working hours in order to qualify for the family income supplement (FIS) &ndash; which requires individuals to work a minimum of 19 hours per week.  <\/p><p>  If they are unable to meet either the JA or FIS scheme rules, and if they continue to have an income support need, they may have recourse to the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA), which, subject to satisfying a means test, is paid at &euro;2 lower than the basic rate of the OFP payment (&euro;186 per week compared to &euro;188 per week - respectively) but which has the same additional increases for each qualified child (&euro;29.80 per week per child).<\/p><p>  My Department is in contact with customers whose OFP payment is due to end to advise them of their options and I understand that this has included the person referred to in the Deputy's question. <\/p><p>  The current reforms to the OFP scheme are essential to achieve the necessary progressive outcomes for lone parents and their children &ndash; who are over-represented, compared to other social groups, in terms of poverty risk.

The conservation imperative means that exploitation of salmon of each river is only permitted where the independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) for Salmon determine that the stock in that river is above the Conservation Limit (CL).<\/p><p>I can also inform the Deputy that the genetic data for the Bride indicates that the salmon population is similar to, but not identical to, the Blackwater.  The Bride is a substantial river catchment with an average declared rod catch over the 2002-2006 period of 79 salmon.  Therefore the SSC assess the Bride as a fishery in its own right and advice is provided on that basis. On the contrary the other tributaries (the Glenshelane and Finnisk) are small catchments with an average of zero and one salmon recorded respectively in the rod catch over the 2002-2006 period.  This fact and the fact that genetic analysis indicates no evidence that the salmon populations in these tributaries and the salmon populations in the main Blackwater are different from a biodiversity perspective means they do not warrant separate management.<\/p><p>The Bride was open for angling over the 2003-2006 period and the reported catch is set out in the table following.  Rod catches were low and the estimated salmon run was below the then Bride CL of 1,379 salmon and consequently the river was closed for angling from 2007 onwards.<\/p><p>Further analysis was carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland through the use of catchment wide electro-fishing in the Bride in 2008 and 2010 to determine juvenile salmon fry abundance.  This gave an average of 17.55 salmon fry over both years, indicating good salmon spawning activity.  These results enabled the SSC to recommend that the river re-open for catch and release angling in 2011 and 2012 and thereby generate additional rod catch information on the likely salmon run.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on ComReg's website at .<\/p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme.

The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU's target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland's National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.<\/p><p>  In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. <\/p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  A comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector is being undertaken to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband services over the coming years.<\/p><p>  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment so as to deliver on the targets for high speed broadband contained in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500087#WRT01300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Policy","counter":932,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500087#WRT01350"},{"type":"question","counter":933,"qnumday":402,"qnumall":"[30739\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500087#WRT01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the person that owns a site (details supplied) in County Cavan; the person responsible for maintaining this site; if the Environment Protection Agency is monitoring this site and any emissions that may come from the drilling there; if he will outline the history of ownership and operations at this site; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":934,"content":"<p>The matters raised by the Deputy regarding ownership of a site and monitoring of environmental emissions are matters which fall outside the scope of my statutory remit.<\/p><p>  My role, pursuant to the Minerals Development Act 1960, extends to the licensing of petroleum exploration activities, including granting consent to the drilling of petroleum exploration and production wells.<\/p><p>  The Dowra 2 onshore gas exploration well was drilled in 2001 by Evergreen Resources pursuant to Licence ON2\/01.<\/p><p>  In drilling Dowra 2, Evergreen employed standard oil industry drilling and testing processes and the well was drilled in accordance with my Department's Rules and Procedures.<\/p><p>  The Dowra 2 well was permanently plugged and abandoned in 2003, in accordance with accepted procedures and as approved by my Department and this work was signed off by the Independent Well Examiner in June 2003.

These concerns mainly centre on data privacy rights not being adequately respected.  Commissioner Reding and myself raised these concerns with the US Attorney General Eric Holder at the EU-US Ministerial meeting last week.  I also raised the matter at a bilateral meeting which I had with Attorney General Holder.  At these meetings, the US Attorney General provided clarity on a number of issues, in particular that the information collected and processed relates only to metadata i.e. phone numbers, duration of calls etc, but not the content of calls.  He also advised that the data was collected under judicial authority and only where there was a reasonable suspicion of serious crime, such as terrorism or cybersecurity-cybercrime.  The courts only allow the data to be queried when there is a reasonable suspicion based on specific facts that the basis of the query is associated with a foreign terrorist organisation.  He further stated that Congressional oversight applied to these programmes.  It was agreed to set up a working group between the EU side and the US security services to continue dialogue in relation to this matter.<\/p><p>  We cannot ignore the very important fact that there is a recognised need to protect our citizens from terrorist threats and dealing with that does require access to certain data.  In doing so, however, it is necessary to ensure that the information used is properly obtained and subject to appropriate safeguards.  The importance of protecting individual rights to privacy and ensuring respect for individual human rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights was emphasised to the US side.  The crucial need to ensure that any security surveillance undertaken is balanced and proportionate was also emphasised as was the need to give essential assurances to non-US citizens on this score.  The US authorities have indicated that their practices are proportionate to the threat they are trying to deal with.<\/p><p>  We do have, in this country, robust data protection legislation to protect individuals against unwarranted invasion into their privacy.  Access to call content is governed by the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 and may only take place under Ministerial warrant.  Access to retained data in this jurisdiction is governed by the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011.Under the Act access may only be granted following a request to the particular mobile phone company or internet provider in connection with the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of a serious offence, the safeguarding of the security of the State or the saving of human life.  The operation of both Acts this is subject to judicial oversight and there is a complaints procedure which individuals can avail of if there is a concern that the Acts have been breached in relation to their calls or their data.  There are also procedures in place under Mutual Assistance legislation to cover requests to and from other countries for this type of information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500089#WRV00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":1037,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500089#WRV00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1038,"qnumday":436,"qnumall":"[30053\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500089#WRV00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the appropriate fee in respect of an application for naturalisation in the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 20; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1039,"content":"<p>The standard certification fee is &euro;950 while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain circumstances when the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.

The various sections of the Charities Act are subject to implementation through commencement orders.  Sections that it was possible to commence in advance of the establishment of the Charities Regulatory Authority, as provided for under the Act, have been commenced.  The remaining sections, including those relating to the provision for non-cash collections under section 93 of the Charities Act, can only be commenced following the establishment of the Authority.<\/p><p>  At present, my Department is examining options for resource efficient ways of making progress towards the objectives of the Charities Act 2009.  A public and stakeholder consultation was recently conducted by the Department on the implementation of the Act.  Issues covered in the consultation paper included the establishment of a Charities Regulatory Authority; the statutory registration of charities and granting of charitable status; and reporting requirements for registered charities.  Additional steps to regulate fundraising practice, including the commencement of section 93, will be considered in the context of the further implementation of the Charities Act.<\/p><p>  In addition to these statutory provisions, a growing number of charities have agreed to adhere to voluntary codes of practice on fundraising.  These were developed by the charities sector, with Government grant support, through umbrella charities organisation Irish Charities Tax Research Ltd.  This type of non-statutory approach can be an effective partner to statutory regulation as it allows best practice to respond to changing methods of fundraising and the changing environments in which charities work.<\/p><p>  One of the three 'core principles' upon which the codes of practice are based is that of respect by charities for the rights, dignity and privacy of their supporters, clients and beneficiaries.  These codes apply to all types of fundraising, including those that are not currently covered by the statutory permits system, such as non-cash collections and solicitations for support via direct debits.  My Department continues to give grant support to this project.<\/p><p>  Further information about the codes of practice and a list of all charities that have agreed to be bound by the Codes in their fundraising activities can be obtained from the website of Irish Charities Tax Research limited. at <i>www.ictr.ie<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500089#WRV01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":1050,"qnumday":440,"qnumall":"[30075\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500089#WRV01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide an update on the commencement of the provisions of the Charities Act and the progress of a regulatory system for the charities sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1051,"content":"<p>The Charities Act 2009 was designed to support and enhance public trust in charities by providing for the statutory registration and regulation of charities operating in Ireland by an independent Charities Regulatory Authority.  The decision was taken in 2011, because of the urgent need to make savings in Government expenditure, to defer full implementation of the Charities Act.

I was very pleased with the outcome of this consultation.

High data protection standards are essential in order to build the required levels of citizen trust and confidence in the digital economy and enable us to realise the full potential of this dynamic sector in terms of innovation, growth and new jobs. For this reason, the Union's data protection standards must keep pace with emerging technologies and new business models.<\/p><p>  From the outset, the Commission's proposals for reform have been accorded priority in discussions at both ministerial and expert levels. At the Informal Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council in January, I tabled a discussion paper on key aspects of the proposed General Data Protection Regulation which will replace the 1995 Data Protection Directive. The conclusions which I drew from that political debate helped to guide subsequent discussions at expert level. I subsequently submitted an interim Report to the JHA Council in March and a more detailed progress Report to the JHA Council earlier this month. Apart from these ministerial discussions, intensive discussions involving 26 days of meetings took place at expert level.<\/p><p>  The progress Report which I submitted to the JHA Council earlier this month identified the progress which we had made on key aspects of Chapters I to IV of the General Data Protection Regulation. These included a number of key provisions which define the material and territorial scope of the Regulation; its underlying principles; issues related to data subject consent; and the relationship between the right to protection of personal data and the rights to freedom of expression and public access to official documents. In addition, I invited Justice Ministers to broadly support enhanced transparency standards in order to facilitate more effective exercise of data subjects&rsquo; rights (Chapter III); introduction of the &lsquo;risk-based&rsquo; approach in order to calibrate the obligations of data controllers and data processors (Chapter IV); and the development and application of approved codes of conduct and certification mechanisms by controllers and processors as a means of demonstrating compliance with the Regulation. In addition, a draft revised text of Chapters I to IV which reflects the Presidency's view of the state of play of negotiations at this stage was submitted to the Council.  I have arranged to have these documents laid before the Houses for the information of Deputies and Senators.<\/p><p>  Overall, the Presidency's intensive efforts to make substantial headway on the data protection reform package at both political and expert levels has been recognised and warmly welcomed by Vice President Reding on behalf of the European Commission and by Justice Ministers. I believe that this progress provides a solid foundation for continued discussions on the remaining chapters of the Regulation, and the proposed Directive on data protection in the law enforcement area, and for their ultimate adoption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500090#WRW00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service Issues","counter":1098,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500090#WRW00925"},{"type":"question","counter":1099,"qnumday":457,"qnumall":"[30292\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500090#WRW01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to revise the monetary thresholds that apply to initiation of debt recovery proceedings in the District Court, Circuit Court and High Court; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1100,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Courts and Civil Law Miscellaneous Bill 2013, which is currently before the Seanad, proposes the introduction of new monetary jurisdiction limits for both the District and Circuit Courts, thus increasing the lower threshold for the High Court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500090#WRW01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":1101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500090#WRW01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1102,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[30309\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500090#WRW01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his Department or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have received any complaints or requests for an investigation as a result of a BBC Panorama programme in 2001 which revealed that a large amount of hacked material forming part of the Leveson Inquiry in Britain was filtered through this State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"998","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1103,"content":"<p>My Department has no record of correspondence of the kind referred to by the Deputy.

As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments to the Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature.  I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill, it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members including those being raised by the Deputy on this occasion.  This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee and work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis while also taking account of any intervening matters of relevance such as decisions by the Courts.  It remains my objective under this new approach, and subject to having to deal with the competing legislative demands of our EU\/IMF\/ECB Programme commitments, to be in a position to bring a revised Bill to Government for approval and publication before the end of the year.&quot;<\/i><\/blockquote>Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing in the area of international protection, I am proposing to introduce new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications in light of recent judgments in the Superior Courts.

For the most part, this represents a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for providing suitable accommodation for asylum seekers on a full board basis. RIA currently provides full board accommodation and ancillary services to 4,587 persons in 34 centres across the State. The issues raised in this question were examined in considerable detail in the 2010 Value for Money (VFM) Report which is available on the RIA website - www.ria.gov.ie. The Report found that there are no cheaper alternatives to the Direct Provision system. In fact, if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system. Note that if the State were to allow all asylum seekers avail of full social welfare supports, including rent supplement, the immediate impact would be for <i>all<\/i> asylum seekers, including those not currently in RIA accommodation, to avail of that financial support. As things stand, not all asylum seekers live in direct provision. Some live with friends or family or provide from their own resources.  I have said before that I accept that the length of time spent in direct provision and the complexity of the asylum process itself is an issue which needs to be addressed. The revised Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I intend to re-publish, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion.

RIA currently provides accommodation to 4,587 persons in 34 accommodation centres across the State.  Firstly, it is important to point out that services to asylum seekers in direct provision are main streamed.  As such, asylum seekers receive a health service, including mental health services, on the same basis as Irish citizens. This is, in many cases, superior to what it available in their country of origin.  Asylum seekers in direct provision first link in with health services when they are temporarily accommodated in a reception centre in Dublin after they first claim international protection.  In the reception centre, they are offered medical screening and are linked in with Community Welfare services.  Access is also provided to GP's, Public Health Nurses and psychological services.  After a period of approximately two weeks, those asylum seekers are scheduled for dispersal to accommodation centres throughout the country, subject to clearance by the HSE Health Centre in the reception centre.  If there are particular health concerns, a person may be retained for a period at the reception centre or may be dispersed to specified accommodation centres with access to particular health services.  Even after dispersal, further health needs may present.  Such cases are reviewed by RIA's internal administrative health unit in conjunction with the local health services to see if any administrative arrangements, transfers etc., can be put in place. RIA has access to an independent medical referee to assist in the assessment of particular health needs.<\/p><p>  On a more general level, it is very difficult to get any verifiable data in relation to the mental health of asylum seekers in Direct Provision.  Patently, an asylum seeker, having removed himself from the social and family supports he had in his country of origin to live in a communal setting of a direct provision centre with all of the uncertainty attaching to his longer term immigration status, is bound to be under stress to a greater extent than the 'settled' population.  The issue of whether poor mental health of some asylum seekers is a function of pre-migration stress, of the stress of the migration itself, of post migration issues, of living in Direct Provision, or a combination of these factors, is a complex matter and as such great caution should be exercised before drawing conclusions.  At all events, RIA does not have access, as a matter of course, to a person's confidential medical records.  Therefore, the collation of data regarding the number of persons with mental health problems in direct provision is a matter for the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500091#WRX01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Policy","counter":1158,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500091#WRX01250"},{"type":"question","counter":1159,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[30684\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500091#WRX01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views regarding the issue of asylum seekers and permission to work.","asker":"1011","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1160,"content":"<p>Section 9(4)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Refugee Act 1996 provides that applicants for international protection shall not seek or enter employment or carry on any business, trade or profession during the period before the final determination of their application.

In 2013 (to end May) the median processing time from date of initial application at ORAC through the appeal stage at RAT, to a final Ministerial decision, was 8.3 months.  I should point out that some cases can take significantly longer to complete due to, for example, delays arising from medical issues, or because of judicial review proceedings.  All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.  A person who is refused a declaration of refugee status is, in addition to other options, notified of their entitlement under the leave to remain process, to apply for subsidiary protection in the State.  This is separate to the asylum or refugee status determination process.  The leave to remain process involves consideration of applications for subsidiary protection and other reasons which a failed asylum seeker may present for remaining in the State.  The processing of such cases is complex and extremely resource intensive.  The investigation of a subsidiary protection application requires a fresh examination of the entire asylum file, the documentation and country of origin information submitted in support of the application as well as an examination of objective, reputable, up to date country of origin information before a conclusion can be arrived at as to whether the applicant is likely to be exposed to 'serious harm' if returned to his\/her country of origin.  Where such an application is refused consideration must then be given to the case in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the 1999 Act, at which point the Minister must make a decision as to whether or not to make a Deportation Order in respect of that person.  All of this must be done in strict compliance with the Constitution, together with relevant international treaties, such as the European Convention on Human Rights.  It will be seen that these are not quick or easy decisions to make and, given the life changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.  While the current statutory framework for the processing of protection applications is fair, giving applicants, as it does, every opportunity to present their case, it is nonetheless inefficient and needs reform.  The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which the I intend to re-publish, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more 'straight forward' and timely fashion.  In this regard, the Bill makes provision for the introduction of a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State.<\/p><p>  Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing in the area of international protection, I am proposing to introduce new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications in light of recent judgments in the Superior Courts.

However, while such registers have been established in many countries, the discussions with the Law Society revealed a number of difficulties with the viability of any such scheme in this jurisdiction. For example, the registration of a will would not guarantee its validity, i.e. compliance with the statutory requirements concerning signature and witnessing of a will. It would not prove that the will had been property executed or that the testator had not been subject to undue influence. Moreover, there could be no guarantee that the registered will was indeed the last will of the testator. The most that registration could confirm would be that a particular will had been registered on a particular day; it could not confer any priority over later unregistered wills, nor would it provide any guarantee that a registered will had not been revoked or replaced by a later will. For these reasons, Ireland has not signed or ratified the Convention on the Establishment of a Scheme of Registration of Wills and there are no current plans to do so.<\/p><p>  It is the case that many people die in this country without making a will, i.e. they have died intestate. The Annual Report of the Courts Service for 2011 indicates that of the 16,350 applications made to the Probate Office during that year, 12,520 (76.5%) arose from cases where a will had been made and 3,820 (23.5%) were in respect of intestacy cases. In some such cases, it may be assumed that death was unexpected, especially in cases of accidents. In other cases, a conscious decision may have been taken not to make a will, possibly because of reluctance to choose between potential beneficiaries or because the individual concerned was satisfied that the estate would be divided under Part 6 of the Succession Act 1965 which sets out clear and unambiguous rules for distribution on intestacy. An EU Regulation  (650\/2012) on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and acceptance and enforcement of authentic instruments in matters of successions and on the creation of a European Certificate of Succession was agreed in July 2012. In accordance with the Protocol No 21 on the position of Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Ireland did not take part in the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 650\/2012. Ireland took the decision not to opt-in to this Regulation on the grounds that, despite intensive negotiations, the final text of the Regulation would have interfered to an unacceptable extent with the manner in which estates are administered in this jurisdiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500091#WRX02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting Applications","counter":1171,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500091#WRX02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1172,"qnumday":482,"qnumall":"[30712\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500091#WRX02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if an application for Garda vetting which was submitted in February in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 9 will be finalised as soon as possible in view of the fact that the applicant cannot take up a community employment position until the process is completed.","asker":"1178","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1173,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a vetting application on behalf of the individual referred to was received by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU).

The area is subject to twenty-four hour foot and mobile patrols including uniform high visibility personnel, plain clothes personnel, the Crime Task Force and the Drug and Crime Prevention Units. Local Garda Management closely monitor such patrols, and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to local communities. A number of policing initiatives have been put in place by local Garda management to prevent and disrupt anti-social behaviour, including the sale, distribution and use of drugs in the locality. These initiatives have been acknowledged by the local business community as resulting in a reduction of such behaviour. In particular, a High Visibility Policing Plan is in place within the Dublin city area.

Operation Redline targets criminals using the Luas Red Line and supports the Veolia Staff working on the Red Line.

The role included notifying childminders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the voluntary notification system which was being developed by the CCCs.<\/p><p>  While Childminding Advisory Officers were established in most county areas, this was not always the case and they were not always located with the local CCC.

In recent years, the HSE made a decision to gradually reduce the level of funding and support for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts.

A broad range of issues relating to regulations, standards, quality assurance, and inspection are currently being considered by the Expert Advisory Group which is advising my Department on the Strategy. As Minister I am committed to ensuring high standards in early years service provision, both in terms of care and curriculum. The role of quality provision is critical in contributing to childhood development and I am determined that this key objective will be reflected fully in the Early Years Strategy.

In childcare services that qualify for the standard capitation, the pre-school leader must currently hold the full FETAC 5 qualification on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or equivalent.<\/p><p>  The higher capitation fee is payable to pre-school service providers where all pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school service hold a bachelor degree in childhood\/early education (minimum of Level 7 on the NFQ or equivalent) and have 3 years experience working in the sector, and where all pre-school assistants in the service hold a relevant major award in childcare\/early education at level 5 on the NFQ or its equivalent.<\/p><p>  I have indicated my intention to increase the qualification requirements for all staff working in pre-school services.  The minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year will be increased to Level 6.  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  This requirement will be effective from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services.  My Department is currently examining measures to support training for childcare staff in line with the increased qualification requirements.<\/p><p>  Pobal, which administers the childcare support programmes on behalf of my Department, compiles an Annual Survey of the Early Years Sector.  According to its 2011 Annual Survey, there are in the region of 4,300 childcare services participating in the ECCE programme and approximately 3,133 of these services responded to the question relating to the number of staff employed.  The results, which did not distinguish between those working with children enrolled for the ECCE programme and other children in the childcare service, show that some 17,123 staff in the 3,133 services that responded were working directly with children.  <\/p><p>  Figures compiled earlier this year indicated that approximately 20% of the 4,300 services participating in the ECCE programme are in receipt of the higher capitation.  All participating services must provide information relating to the qualifications of staff currently delivering the pre-school year, and we are examining the possibility of extending this to a national registration system.  Given the vast range of childcare qualifications and awarding authorities, including international awarding bodies, this will not be an easy task.  A national qualification and registration system for all early years professionals would be useful, and my Department will be liaising with the Early Years Education Unit, which is co-located within my Department, to determine the optimum means of building and maintaining such a register.<\/p><p>  The ECCE programme is designed as an education programme for children.  Services are required to implement Siolta, the Early Education Framework developed by the Department of Education and Skills.

Under the programme, the pre-school leader delivering the programme must hold a qualification in childcare\/early education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ), or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare\/early education field.  A higher capitation rate is payable to services where all of the pre-school leaders hold a bachelor degree in childhood\/early education (minimum of Level 7 on the NFQ) and have three years experience working in the sector, and where all of the pre-school assistants hold a relevant major award in childcare\/early education at Level 5 on the NFQ.<\/p><p>  I have indicated my intention to increase the qualification requirements for all staff working in pre-school services.  The minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year will be increased to Level 6.  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  This requirement will be effective from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services. <\/p><p>  Under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006, the inspection of pre-schools is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE).<\/p><p>  It is important to realise that inspections alone are not the answer to improving quality. What is required is a multifaceted approach, and since this Government came to office we have been working to ensure issues relating to child protection and welfare are put front and centre. The establishment of a Department of Children and Youth Affairs was recognition of the huge body of work which needs to be done in this area.<\/p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, driving the early childhood care and education quality agenda is one of my key objectives.  I believe we can achieve this objective by taking a number of steps in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, including the adaptation of the existing pre-school inspection system to provide a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for pre-schools, moving to a greater focus on outcomes for children.<\/p><p>  In support of this, a Joint Pilot Inspection of Early Years Services was carried out by Inspectors from the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills between September 2011 and May 2012.  This pilot will inform the proactive approach being taken.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to improve the quality of the free Pre-School Year and, by extension, the quality of all early childhood care and education, through the implementation of standards and by reviewing training options for the workforce. <\/p><p>  This commitment has always been a key priority for me.  This is why my Department and I have been progressing work on Ireland's first-ever Early Years Strategy and this why we have been working on a comprehensive<b><\/b>Pre-School Quality Agenda. <\/p><p>  We have identified a number of key areas of action which I believe need to be considered and addressed as a matter of urgency.  These include:<\/p><p>- Introducing a registration system for all pre-school services <\/p><p>- Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust<\/p><p>- Publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible<\/p><p>- Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance<\/p><p>- Increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance. <\/p><p><b>Registration of all childcare providers<\/b><\/p><p>  Work is already underway in the Child and Family Services area of the Health Service Executive (HSE) to introduce a registration system for pre-school services.  I understand this system will be in place for new services from the end of this year and will be phased in for existing services thereafter.  This is an important development because it will move services from the current position, where they are required to notify the Pre-School Inspectorate of their intention to open, to a requirement to be inspected and found satisfactory, before being permitted to open.  All pre-school services are currently required to pay an annual fee to the HSE of between &euro;40 and &euro;80.  I am looking at increasing this fee.  The additional funds raised will assist in improving inspection and supports for quality improvement. <\/p><p><b>Publication of Inspection Reports<\/b><\/p><p>Parents will rightly demand and expect the highest standards and this will be a key factor in driving change in the sector.  Publishing inspection reports is an essential step in ensuring high standards and accountability. All new inspection reports will be made available on-line from the HSE as a matter of urgency.  All current inspection reports will be made available on-line in 2014.<\/p><p><b>Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working on developing a more robust, consistent and regular inspection system  There has been a significant programme of work underway in the HSE over the past year to develop a single, consistent national inspection service (as opposed to 37 different local systems).  <\/p><p>  We propose moving to a position where there is consistent and assured national target rate for the frequency of inspection of pre-school services, while ensuring capacity for prioritisation based on risk assessment. The HSE is currently reviewing the regional spread of inspectors with a view to identifying whether either additional resources or redeployment of existing inspectors is required to achieve this. <\/p><p>  Building on this work, officials of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills have been examining options to incrementally develop a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for pre-schools; moving away from a narrow focus on compliance, and leading to a greater focus on children's outcomes, including educational development and child wellbeing.  This work is being informed by the findings of the recent Joint Pilot Inspection carried out in a small number of settings by Inspectors from the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p><b>Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working to ensure consistent action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance. There must be a follow-through on inspections.  Clearly, services which are found to be in serious breach of the Regulations will face closure and prosecution.

Under the Scheme, nursing home residents contribute towards the cost of their nursing home care based on their means, and the HSE pays the balance. The budget for the Scheme in 2013 is &euro;974m.<\/p><p>  Currently, an individual's contribution towards the cost of their care is calculated based on 80% of their income and 5% of their assets per annum. If the person is a member of a couple, the assessment is based on half of the couple's combined income and assets. <\/p><p>  The average weekly contribution under the Scheme is currently about &euro;280.<\/p><p>  It was announced in Budget 2013 that the asset contribution would be increased from 5% to 7.5% per annum.  The legislation underpinning the Scheme must be amended before this change can take effect and this is being progressed in the Health (Amendment) Bill 2013. The increased asset contribution will only apply to new entrants to the Scheme after the enactment of the Bill. In the case of the principal residence, there will be a cap of 22.5% (i.e. three years). <\/p><p>  The Scheme contains several important safeguards which ensure that both the person in the nursing home and their spouse\/partner, if applicable, are adequately provided for:<\/p><p>1. Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.<\/p><p>2. The first &euro;36,000 for a person's assets, or &euro;72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment.  <\/p><p>3. The principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care. This three year cap can also apply to family farms\/businesses in certain circumstances.<\/p><p>4. Where an individual's assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is the optional Nursing Home Loan element of the scheme.<\/p><p>5. Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.<\/p><p>6. If there is a spouse\/partner remaining at home, s\/he will retain 50% of the couples income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.<\/p><p>7. Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment. These allowable deductions include health expenses. <\/p><p>8. There is a financial review mechanism which takes account of the fluctuating value of assets and the fact that cash assets will naturally deplete over time as payments are made to the nursing home etc. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500094#WRAA03200","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff Issues","counter":1354,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500094#WRAA03250"},{"type":"question","counter":1355,"qnumday":545,"qnumall":"[30015\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500094#WRAA03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will confirm if reports are correct that South Doc is regularly called into Bantry Hospital, County Cork, to attend patients in the absences of duty doctors; and if so, whether this a new policy on the part of the Health Service Executive; the amount it has cost since January 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1356,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service issue, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500094#WRAA03400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Patient Statistics","counter":1357,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500094#WRAA03450"},{"type":"question","counter":1358,"qnumday":546,"qnumall":"[30016\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500094#WRAA03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there is a record of the number of patients with minor injuries that have been redirected from Bantry Hospital, County Cork, to Cork city hospitals without treatment from January 2013 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1359,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service issue, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500094#WRAA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Issues","counter":1360,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500094#WRAA03650"},{"type":"question","counter":1361,"qnumday":547,"qnumall":"[30052\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500094#WRAA03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will arrange for the change of name in respect of a medical card in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1362,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in recent years in services for children with disabilities.

The therapist, in conjunction with the parent(s) or carer, will determine the severity of the individual&rsquo;s difficulties and prioritise for therapy accordingly.  The level of intervention is in line with clinic policy, age and severity of the diagnosis.  The waiting period for intervention is dependent on the nature and severity of the disorder following assessment. <\/p><p>  The HSE aims to ensure that the resources available are used to best effect, in order to provide assessment and ongoing therapy to children and adults in line with their prioritised needs.  Along with the significant investment in area of speech and language therapists employed in recent years, a range of new approaches have been developed and used in many Speech and Language Therapy services across the country.  These include providing structures, training and support to parents \/carers so that they can work to help improve the individual&rsquo;s speech and language. In addition, therapy is delivered in group settings where appropriate. <\/p><p>  The HSE has stated that it is committed to working in partnership with other service providers to achieve maximum benefits for children and adults with speech and language therapy requirements, and aims to ensure that, the speech and language therapy resources available are used in the most effective manner possible.<\/p><p>  The particular issue raised by the Deputy relates to an individual case and, as such, is a service matter for the Health Service Executive.

Compared to population growth of 8.2% in the State as a whole, this is one of the age groups which experienced greatest growth over the period.  The funding available for services for older people is not increasing at the same rate as the population.  The State has limited resources.  However, the demands being made of these resources continue to increase.  The increase to the asset contribution is necessary to support the sustainability of the Scheme.  Notwithstanding that, it must be stressed that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme remains an extremely generous one.  Even after these changes take effect, the State will continue to meet by far the greater part of the cost of care in the majority of cases, with nursing home residents making a much smaller contribution.<\/p><p>  The Scheme contains several important safeguards which ensure that both the person in the nursing home and their spouse\/partner, if applicable, are adequately provided for:<\/p><p>- Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.<\/p><p>- The first &euro;36,000 for a person's assets, or &euro;72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment.  <\/p><p>- The principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care. <\/p><p>- Where an individual's assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate.  This is the optional Nursing Home Loan element of the scheme.<\/p><p>- Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.<\/p><p>- If there is a spouse\/partner remaining at home, s\/he will retain 50% of the couples income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.<\/p><p>- Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment.  These allowable deductions include health expenses. <\/p><p>- There is a financial review mechanism which takes account of the fluctuating value of assets and the fact that cash assets will naturally deplete over time as payments are made to the nursing home etc. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500096#WRCC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Suicide Prevention","counter":1464,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500096#WRCC02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1465,"qnumday":580,"qnumall":"[30295\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062500096#WRCC02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"If he will present a detailed report in tabular form a breakdown of the extra &euro;35 million spending on suicide prevention that he has committed to this year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1466,"content":"<p>&euro;35 million additional funding was provided in Budget 2013 for the continued development of our mental health services.

I want insurers to address the base cost of each element of claims which they pay.  This is the real issue as costs are becoming unsustainable at present.  Last year, I established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance to generate ideas to address health insurance costs, while always respecting the requirements of competition law.  I have made it clear to the health insurers that I believe significant savings can be made, ultimately reducing the impact of rising health costs on health insurance premiums for the consumer.  Last week I announced the appointment of an independent Chairperson to work with my Department and the insurers under the auspices of the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance.  The Chairperson will oversee a process of review to give effect to real cost reductions in the private health insurance market. Specific areas that I have asked insurers to address include:<\/p><p>- Audit - of the volume of procedures;<\/p><p>- Clinical audit - to determine the appropriateness of procedures being claimed for;<\/p><p>- Procedure based payments - in particular with a view to their extension to the public health sector; and<\/p><p>- Benchmarking - to determine the underlying basis for the cost of specific procedures, with a view to driving costs downwards. <\/p><p>  I am strongly of the view that all procedures should be provided at an appropriate setting that is safe and provides value for money for consumers.<\/p><p>  Given VHI's very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs.  At my instruction, the VHI recently compiled a detailed cost containment plan, which sets out savings targets for 2013 and for the 2014-2016 period, so as to minimise the need for any future premium increases.  The savings targets over this period are to be achieved through a combination of initiatives including rate reductions with private hospitals and consultants, utilisation management, expansion of clinical audit, reductions in high cost drugs and prosthesis, provider reviews and the continued transition of procedures to lower cost, medically appropriate settings. <\/p><p>  The Deputy has also raised concerns about the need to ensure that cherry-picking by health insurers is discouraged.  In this regard, the<b><\/b>Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2012 provides for the introduction of a permanent Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) in the private health insurance market, with effect from 1 January, 2013.  This new scheme puts in place, for the first time in this country, a permanent and robust system of Risk Equalisation.  The scheme is budget neutral and has no overall impact on the costs in the market.  It supports competition by encouraging insurers to move their  focus away from avoiding older, less healthy customers and towards innovation, achieving greater efficiencies and improved customer service.  This is the kind of competition which is best for consumers and is intended to support the Government's efforts to maintain community rating in the Irish health insurance market.<\/p><p>  The revised rates for 2013 will, from 31 March onwards, increase the support levels in respect of older and less healthy customers, so that health insurance will be made more affordable for them.  Without this support, health insurers have a strong financial incentive to 'segment' the market by offering policies targeted at younger, healthier people.
