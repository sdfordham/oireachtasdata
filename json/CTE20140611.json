We are delighted that he was able to accept our invitation to come to Dublin.  I also welcome Mr. Stephane Lebrun, head of unit at the Directorate General of Enterprise and Industry, and Ms Barbara Nolan, head of representation of the European Commission in Ireland, whom we have met before on several occasions.<\/p><p>  When we visited Brussels in January, we discussed a range of EU policy issues within the joint committee's remit, including access to finance for Irish small and medium enterprises, Horizon 2020, the EU semester process and relations between national parliaments and the EU institutions.  Mr. Calleja Crespo's visit here is a result of our meeting with him in Brussels and is a further step in strengthening relations between our Parliament and the EU institutions.<\/p> <p>As mentioned, eight members of this joint committee travelled on that occasion and found it very worthwhile and informative.  We are in a better position to engage with EU institutions as a result and we will inform our colleagues on other committees that they should do likewise.  I know that Mr. Calleja Crespo is encouraging such initiatives.<br\/>As part of its work programme for 2014, the joint committee has, in recent months, examined the issue of access to finance for small and medium enterprises, SMEs, in light of growing concerns in the sector that such access is extremely difficult to achieve.  We have engaged with a wide range of stakeholders to elicit their views and have thus gained valuable insights into the current situation relating to access to finance for SMEs.  We have examined initiatives to assist SMEs that have emerged since the banking crisis.  Difficulty accessing finance has had an impact on entrepreneurship and growth.  The joint committee has also heard presentations on alternative sources of funding, such as crowd funding.  We intend to compile a report with recommendations on policy initiatives to support SMEs in Ireland and throughout Europe.  We hope this report will be completed in July.<br\/>This meeting today will provide an opportunity to engage further with these issues.  In particular, we will discuss what Europe is doing to support SMEs as it is widely acknowledged they contribute substantially to employment growth and economic prosperity.  SMEs have a vital role to play in the economic recovery of Ireland and Europe.  Access to finance is crucial for the survival of SMEs and therefore we must ensure everything possible is done to create and maintain an environment supportive of this vital sector of our economy.<br\/>I wish to advise that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br\/>A short meeting between Mr. Calleja Crespo and the Taoiseach is scheduled for 2 p.m. so this meeting will end at 1.55 p.m.  There will be time to engage over lunch if the Taoiseach releases Mr. Calleja Crespo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061100002#A00200","speaker":"1078","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402480800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I am pleased to participate in this session of the joint committee.  When I received the invitation to attend the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation of the Irish Parliament I had no hesitation in accepting.  The meeting in Brussels in January was so successful that I promised to come over, if invited, to continue our discussions.  In the European Commission growing importance is attached to relations with national parliaments.  It is very important that European policies are closely linked to the activities of national parliaments.  It is very important to explain what the Commission does but also to learn the main issues and challenges facing national parliaments.<\/p><p>  On Monday I appeared before the committee on jobs of the Spanish Parliament and we discussed the key challenges faced by young people there including job opportunities, policies for SMEs and entrepreneurship.  <\/p><p>  This meeting is taking place at a very particular moment.  Some days ago the Commission issued its country-specific recommendations relating to countries in the framework.  A specific process was provided by the annual growth survey in November.  In the country specific recommendations process we engage in dialogue with member states and try to point out issues that require more work to each country.  We aim identify the most pressing problems that hamper growth and work together to address them.  This process will reach an important point in June when the European Council will meet and formally adopt the Commission's proposals.<\/p><p>  There were seven country specific recommendations relating to Ireland and they addressed topics such as public finances, health care, the labour market, education and, as rightly mentioned by the Chairman, access to finance for SMEs.  I will come to the topic of SMEs but I do not want to take long so I will highlight the priorities of the Department of Enterprise and Industry at the European Commission.  There are two major areas of work at that Department, enterprise and industry.  On the one hand there are enterprise, SMEs and entrepreneurship and on the other hand there are industrial strategy and industrial competitiveness in all sectors of the economy, from the automotive to the aeronautical to the chemical to the mechanical and so on.<\/p><p>  To outline the main priorities of our policy I will first stress the fact that Europe in recent years has seen the most serious economic crisis since the Second World War.  Millions of jobs have been lost and there has been a major decline in industry.  Thousands of SMEs have closed and we are emphasising the need for a renewed industrial strategy.  Industrial competitiveness must be prioritised in the coming years and we must mainstream competitiveness in all areas of the economy.  We must make our productive sector the engine of the recovery.  For many years it was thought the best industrial strategy was that which did not exist.  We have seen that the countries that best survived the crisis are those that did not dismantle their productive sectors.  Every country with an industry and manufacturing sector is doing better than those that do not because each job in manufacturing means two or three more jobs in the service sector.  This is why we emphasise the importance of industry and manufacturing.  It is important that the EU has a strong industrial base as it is a region that can attract investment and have a dynamic, flourishing economy.<\/p><p>  However we look at all this we reach the same conclusion: we must work for our SMEs.  SMEs are the backbone of the economy and the main source of job creation.  In Europe there are 23 million SMEs and they have created 80% of new jobs in the past five years.  In the private sector two out of three jobs are in SMEs.  If we ignore the importance of SMEs we will not address the needs of our citizens and the real economy.  More than this, SMEs are the key factor in social and economic cohesion across Europe.  My Department and the Commission seek to place SMEs at the centre of strategy because growth depends on competitiveness and SME policy being in the mainstream.<\/p><p>  I will now mention some of the main areas where our actions will focus.  I meet representatives of SMEs every day throughout the European Union and they say the most pressing issue they face is accessing finance.  The credit crunch and economic crisis have seen many problems emerge for SMEs.  The European Central Bank regularly conducts a survey on access to finance and, according to the latest statistics they have gathered, 23% of Irish SMEs find access to finance to be their biggest concern.<\/p> <p>That compares to an average of 14% in the euro area.  In Ireland it is a very important issue.  Some 50% of the surveyed Irish SMEs did not manage to get the full amount they had planned for during the previous six months and 23% of their loan applications were rejected.  Some 19% of companies received less than they had applied for.  An important first challenge is to make sure that the credit goes back into the real economy.  In this respect, we believe that the situation will improve.  The measures adopted by the European Central Bank last week and the announcement by Mr. Draghi of &euro;500 billion being put into the real economy and the reduction of the rates will have a positive impact.  With the growth in our economies, the conditions in terms of gaining access to finance will improve.  However, we need to make a big effort in the coming years to mobilise all the instruments, banking and non-banking instruments.  This is precisely one of the recommendations that the European Commission is putting forward.  In the case of Ireland we believe it is very important to develop further policy initiatives to address the availability of bank and non-bank financing and, in particular, to improve SMEs' access to bank credit and non-bank finance.  I will be more precise about this.  There are two important issues that must be addressed.  The first is the disseminating of information.  SMEs are small micro companies and it is difficult for them to have access to the various financing sources.  We need to make a special effort to disseminate information on the possibilities for financing and we need to reach the SMEs.  We introduced a pilot programme with the Spanish Banking Association in Spain last Friday in order that the SMEs, even if they are in located in the most rural areas, will always have access to a bank and they will be linked into the information on all the EU financing programmes -  this information will be channelled to them.  <\/p><p> A second issue that is important in Europe is that we need to do more in respect of non-banking activities.  I am speaking about venture capital, business angels and crowdfunding.  We must mobilise all the instruments.  We have new programmes which we will start this year, 2014, such as the 2020 programme, which will be targeted at SMEs.  The COMSE programme is a programme that for the first time in the history of the EU is exclusively reserved for SMEs.  Two thirds of the funds will be for loan guarantees and venture capital.  This is a programme which offers many possibilities.  Horizon 2020 is a programme for innovative SMEs.  We will also have an important SME instrument.  We will have new possibilities and it is important that we disseminate the information on  these new programmes to the various SMEs.  I call for members' co-operation in raising awareness of these programmes.  I discussed with the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, who is the SME envoy, the possibility of providing more information and assistance to the SMEs.  It is important to link with the European Investment Fund which will manage these programmes in order that we will be able to make an important effort in the coming months.  <\/p><p> With regard to regional funding, there will be &euro;325 billion available in regional funds for the whole of European in the next seven years.  We have built a good deal of infrastructure in Europe.  The priority must be SMEs, innovation and new technologies.  There are possibilities that can be mobilised.  <\/p><p> The late payments directive is an important instrument.  One out of three companies which has failed in Europe has done so due to problems related to late payments.  We need to have more action on this both from the public authorities and from the business community.  I can provide further information in writing on this important challenge, or the members can put questions to me on it.<\/p><p> The second important challenge is internationalisation.  We need to do more on this and we would like to work closely with Ireland in this respect.  In Europe only one out of four companies is using the Internal Market.  This means that three out of four are remaining in the country and only one out of eight is going outside the EU in terms of their operations.  The growth with the emerging economies is outside the EU.  Internationalisation is a must.  We will push very hard in the direction of improving this situation in the coming years.  If a company is not global it puts at risk its survival.  The world is too big for companies to remain in local markets.  There are important opportunities coming up and I will mention some of them.  First, there is the free trade agreements, which the European Union is negotiating throughout the world and in particular the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, agreement.  It will be a great opportunity.  It can inject into the economy &euro;60 billion, 1% GDP additional growth.  Ireland is very well placed and Irish SMEs can benefit from this agreement.  It is a very complex negotiation, covering tariffs, public procurements and regulatory co-operation but it is an important area and we have to negotiate also with Japan, Canada and India.  We need to offer our companies more opportunities but we also need to support SMEs and provide them with more information.  The Enterprise Europe Network brings together more than 600 business organisations in more than 50 countries.  In Ireland there is currently one enterprise network consortium with partners in the chambers of commerce of Dublin, Galway, Sligo, Cork and Enterprise Ireland in Dublin.  This is a consortium that is functioning well.  Over the coming years we will be financing it and the idea is to provide information, disseminate opportunities, facilitate contacts and provide opportunities for joint ventures.  This will be an very important area.  I am referring to internationalisation within and outside the EU.  <\/p><p> However there is a third very important priority.  It is not only important to gain access to finance and markets but probably one of the biggest challenges facing Europe is promoting entrepreneurship.  Only one out three Europeans sees becoming an entrepreneur as a career prospect.  This means two out of three would never do it.  In China it is exactly the opposite.  Two out of three see it as the most important prospect.  More than half of Americans view creating their own business as a very good career prospect.  Our Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan is an effort to work with the member states and the business community to change the situation.  There are many reasons.  Our society is ageing and it is risk averse.  We risk losing an entire generation of entrepreneurs if nothing is done.  We need to work first at the education level, starting in the primary schools because this is what delivers the best results.  We need to eliminate problems in society.  I am speaking about people getting a second chance when an honest entrepreneurship fails and the finger is pointed at him or her.  We must facilitate people to get quickly out of bankruptcy procedures.  Another issue is the transfer of business.  Every year Europe is losing 150,000 businesses and 450,000 jobs because we do not have a good system of transfer of business - of succession.  Companies are dismantled.  It is much easier for a person to continue an existing company than it is to start up a company from scratch.  We will address these issues in this initiative as well as promoting targeted action in favour of certain groups of the population in terms of an Erasmus of young entrepreneurs.  A young entrepreneur will be able to spend up to six months in another country.  We expect to reach the 10,000 exchanges. <\/p> <p>We would like to have more Irish entrepreneurs participating.  Entrepreneurship among women is also a vital area.  In Europe only 34% of business people are women and there is great potential for growth.  Mentoring and coaching programmes are important.  Senior entrepreneurs are needed to advise young entrepreneurs.  All of that will be part of the entrepreneurship action plan 2020.  We are trying to work very closely with the 28 member states.  We have the network of SME envoys, which I chair.  Ireland is represented by the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, with whom we work very well.  We have the business associations working together in implementing the small business legislation.<\/p><p> There are many initiatives.  I do not wish to forget about cutting red tape, administrative simplification, reducing bureaucracy, simplifying the creation of companies, and licensing.  There are initiatives in this country in that regard.  The Parliament should please do all it can to help.  When I speak to SMEs they tell me they spend more time filling in forms than doing their work which is selling products and performing services.  It is very important we mobilise our efforts in the coming years.  There is nothing more important than confronting this challenge.  Europe will not ensure a sustainable recovery and we will not sustain growth and jobs if we do not put our companies, SMEs, and entrepreneurs at the centre of our priorities.<\/p><p> I have exceeded my time.  I get carried away when I discuss these issues.  Members will have many questions.  I wish to conclude with a final message.  It is one of confidence.  I am very confident that if we work together with the member states, the European institutions, the national parliaments and the business community, we can improve the situation dramatically.  We have identified a strategy and there is no disagreement on the problems.  I have never heard someone say in any discussion that what we outline is wrong, for example, that access to finance is not important.  We know the issues and what we must do in the future is implement a strong strategy to tackle the problems.  We must use the new funds we have and seize the opportunity of the recovering economy to change the situation and to provide a favourable environment for entrepreneurs and SMEs so that we can succeed in creating jobs and deliver more prosperity for citizens.  That is the challenge.  I welcome co-operation from all member states, including the Irish Parliament, to work together to succeed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061100003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel Calleja Crespo","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402482000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the director general for his comments.

The committee has focused very much on SMEs and support for them.  During the visit to Brussels the meeting with the Director General was one of the best exchanges we had.<\/p><p>  One of the big issues facing the SME sector in this State is the level of indebtedness.  It has been acknowledged as a serious problem when the matter was discussed by economists and the SME sector.  What is Mr. Calleja Crespo&rsquo;s understanding of the problem in this country compared with other member states?<\/p><p>  We invited organisations representing SMEs generally and the banks to discuss barriers to credit and how to access credit.  There is a clear difference between what the banks told us and what the organisations that represent small businesses told us, namely, the latter find it difficult to get access to credit.  A lack of appetite for risk is evident within the banking sector.  What is Mr. Calleja Crespo&rsquo;s view?  How prevalent is that situation across Europe?  Does he have any comparisons between banks&rsquo; lending to SMEs in this country compared with other European countries?<\/p><p>  Issues arise in terms of formal applications being made where there is a discrepancy between the number of loans approved and the number drawn down.  How big an issue is that across the EU?  We have put a considerable effort into upskilling and retraining employees, which is hugely important, but there is also a need to train and upskill employers, especially in the SME sector.  What policies are in place and are envisaged at European Union level to support that aim as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061100005#D00300","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1402482000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>It is a pleasure to meet Mr. Calleja Crespo.  I was chairman and vice chairman of EuroCommerce for a number of years.  One of the challenges to SMEs is the one he touched on, namely, bureaucracy and red tape.  What can we do to reduce it?  I understand in France and perhaps in other countries that such red tape does not really come into being until one has 50 employees.  We in this country have the same rules for someone with 2,000 or 10,000 employees as we have for somebody with four employees.  Is there any example that Europe can set to reduce the red tape and bureaucracy for small companies, in particular start-up companies?  That would be a huge benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061100005#D00400","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402482000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the members for raising two such important issues, access to finance and cutting red tape.  It is true that the level of debt is an important issue in terms of access to finance.  Because of the financial crisis and the banking crisis we have seen many companies heavily in debt.  Credit was easily obtained and in many countries the private sector has a huge amount of debt which has put their situation at risk.  Many companies have failed.  Another problem we have seen is that those who were unable to repay and who entered into bankruptcy proceedings are still involved in such proceedings.  One of the big problems we have is the lack of effective bankruptcy procedures throughout the European Union which means that an honest entrepreneur who fails cannot get through the bankruptcy procedure quickly.<\/p><p>  In addition, following the banking collapse, banks have become very careful and risk averse.  To make things worse &ndash; this is a special feature of Europe &ndash; in Europe we have an excess of dependence on the banking sector.  In other countries when a company wants to finance a project it goes to a bank, a fund or seeks venture capital but in Europe we have less venture capital than ten years ago.  When the banking sector collapses then the economy collapses.  That is why we strongly recommend the development of the non-banking sector because it allows one to have a more diversified system.  That is the reason venture capital is so important and it is why in the European programmes we will have loan guarantees but we will also have the equity facility to facilitate venture capital, business angels, crowd funding and various other instruments.<\/p><p>  As to what we can do about it, the macroeconomic situation will improve things.  Everything has to be seen in an overall framework.  The efforts which Ireland and all the other countries are making in pursuing the control of public finance will also have a positive impact on the economy.  There have been reforms in the labour market and in the financial systems and they are having an impact on recovering from the economic situation, but that is not enough.  We need to work together with the banking sector and with the business community to develop further possibilities.  That is where action in terms of information comes into place.<\/p> <p>We need to understand the needs of the small and medium enterprises and the position of the banks to see if we can together identify what would be the best practices and the best way forward.<\/p><p> The European programmes will play an important role.  That is the reason I discussed with the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, this morning action in terms of information specifically directed to Ireland, if there is such a need.  I was looking at the figures and Ireland did not use many of the previous programmes.  There were only two operations since 2007.  The first step was the micro credit guarantee and the Fountain Healthcare Partners fund.  Those were the only two operations.  The new programmes will come into place in the second half of the year, 2014 to 2020.  They are not preassigned.  If we have projects and there are opportunities, they can benefit.  This is an important effort.<\/p><p> The issue of training was highlighted.  Training for employees is very important, as is training for employers.  In terms of the policies at European Union level, I point out that the issue of training is critical.  It is also a challenge for an SME but skilled people are very important in terms of developing our business and our productive sector.  We are facing a paradox in Europe.  We have an unemployment rate for young people below the age of 25 of over 50% in many countries, including the southern countries, and a deficit of 1 million skilled workers in ICT.  There is something wrong in our economy.<\/p><p> An effort has to be made to match the needs of business with the education sector, and some countries are doing that very well through the dual system.  We need to anticipate business needs and get businesses closer to the education sector so that what the education sector delivers has employability opportunities in terms of the economy.  We are doing that through best practices among member states but we have the European Alliance for Apprenticeships and the ERASMUS+ programme.  There are many initiatives, and we are urging member states to improve that connection.<\/p><p> In terms of employers, the biggest challenge we have now is the digital divide.  E-skills and the digital economy can multiply the chances of business for SMEs.  We are putting in place programmes to facilitate access by SMEs to the e-economy.  I met entrepreneurs recently in Barcelona who are starting up a company.  One of them told me they had discovered, thanks to the digital economy, that they can multiply their business.  They inherited a company that was selling paints to Morocco but they are now selling furniture, paints, shoes and various goods not only to Morocco but to Turkey and Italy.  They were doing that because they were using digital technology.  The digital economy is a multiplicator of the activities of the business model and the biggest challenge in the coming years is to link e-skills to the manufacturing sector, industry and services, and to multiply the possibilities.  That is an area where we will have the possibility to finance programmes with the member states.<\/p><p> What can we do about bureaucracy?  That is a very good question.  Whatever we are doing, it is not enough.  We need to examine this problem across the entire cycle.  We are proposing that before a new rule is adopted each country, and the EU is already doing it ,should conduct the SME test.  In terms of the impact of this rule on SMEs, if the impact is negative because it will increase the burden, the rule should be reconsidered.  If for some overriding reasons it cannot be reconsidered, there should be a simplified process for SMEs.<\/p><p> We have proposed exempting micro-companies from legislation unless it is indispensable to cover them, in which case there should be a simplified regime.  There have been diverging reactions to this proposal, including from the SMEs because some have told us they do not want to be above the law.  They want to be covered but they want us to introduce simplification.  However, we have to use electronic administration more often.  In terms of the principle of only once, when one submits a document to the administration, one does not have to submit the same document to the different administrations because the document has already been submitted.<\/p><p> I refer to evaluation of existing legislation, the fitness checks to see if we can get rid of old texts which are no longer necessary, and the impact of legislation on competitiveness.  Community assessment is not a new rule.  It is that this rule comes on top of a number of rules and increases the burden.  There are many things that can be done.  There are many things we are doing.  When the members were in Brussels I informed them about our initiative on the top ten worst pieces of EU law.  We have done the consultation on the website.  We asked people to tell us what are the ten worst EU laws.  We had thousands of replies.  We did a ranking.  I regret to inform the members that one of them, which was under our responsibility, was the REACH legislation, registration of chemicals, which is very burdensome.  Following that, we are reducing the registration fees for SMEs.  We have appointed the special ambassador in the European Chemical Agency to deal with the SME problems, simplification of procedures and to see if we can facilitate that, but this must be done and scrutinised through all areas of legislation.<\/p><p> On facilitating the creation of companies, three days and &euro;100, licensing is an issue.  It is not enough to create the company.  How long does it take to get a licence?<\/p><p> We have a big programme at EU level, and we must lead by example.  We can also have targets.  We used to have a target of 25%.  We exceeded that target but what about putting that target at national or regional level?  What about Governments on taking office saying that when they leave office they will have less of an administrative burden than was the case when they arrived?  That is a challenge.<\/p><p> The Commission is preparing a very important communication for the June European Council.  I will be in a position to send it to the members' Parliament in the coming weeks.  This will be a refit programme on actions we are putting in place to reduce bureaucracy, but it has to be a permanent challenge and it must be introduced in the culture of the Administrations at all levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061100005#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel Calleja Crespo","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402482600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Mr. Calleja Crespo is very welcome.

On access to finance, I agree with Mr. Calleja Crespo that we need different forms of finance outside of banks.  That is one of the major challenges, but how do we do that?  He spoke about disseminating information to SMEs.  Is it possible to do that closer to the people, as in a regional way, as opposed to it being done in our capital city or large areas here such as a county or district?  The issue of funds for entrepreneurships and SMEs is linked somewhat to Europe and would be underwritten by Europe.  That is my first question.<\/p><p>  A subject close to my heart is mentoring.  The two most important areas for me are access to finance and mentoring, or what I call soft supports.  In terms of the digital economy, we could have a closed network mentoring service across Europe.

Is it not the case that currently in Europe there is not a single economy?<\/p> <p>There are, for example, countries that were unaffected by the economic downturn and then there are countries that are struggling to recover from an economic downturn.  Would  Mr. Calleja Crespo not expect two different sets of advice for those economies, rather than a general overall list of things countries ought to be doing?  If the director general has said a little about that, I missed it.  What are the special measures in respect of countries such as Ireland and other countries, typically in southern Europe?  What additional supports are required?  Perhaps the director general has touched on it.

Many of the areas represented by members are rural communities, in which large multinational industries will not be established.

When one talks of entrepreneurs, a major point to come through all the committee's meetings concerns the appetite for risk.  I am conscious it is probably the same across Europe and while the aim is to encourage a lot more youth entrepreneurship, even in the case of existing entrepreneurs one is not simply risking oneself as one is also risking one's family.  During the recession, many business people across Europe who lost their business felt the state let them down and there was no safety net in place to protect them.  While one will not go hungry, the protection is not good enough for someone who takes the risk, pays taxes, employs people and so on.  Such people felt let down and a considerable amount of damage has been done in this regard.  I got the sense there is work to be done to repair that image and not just in Ireland.  If one has a business, one is taking a risk and the State should protect one if it goes wrong for reasons that were not one's own doing, that is, if one acted honestly, as Mr. Calleja Crespo himself noted.  This issue must be addressed because it is one's family and not just oneself who one puts at risk.  For example, it is quite common for banks to seek a personal guarantee, which often involves the family home and the family finances.  I believe this is where the problem lies and this must also be addressed.  In the same vein, I refer to the cost of credit.  Business finance has become more expensive in recent years.  I assume it is the same across Europe and this issue must be addressed because we will be unable to compete on an international stage unless the cost of credit is brought down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061100007#F00700","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402483200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank members of the joint committee who have raised many important points.  I will start with the questions regarding access to finance and how to get new forms of finance.  I believe it is dangerous to do this from the regulators or from government.  This must come from the banking institutions, non-banking institutions and the business community and we are trying to encourage best practice.  We have experience in all the 28 member states, where we are confronted with similar problems, and wish to enhance the exchange of measures that have been working in a particular country, such as certain forms of innovative financing, crowd funding or business angels.  We also must look at the different legal frameworks and the exchange of information is very important because things which are done by one country may be producing good results.  I can give examples of programmes in which countries have decided to institute a credit card for the entrepreneur, which will be facilitated under certain conditions.  If such a measure is good, it can be adapted easily to another country and this is what we are doing through the small to medium-sized enterprise, SME, envoys.  We also need to facilitate the SMEs getting together with the banking and financial institutions to identify the needs and the different products.  This is about bringing them closer to people.  While it is a challenge, I think our new programmes also will facilitate the covering of innovative mechanisms, although they must be submitted.<\/p><p>  As for what the European Union could propose to enhance mentoring, in this regard we have a very positive impression of the Irish senior enterprise programme, which is led by Ireland with partners from the United Kingdom and France.  It was very inspiring and members should know we wish to invite Irish experts to our next sessions.  We will have interactive laboratories because we wish to launch programmes for mentoring towards the end of this year and next year.  In this regard, Ireland has a good, positive experience and so we will be asking you to share it and on this basis to establish a European programme.<\/p><p>  As for the questions on the two categories of economy and how we set advice, we try to do this through the country-specific recommendations.  This is the importance of those recommendations.  We analyse the situation in each country and ascertain what needs to be done if one seeks growth and then the Commission puts forward recommendations.  These are not binding rules but are measures for those who wish to enhance growth in the coming years.  In spite of the differences in the economy with 28 different member states, the problems of SMEs remain very similar.  They are problems of being obliged to deal with bureaucracy, of access to markets and of access to finance.  It is true that countries that are in a better economic position have fewer problems regarding access to finance but when one speaks to them, the banks will tell one there also are fewer projects.  Consequently, the way we have developed is through working with the business associations to identify the needs and then, through the country-specific recommendations, discussing with the countries the way forward.<\/p><p>  As for what can be done about scepticism, I am giving my personal opinion in this regard.  I believe we must listen to the citizens and must respect what they say.  I think the economic crisis has played a role.  The Chairman mentioned there is a perception that many sectors of the population may have been let down because of the economic situation.  We must improve the way in which we work and must listen to the message.  We must be closer to the citizens and I believe we must work to find good solutions at European level to face their problems.<\/p><p>  As for entrepreneurs, young people and the possibility of a guarantee fund for young people-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061100007#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel Calleja Crespo"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402483200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I am sorry, but we must go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061100007#F00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1402483200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>If Mr. Calleja Crespo finishes that point, we can then finish over lunch.

Given the tight timeframe, however, they were not proposed in the exact order desired by the Bills Office.  They deal with the primary issue, that is, the removal of An Post from the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, which brings all of the relevant Social Welfare Acts together and in which specific mention is made of An Post.  Indeed, An Post is given preferential status.  For longer than I can remember, An Post has been the preferred vehicle for the delivery of social welfare payments.  This served a number of purposes.  First, there was a post office in virtually every town and village, which meant easy access for people collecting child benefit, jobseeker's benefit or its equivalent and pensions.  In recent years, this contract with the Government became vital to post offices.<br\/>Second, the preference served a purpose in respect of social welfare.  It helped to reduce the opportunity for fraudulent transactions, for example, where people used multiple IDs or were outside the country.  People had to present at post offices and sign on, especially in small towns.  Even in cities, staff knew who was claiming because people had to present in person, be it once per month in respect of child benefit or once per week in respect of other benefits.  If the Department moves away from this system, there is a danger of a greater degree of fraud being committed.  For example, if a payment is made into a bank account, that account can be accessed from virtually anywhere in the world.<\/p> <p>The Department has encouraged people to present with bank details so a payment can be made in that fashion as an option.  I am of the firm belief that as a fraud control the process should take place in a post office.<\/p><p> I was not present when the Minister responded to my initial comments on Second Stage but I have read that she stated there is no danger to the An Post contract.  There is always a danger as An Post has the contract for two years, with the possibility of another four years, so it could lose the contract in future.  If the amendments from the Minister are accepted, the recognition that being named in legislation gives to An Post will be eroded.  If that happened, many post offices around the country would end up closing, which is a concern that has been raised by the Irish Postmasters' Union which lobbied us recently.  It has not come about just this year because four or five years ago the same concern was raised when the social welfare contract was discussed and up for grabs.  The Minister may be inclined to guarantee this but she is not likely to hold her position forever, and perhaps she will not even hold the office in the near future.  There is, therefore, no guarantee that the preferential treatment An Post has received until now will be protected.<\/p><p> The Minister has also made the argument that EU competition rules demand that we take such a step.  My amendment would reinstate An Post but it would not totally exclude the opportunity to have, as the Minister described, another payment service provider, as that is also mentioned.  An Post may not be able to deliver a service in a particular area, for example.  If Ireland argued for the importance of the post office network, including the social benefits, which we should have done until now in Europe, we would receive some recognition and support.  If required, we should look to change the attitude of Europe to the post office.<\/p><p> I have a brother-in-law involved with the Communication Workers' Union and he has indicated that postal services across Europe have been under severe pressure, with the unions organising in Europe to try to protect the postal delivery service.  Post offices have changed and moved with the times but if they were to lose a contract like this, I doubt that many would survive.  If the public service obligation is on the Government rather than An Post to ensure postal services exist, the only way to guarantee a service is still to deliver it through An Post.  The State could go much further if it wanted to protect a State institution rather than a private company like a bank.  In many ways, the State could put much more money through the accounts of An Post, including wages or grants delivered through An Post, etc.  That would add to An Post's future viability, and given the current state of the country, it would be important.<\/p><p> There is a recognition that changes are being made but my principal point for section 3 is to ensure that current recognition given in legislation to An Post would remain, albeit slightly changed in line with the Minister's comments.  An Post should be a named organisation and therefore have preferential status for any future contracts.  I will be moving my other amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014061100003#B00900","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402488300,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I will be moving amendments Nos. 4 and 8, and I support all the amendments Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive.  With the benefit of reflection, I am unsure whether we will achieve our desired objective but as the previous speaker indicated, that is due to the tight timeframe.  We discussed Second Stage of this Social Welfare and Pensions Bill last week and I received a communication from the Bills Office to ask me to hurry in submitting amendments.  That is despite the fact that there is a specific commitment in the programme for Government to allow at least two weeks for reflection and consideration between Second and Committee Stages of a Bill.  I asked the Taoiseach about it recently and he told me this was a question of priorities.  We are at least 75%, if not more, into the life of this Government and that proposal in the programme for Government is pretty fundamental to the way we do business in the House.  We should not just shunt legislation through like we are producing material in a factory.  I wish the Government would get on and make the appropriate change, as it would help us achieve the time and space to properly draft amendments.<\/p><p>  I would be happy if the Minister could introduce the appropriate amendments to meet the objective we are trying to achieve.  She, along with every Member in these Houses, is aware of the social and economic importance of the post office network to this country.  We are also aware that An Post is under severe pressure, with unavoidable changes in technology and electronic communications resulting in a position where the revenue of all post offices in countries around the world has steadily declined.  An Post is currently heavily dependent on two Government contracts involving the National Treasury Management Agency and the Department of Social Protection.  It is not desirable for a great State organisation like An Post to be unduly dependent on one or two Government contracts.  I am committed to the idea that An Post should diversify and take on more responsibilities, with arrangements perhaps being made for all Government payments to go through it, including motor tax, etc.  An Post could get some banking functions.  We are aware of cases in rural Ireland particularly of bank branches closing but there is An Post infrastructure and services could be provided locally.  Importantly, nothing should be done at this stage to fundamentally undercut the future revenue stream of the post office, because until a Government implements such desirable changes, it is essential for us to maintain what we have.<\/p><p>  I take account of the Minister's reply on Second Stage regarding European rules, etc.  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 is the basic legislation which brought together all the social welfare provisions in 2005, and this Bill is essentially an amendment of that Act.  An Post is specifically mentioned in that legislation.<\/p> <p>In other words, the legislation is framed against a backdrop where An Post is seen as the service provider for social welfare payments.  That is being removed and we oppose it.  One must ask, in a situation that is tenuous, what signal this gives.  It certainly adds fuel to the fire generated by the Irish Postmasters' Union.  I am sure its members will be on the media in the next few days to claim that their worst fears are being realised.  The Government has assured the IPU, both publicly and privately, that it is totally committed to the future of An Post, but this legislation states the opposite.  It is clearing the way and allowing for a situation where the fundamental contract for social welfare payments will be operated through an organisation other than An Post.<\/p><p> I realise there are technical difficulties owing to European regulations and so forth, but this is sending a deplorable signal.  The technological advances the Minister is trying to accommodate in section 3 could be accommodated easily by retaining the reference to An Post.  That would give those who are trying to save An Post and the people who are committed to its future the necessary reassurance.  If the amendments before the Minister are legally inadequate to do the job we wish to do, she should bring forward her own in order that those who have been assured and reassured by various Ministers that they are committed to the future of An Post will see that these reassurances have some weight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014061100004#C00200","speaker":"1059","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402488900,"counter":49,"content":"<p>There are two matters I wish to discuss, the first of which is the broader issue of the time between Second Stage and Committee Stage.  It is unfair that there is such a tight window between the two Stages and there is no reason for it.  There is no urgency for the Bill to be completed by the end of the week.  The idea behind it is that it is supposed to be a more considered measure than the (No. 2) Bill introduced at the end of last year, on which the debate was guillotined by the House.  The Minister will be aware of an issue that has come to the fore in the last couple of days, that the compensation of those who were neglected when under the auspices of the State, for example, young people who were compensated by the HSE owng to neglect, is subject to means assessment by her Department, even though the compensation of every other victim such as the victims of Magdalen laundries and so forth is exempt from calculation under the social welfare system.

It is disappointing that provision has not been made in the legislation and I hope the Minister will reconsider the issue in advance of Report Stage.<\/p><p>  The amendment before us seeks to refer to An Post rather than \"payment service provider\".  There are genuine concerns among the public about the operation and viability of the sub-post office network.  I received a telephone call just before this meeting about Cappataggle sub-post office in County Galway.  It has been given one month stay of execution following the passing of the postmistress.  It is not good enough that a guillotine automatically hangs over a sub-post office as soon as the postmaster or postmistress passes away.<\/p><p>  There is a far greater argument for the retention of the sub-post office network than has been articulated to date - to deal with the issue of fraud which has been mentioned by previous speakers.

A sum of &euro;332 million was calculated in control savings last year based on the actions of that section of the Department.  The staff do tremendous work, but it would be interesting to examine the level and frequency of fraud in respect of payments collected by electronic means and through banks, payments collected in the major post offices and sub-post offices.  I suspect that any such analysis would quickly show that there was far less fraud taking place in respect of payments collected in sub-post offices.  The postmaster or postmistress knows the individuals who come to the sub-post office to collect these payments.  Given the focus on fraud - it is correct that there should be such a focus - the sub-post office network has an important role to play, a role that has been ignored up to now.  Person-to-person payments were reintroduced by the Minister's predecessor, former Deputy Mary Hanafin, because of the level of fraud perpetrated through the electronic payments system.<\/p><p>  There is another matter that is ignored, even though it could help to improve efficiency not only in the Minister's Department but also in others.  It is far more efficient to process an application submitted online and many Government agencies, including the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in respect of driving licences, are trying to incentivise people to submit their applications in this way.  However, there is a problem with a cohort of people who are unable to use these online systems.  In the case of social welfare, I suspect that the vast majority of applications are made on hard copy.  If the Department gave postmasters and postmistresses a role in assisting with the submission of applications online, it would streamline and speed up the processing of these applications within the Department and ensure all of the required documentation was provided from the start, reducing the need for follow-up queries.  Giving postmasters and postmistresses a direct role in that regard would make it far more difficult for another operator to compete directly with the local post office network in providing that service.<\/p><p>  That brings me to the excuse made, that it must be open to everybody owing to EU competition rules.  The Minister could set very simple criteria which would benefit the delivery of the service, one of which could be that the operator have a minimum number of outlets and that they be located not just in local towns but also serve rural communities.  Many of the major retailers will be unable to compete on that level.  The operator could be required to assist people in filling in forms and submitting them online.  Many operators would be unable to deal with this.<\/p><p>  Another matter that is ignored is that postmasters and postmistresses must sign the Official Secrets Act.  Many of the other service providers being proposed would not have to do this.  We are talking about very personal and private information and people do not necessarily wish it to be known that they are in receipt of a social assistance payment.  Based on the level of the social assistance payment they receive, one can quickly calculate their other income.  That issue must be taken into account in any provision made regarding the roll-out of a payments collection function to other service providers.<\/p><p>  These issues have been ignored to a great extent by the Department to date.<\/p> <p>I ask and urge the Minister to reconsider those issues and consider the amendment that has been put forward here.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014061100005#D00400","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402489500,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I do not know whether I have to but I will declare before the debate that I was a post office clerk and a member of the Communications Workers Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014061100006#E00200","speaker":"1193"},{"type":"speech","time":1402489500,"counter":54,"content":"<p>The Deputy is not now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014061100006#E00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1402489500,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I fully support the amendments put forward by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  The fact that An Post has been omitted from the 2005 Consolidation Act is the key thing.  An Post should be allowed remain in the legislation in order to allow for the continuation of the Consolidation Act.  An Post, as a potential service provider, should not be taken out of the legislation.<\/p><p> I have said a lot on this matter that I will not repeat here.  It is a fact that 18% of Irish people do not have bank accounts and 23% do not have Internet access.  There is a social aspect to An Post and its 1,100 post offices serve the population very well.  As has been said, An Post gives people an opportunity to interact with staff and pay bills by making small payments of &euro;10 or &euro;15 which is very important when people are experiencing straitened times and must carefully budget in order to pay bills.  <\/p><p>  An Post should be included in the legislation.  I do not see why the Minister cannot leave it in because leaving it in will not cause a major problem.  Taking An Post out of it is a negative signal, particularly to post office workers.  A commitment was given in the programme for Government to do as much as possible to keep post offices vibrant in any way possible.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Naughten's point about the tendering process.  Aspects of the process can request that a service provider meet the level of service provided by post offices.  An Post has 1,100 outlets that provide services to 38% of the population.  People can get assistance to fill out forms, etc. in the post office which is an important social service and, therefore, should protect the services within the post office network.  It is not a question of me, or other Deputies, having a quintessential affection for the post office.  The truth is they play a key role in urban and rural communities.  Therefore, the Minister should accept Deputy O'Snodaigh's amendments.   <\/p><p>  An Post can develop services.  When I worked in the post office staff were asked whether they wanted their wages paid into their bank accounts.  Many of us opted to have our wages paid into our post office savings accounts, an arrangement that worked very well.  An Post can provide a similar service in other instances and it is an option that could be examined.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014061100006#E00400","speaker":"1193"},{"type":"speech","time":1402489500,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contribution on the issue, particular of An Post which is a very important issue.  We seem to agree that An Post services are very important from an economic, commercial and social point of view.  I am glad to hear Deputies support An Post.  I am sure that An Post will appreciate their support and the fact that they see the social and commercial role that it plays.<\/p><p>  The timescale for the publication of the Bill was raised by Deputy Naughten, and I think Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh referred to it on Second Stage.  I want to explain one point.  The timescales involved in progressing most social welfare and pension Bills are dictated by the need to implement various measures agreed in the annual budget, within the required times.  The time available between the publication of Bill and progressing through the Oireachtas is, therefore, dictated by when the annual budget is announced, and when the various budgetary measures are to come into force.  As has been said in recent years, these time pressures have been eased somewhat by bringing the budget day back to mid-October, at the latest, instead of early December.  This allows for the social welfare budget Bill to be published earlier and more time for the Bill to be considered, by the Oireachtas, before the normal early January implementation dates for many of the measures.<\/p><p>  The main reason this Bill needs to be enacted before the summer recess is in order to comply with the 5 August 2014 deadline for the transposition of Articles 7 and 8 of the EU Directive 2010\/41.  The directive provides equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity - and we have discussed this matter on a number of occasions at this committee - in so far as it relates to ensuring that the spouse or civil partner of a self-employed worker can benefit from social protection in accordance with national law.  That means that we are introducing into law in Ireland, for the first time, the right of the spouse of a self-employed person or worker, who is involved in the business, to access social insurance.  That means, as I said on Second Stage, that they can access a contributory pension.  That is particularly important because many of the spouses are likely to be women.  They can access maternity benefit.  They can also access widows' or widowers' pensions.  We reckon that there may be about 5,000 people who will avail of this provision, of which the majority will be women.  <\/p><p>  The date by which the Bill must be enacted is 5 August.  I understand that people would like more time.  However, implementing the directive will be of significant benefit to a lot of small businesses around the country where there is a couple working in the small business.  I just wanted to make the point about the date of the deadline which faces this Bill.<\/p><p>  With regard to section 3, I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 8 and 9 and shall explain why.  There may be a slight misunderstanding on the part of some of the Deputies.  I share everybody's view, who has spoken, that An Post provides a valuable service and we want to see it retained.  <\/p><p>  I was delighted to sign a contract with An Post last December.  The service is valued by our clients in social protection, communities and by people here in the Houses.  The contract was awarded to An Post following a public procurement contract.  Section 3 updates the legal framework behind the new contract.  It strengthens the role that An Post plays as an integral part of a robust and a proactive payments regime.  There is a legal reasoning behind it.  <\/p><p>  The aim of the draft legislation being proposed is to remove the specification of An Post from primary legislation and move to a more objective approach to reflect the reality of the contract in place.  The position of An Post as a provider of cash payments is set out in enormous detail in the regulations, in the secondary legislation.  <\/p><p>  An Post is an independent contractor, subject to contractual responsibilities, rights and remedies, in the delivery of the cash services to the Department of Social Protection's social welfare clients.  It delivers these services to a very high quality and to a very large number of our clients who are located up and down the country.  They, in turn, are very supportive and appreciative of its service.<\/p><p>  I understand the motive behind the amendments but the ones proposed by the Deputies could be viewed as seeking to ring-fence the role of An Post as the only possible payment service provider for the Department.  This cannot be supported because that would be legally very unsafe and could be interpreted as being contrary to EU directives on fair competition, procurement and State aid.  That is exactly the opposite, having listened to the discussion, of what the Deputies clearly desire.  <\/p> <p>The removal of the specification of An Post from the existing legislation does not interfere with the service.  It does not diminish or jeopardise it.  The contract, which I signed with the chief executive of An Post before Christmas, is now in place and will remain in place for up to six years.  The services must then be re-advertised.  It is open to any player in the market to enter a bid to deliver the services.  These are the rules we must abide by and that is what the legislation must reflect.  We cannot sanction any perception that An Post enjoys a legal status in primary legislation that could be viewed by others, who might contest An Post's winning the contract, as restrictive in so far as it relates to welfare payments.  I understand and appreciate the motives of Deputies' comments but this is the legal advice available to us.  As the legislation stands, it could be perceived that fees were not being charged for services to specific standards but, rather, that expenses are being paid in an agreement entered into by me, as Minister, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and An Post without public advertisement.  This is contrary to what actually happened.  This is what someone who wished to contest the winning of the contract by An Post could allege.  Deputies have enough experience of situations like this arising with other contracts.  This is not the reality and the revisions to the legislation are proposed to reflect this.<\/p><p> Protecting the integrity of expenditure is critical at Government and departmental level.  The key is tackling fraud and abuse within the social welfare system.  We must ensure the necessary legislation is in place to support An Post to carry out its duties in this regard, as agreed under the contract.  The current amendments enhance our opportunities and allow for more stringent fraud and control measures to be carried out by An Post in conjunction with the Department.  For example, the amendments provide An Post with the power to withhold payments to a client if it is not satisfied the person presenting has adequately authenticated his or her identity.  They enable An Post to confiscate a public services card or social services card and surrender it in instances of fraud or where it considers the card is not being used lawfully.  Everyone here, and Deputy Joan Collins more than most, has been in post office and has seen post office queues when people are collecting various payments.  The role of An Post in respect of checking identities and verifying that payments are going to the right people is critical to deterring and detecting fraud but we must include it in legislation.  It is a key service specified in the contract as part of the conditions for whoever wins the contract.  We are updating the legislation to include the provision in the legislation.  It was not done before and the informal arrangement was that An Post might check.  People familiar with post offices know this but we are including it in the contract as a requirement.<\/p><p> As Minister, preventing and detecting fraud and error is critical to saving money that people pay in PAYE and PRSI for a good social welfare service.  People want to ensure the payments go to the right people and we have had conversations about this before.  It is now reflected in the legislation.  The legislation also strengthens the capacity for an exchange of information between the Department and An Post, which is critical, and such exchanges will be invaluable to officers in my Department when cases are being prepared for prosecution.  This is important work in terms of the relationship with the post office and the requirements in the contract for this work to be undertaken.  It is important that, if these situations arise, it is possible for An Post to communicate with the Department properly and legally on such matters.  The proposals provide a new resilience and robustness to underpin the cash payment services on a statutory basis.  I assure Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh and O'Dea and others that the proposals strengthen the position of An Post.  The contract gives some certainty to An Post in the delivery of cash services, enabling it to build from a firm foundation for potential future contracts.  Every Member in the room knows that, under EU procurement laws, it must be put out a contract.  This provides a firm base and a resilience that An Post will be in position to continue to bid should it wish, as I assume it will, to bid for future contracts.<\/p><p> No other Department has given any certainty on the future of the An Post business model but, because it is so important to me as Minister and to the Department as a provider of services, we have thoughtfully looked at how to ensure that, legally, different elements of the service are underpinned, subject to having robust legislation and regulations that meet EU procurement laws.  The position of An Post as a provider of cash payments is set out in detailed regulations in secondary legislation.  Amendments to these regulations in respect of payment service providers will continue to recognise and reflect the position of An Post as a provider of cash payments.<\/p><p> A number of Deputies referred to An Post becoming involved in the provision of other services.  In recent legislation I updated the household budgeting regulations to enhance that service if customers of An Post wish to avail of it.  I have taken a number of steps as Minister and dealt with the EU requirements.  Deputy Willie O'Dea is familiar with the case taken by another party, which contested the An Post position.  The ruling of the EU court was to make a requirement for a competition.  An Post entered the competition and won the contract for two years, renewable for a further four years, and I hope that with this legislation underpinning the services it provides it will continue to be interested in providing important business services for the Department.<\/p> <p>My Department is a significant customer of An Post's services, in terms of both mail delivery and the contract for the delivery of social welfare payments in cash.  To give the Deputies an indication of the scale and volume of the business, during 2013 An Post handled 14 million mail items to a value of &euro;11.5 million for us, as well as some 43.7 million over-the-counter cash payment transactions with a value of over &euro;57 million.  It is a very important segment of the services we provide to the customers and clients of the Department and is extremely significant business for An Post.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014061100006#E00500","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402490700,"counter":59,"content":"<p>The Minister made a point about fraud.  We have had this debate previously.  I believe the Minister places an over-emphasis on fraud and that it is not as bad as she suggests.  The vast majority of people are not trying to devise ways to defraud the system.  While I have no problem with including mechanisms to reduce the possibilities for defrauding the State, a significant proportion of the &euro;332 million referred to by the Minister is not related to fraud but to errors and accidental overpayments.  I was contacted recently by a person who collected his father's old age pension because his father has been ill for a long time.  He has been going to the same post office, using ID that was signed by the police.  He does not have a passport or driving licence.  However, instructions have been sent to An Post from the Department to the effect that if staff do not intervene in cases of suspected fraud, then An Post could be liable for any money lost.  As a result, staff in post offices are coming down much more heavily on people, and this individual was refused payment of his father's pension for about five weeks until we intervened on his behalf.  When the Department requires organisations to be more diligent and insists that people be required to produce passports or other specific types of identification, that can have knock-on effects.

I welcomed the fact that the budget was brought forward to October.  I have been my party's spokesperson on social protection for some time and have had to deal with guillotines being applied to virtually every social welfare Bill in the last ten or 12 years.  On rare occasions, the No. 2 Bill or the Bill that usually appears in May or June has allowed us some time to consider the legislation properly.  The Minister might remember that last year we still ended up with a guillotine, despite the fact that the budgetary change was supposed to allow us to have a number of weeks, if not months, in which to consider social welfare legislation - from October to December.  However, because the Government had lost its majority in the Seanad, it brought the Bill forward, guillotined it and forced us to deal with the legislation without proper time and consideration.<\/p><p>  In this instance, there is only one aspect that requires the haste that we are seeing with this Bill - namely, section 16, which the Minister rightly said refers to the EU directive from 2010.  The directive was passed on 7 July 2010 and was supposed to be implemented within two years.  The Minister sought an extension of two years.  Despite the fact that the directive was passed in 2010, the Government has failed in all of the legislation enacted in the two years since 2012 to address it and now, at the last minute, we are addressing it.  It is not our fault that this Bill is being rushed.  The Bill itself, in the main, other than the section we are dealing with here, is not very controversial and should not take a lot of time to debate.  In fact, section 16 itself is not particularly controversial and could have been a standalone Bill in itself, albeit a very short one, which would allow us to pass the directive.  Most of what is contained in the Bill is a tidying up of other legislation and the social welfare code and could have been included in other social welfare legislation to be debated now or in the future.  <\/p><p>  The timeframe is very tight for the Department, the Bills Office and ourselves in terms of putting together amendments and dealing with the complexity of the social welfare code.  One has to access other legislation and try to track back over the changes.  It is a pity that this aspect of the Government's promise in the programme for Government is being flouted again.  <\/p><p>  To turn to the issue at hand,there is obvious merit in some of these changes.  It is important to ensure a good exchange of information between An Post and the Department so that An Post has the ability to deter fraud, along with the Department itself.  I welcome that aspect, but the problem is that An Post is being deleted from the primary legislation and is being replaced with the term \"payment service provider\".   There is an inherent danger in that.  An Post won the contract, but part of winning it was that it was specified in legislation that it was the payment provider.<\/p> <p>If it had not won it, the Minister would have had to change the legislation because it would no longer have been able to address what was set out in law.  If nothing else, I believe it has to have prepared bidder status, given the recognition of its role.  The role may be economic and commercial but, in particular, it is a social role.  There is no guarantee that anyone else who may win the contract in the future in six years' time would have the same attitude and ethos of An Post.  From what the Minister has said so far, she is treating An Post as just a commercial entity rather than as an integral part of a public service delivery mechanism.  It is not similar to Bank of Ireland or Rabobank, and that difference needs to be recognised.  That is what was acknowledged in legislation.  The effect of section 3(b) is to delete the provisions of section 5(4) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 whereby: &quot;Any expenses incurred by An Post under <i>Part 2 <\/i>(determined on the basis that may be agreed on between the Minister, the Minister for Finance and An Post) shall be paid by the Minister out of the Social Insurance Fund to An Post...&quot;.  In effect, the Minister is deleting the reference to An Post and substituting &quot;a payment service provider&quot;.  This is repeated further on when the Minister deletes from section 242(1)<i>(c)<\/i>the words &quot;in consultation with An Post, the payment of specified benefits through An Post&quot; and substitutes &quot;the payment of specified benefits through a payment service provider&quot;, and in the insertion by section 3(<i>f<\/i>) of the phrase &quot; &lsquo;specified agency&rsquo; means a payment service provider...&quot; instead of the original definition in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, which states: &quot; &quot;specified agency&quot; means An Post...&quot;.  The Minister may seek to continue the good relationship with An Post as the preferred agency but another Minister may not in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014061100008#G00700","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402491300,"counter":66,"content":"<p>It may be dangerous to suggest that the State prefers any tenderer when it is an open tender competition under EU rules.

The movement in European thinking away from the concept of a social Europe and towards a commercial Europe is a danger.

That is the reason I have argued against the putting out to tender of the delivery of unemployment services through JobPath.  This again undermines a public service when one starts to commercialise it by putting JobPath out to tender.  The result of that tender will potentially undermine the delivery of services in the public good, as it is opening up all services to a commercial entity.

Why publish the Bill when one knows one will have to rush the debate on amendments in order to meet the deadline?  Surely the Bill could have been published earlier?  There is a commitment in the programme for Government, as the Minister is well aware, that there be at least a fortnight between the Second and Committee Stages of a Bill.  It comes down to publishing the Bill in time so that there will be a reasonable gap between the Second Stage debate and the consideration of amendments.<\/p><p>  The Minister states she is strengthening the position of An Post through the changes she is making here today and that An Post is very strongly represented in the secondary legislation.  It seems a bit perverse to me.  Up to now, An Post was specifically mentioned in the primary legislation, and the Minister now proposes to take it out of the primary legislation, yet she maintains she is strengthening its position.  The Minister's contention seems to boil down to the argument that if one does not take out the reference to An Post from the primary legislation, then the contract being entered into is vulnerable to a challenge.  I do not accept that argument.  The Minister states that it might be challenged and that it could be interpreted as being contrary to this or that aspect of an EU directive.  Are we not great Europeans?  We in this sovereign State must legislate in such a way that there is no possibility whatsoever that anything we do could even be challengeable.  I think a great deal more work should have been done on this and we should have had more discussion with the relevant staff in the legal affairs section of the European Commission, because there is no doubt that this sends out a horrendous signal to the workers with An Post, to the postmasters and to people who genuinely fear for the future of An Post.  All of us have attended large public meetings.  The net reality of the legislation is that the law is being changed to allow for the possibility that even the social welfare contract will be handed to somebody else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014061100009#H01200","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1402491900,"counter":77,"content":"<p>On the reference to An Post in the principal legislation, will the Minister consider the possibility of introducing an amendment on Report Stage to provide for the retention of this reference, perhaps followed by the words \"or any other payment service provider\" or similar text?

That An Post will have the contract for the next six years is welcome.  Could the legislation include a requirement on the minimum number of pay-out points to be provided under the contract?  Such a provision would narrow the field and, I am sure, position An Post at the head of the group of contenders given the number of pay-out points available to it.<\/p><p>  Post offices in rural areas must be supported by local people, which means they must use them for more than receiving payments.  They should, for example, buy goods in shops where the post office is located.  Having a post office and shop in one location does not guarantee that the shop will remain open.  People should be mindful of the need to support the shops in which post offices are located. <\/p><p>  With the abolition of town councils, post offices should play a much greater role in communities, for example, in terms of parking fines.

As such, the contract will include the specification the Deputies suggested.  To tender for the contract, the bidder must have the potential to have a wide and relatively dense coverage of points at which the services may be provided.  While An Post is in a position to meet this specification, many other potential tenderers will not be able to meet this requirement.  <\/p><p>  The import of Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's comments is that clients of the Department should be forced to visit a post office in person to collect social welfare payments.  Clients of the Department have been offered a choice of payment for some time.  Many people who retire and have been in employment - this relates to an issue discussed earlier - are likely to have a bank account.  Such persons are likely to indicate a preference for having a retirement pension or other payment made to a specified bank account.  It would be interesting to ascertain how many of the Deputies present collect child benefit in person at their local post office.  The general evidence shows that when people apply for child benefit, applicants with a bank account tend to opt to use that option.<\/p><p>  This is another area An Post has sought to develop by expanding and developing the range of banking type services it provides.  I hope the company will address this issue developmentally because there is no doubt, as Deputy Joan Collins noted, that significant numbers of people are not comfortable with electronic banking and are comfortable collecting cash payments.  The Department recognises this and hence the emphasis on the widespread availability of a cash payment service.<\/p><p>  For at least two decades, people on retirement pensions or in receipt of child benefit have been able to nominate a bank account for payment and those who have bank accounts tend to avail of this option.  The collection of a payment in person is applicable primarily to jobseekers.  As the Minister with responsibility for addressing fraud, I am anxious that this continue because an issue arises in respect of proof of identity.  In a number of cases people have been found to have had other people collect payments on their behalf.  The Department has introduced controls in airports and so forth to detect people residing outside the jurisdiction who are visiting the country to collect payments to which they were no longer properly entitled.  We stop such payments and, where appropriate, prosecute the individuals in question.  I introduced the legislation necessary to carry out this function because all taxpayers, whether in work or otherwise, contribute taxes and PRSI to pay for a good, solid social welfare system.  They demand and are entitled to a high level of reassurance that the Department will seek, when making payments of almost &euro;20 billion per annum, to keep fraud and error to a minimum.  <\/p><p>  On the latter point, the most recent figures, which are for 2012, show that &euro;97 million was recovered.  The overall level of error is approximately 8% and 42% of this is accounted for by suspected fraud.  Third party error by the customer, that is, where he or she makes a misstatement or error, accounts for a further 37% and departmental errors account for approximately 8%.  Cases involving it transpired that people had been left a significant estate and were collecting payments to which they were not entitled accounted for the remaining 13%.  Recoveries in these areas continue to be significant and amounted to approximately &euro;97 million in 2012. <\/p><p>  I am aware that Deputy O'Dea was a legal practitioner.  He will be aware, therefore, that in 2007, the contract held by An Post was challenged.  This challenge was not a figment of someone's imagination and further challenges could be taken.  Given that the Deputy was a member of the Government at that time perhaps he will indicate, subject to Cabinet confidentiality requirements, whether that issue and what could be done to secure An Post's future position were discussed.  There were no indications of this when I arrived in the Department.  However, the contract was challenged in 2007.  While I understand the motives of the Deputies, the position of the contract in law must be resilient.<\/p> <p>Critical to the contract is the spread of services but also the provision of vital services now included in law that strengthen the position of the service provider, An Post, in the role of detecting fraud and errors and probably, more importantly, deterring fraud and errors.  People will know that when they go to the local post office, there will be an eagle eye and that if somebody's first cousin or somebody else shows up, that person will be questioned to have their identity and entitlement to the payment checked.  I can understand the reason the Deputy's constituent was upset when they were challenged to have their identity checked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014061100010#J00300","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402492500,"counter":81,"content":"<p>The payment was stopped for four weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014061100011#K00200","speaker":"1193"},{"type":"speech","time":1402492500,"counter":82,"content":"<p>We are talking about very large sums of money.

This is a technical amendment proposed by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in the light of certain provisions contained in sections 5 and 10.  Section 5 relates to refunds of employer PRSI contributions in respect of certain seafarers.  Section 10 provides for changes in the application of the habitual residence condition for entitlement to certain social welfare payments.

FLAC suggests that section 8(4) be removed and revised to ensure all families in need of an adequate income to support their children be treated equally with regard to eligibility for family income supplement, regardless of the relationship status of the parents.  This is a much broader proposal than what was intended by the Minister but it is worth considering.  My proposal may be able to capture some of those points.

It is an issue that has caused a great deal of confusion and is something I encounter regularly in my constituency office.  However, in its submission on the Bill, the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, point out that the wording of the provision is unnecessarily opaque and may actually lead to further confusion and misinterpretation by decision makers.  The submission highlights a lack of clarity as to whether the provisions refer only to persons and their family members who have been less than 12 months in their host countries or to all workers.  This is clearly a complex area of policy and we should, as in all legislation, be seeking to simplify the language, if at all possible, without undermining the intention.<br\/>The Department should have the ability to take action to ensure social welfare payments are only made to those persons who are entitled to them.  We are all agreed on that and it is something I have consistently encouraged.  We have some concern, however, regarding the eventual outworking of these provisions and whether additional safeguards might be necessary.  We must avoid a scenario where an unfair burden is placed on people by requiring them repeatedly to jump through hoops to prove their habitual residence.  Once a person has proved that status, he or she should not have to keep doing so every few months, with all of the bureaucracy that entails.  People should not be reluctant to leave the State to visit relatives, for example, for fear their payments will be cut off.<br\/>The provisions in section 10 seem at first reading to address concerns that have been raised in this regard over the years.  I welcome these changes in the main.  This is a complicated area of policy, as I said, which is further complicated by our EU membership and the implications of the common travel area.  The phrase &quot;social welfare tourism&quot; often comes up in discussions of this issue.  Certainly, we should not facilitate people who would come here to avail of a beneficial social welfare system, but that must be set against our responsibilities as a developed state to ensure that people who come here to work and who pay taxes in this State also benefit from our social protection provision.  In fairness, the change to the existing regime set out in this section will address some of the difficulties in this regard.  We must ensure, however, that the provisions are enforced properly across the board.  One of the problems heretofore is that there has been a variety of interpretations by deciding officers in different parts of the country, with those interpretations being subsequently overturned by the social welfare appeals office in some cases.<br\/>My amendment proposes that the Minister would produce regulations governing the method by which the requirement in regard to habitual residence will be controlled or verified.  It is a simple amendment and I am interested in the Minister's view of whether I have put the right construction on it.  If the issue I am raising is already captured in law and I have read the provision incorrectly, I look forward to her clarification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014061100015#O00400","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1402494300,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I do not propose to accept this amendment.

These five factors are derived from EU legislation, namely, Article 11 of Regulation 987\/2009, and from European Court of Justice jurisprudence, including the 1997 Swaddling case and the Knock case, C-102\/91, among others.<br\/>My Department has produced extensive guidelines on the habitual residence condition, which are freely available to all staff members and the public.

Section 246 1(c) extends this provision to family members of workers or self-employed people who are EU or EEA citizens.  Directive 2004\/38\/EC extends some worker status rights to EU and EEA citizens who have involuntarily become unemployed or are temporarily unable to work because of illness or accidental injury.<br\/>Certain conditions apply to the retention of worker status rights.  For example, a person wishing to retain status must register as unemployed and fulfil any conditions attaching to that registration.  The length of time worker or self-employed status is retained depends on the length of the preceding employment or fixed-term employment contract.  A person who has become involuntarily unemployed within the first 12 months of employment or after completion of a fixed-term contract of less than one year and who has registered as unemployed retains worker status for no less than six months.  Such a person may be entitled to claim a means-tested allowance from the State without having to satisfy the habitual residence condition, HRC.  Currently when that person loses his or her worker status the Department has no way to review his or her habitual residence condition and this is the net point.  Subsection 1(<i>d<\/i>) will give the Department the power to review the HRC of a person who has lost worker status to ensure that condition and any other relevant condition is met throughout the duration of any claim for a means-tested payment.<br\/>Section 246 (1)(<i>e<\/i>) extends those powers of review to family members whose HRC rights are derived from the worker status of the principal worker.  It should be noted that the review or application of the habitual residence condition does not mean that someone who has lost worker status or rights derived therefrom will fail to satisfy the HRC as each case will be dealt with on its own merits using the five factors and any other circumstance that appears relevant.  A person who has been in employment for a period longer than 12 months retains worker status for a longer, but not indefinite, period.  The host member state is entitled to impose conditions other than those relating to habitual residence for entitlement to means-tested payments that conform with those imposed on nationals of that host member state.  For example, we require people on jobseeker's allowance to make themselves available for work.  This simply ensures that if a person is staying in a state, and qualifies, he or she will be subject to the same conditions as a national, long-term resident or citizen of the host member state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014061100016#P00400","speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1402494900,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1402494900,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Sections 11 to 13, inclusive, agreed to<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1402494900,"counter":149,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1402494900,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 14:<blockquote><br \/>In page 16, after line 35, to insert the following:<br \/><b>&ldquo;Making and termination of appointments<\/b><br \/><b>14. <\/b>The Principal Act is amended&mdash;(a) in section 250&mdash;<blockquote>(i) in subsection (1), by inserting the following after &ldquo;those appointments&rdquo;:<blockquote>&ldquo;and the Minister may at any time terminate an appointment under this subsection whether or not the appointment was for a fixed period&rdquo;,<\/blockquote>(ii) by inserting the following subsections after subsection (1):<blockquote>&ldquo;(1A) An appointment as a social welfare inspector shall cease&mdash;<blockquote>(a) if the Minister terminates the appointment,<br \/>(b) if it is made for a fixed period, on the expiry of that period, or<br \/>(c) if the person ceases to be an officer of the Minister.<\/blockquote>(1B) A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seconded by the Minister for a purpose referred to in subsection (1) has conferred on him or her all the powers and duties conferred on a social welfare inspector by this section and may exercise those powers and duties under and in accordance with this Act.<br \/>(1C) A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercising a power or duty of a social welfare inspector shall continue to be under the general direction and control of the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br \/>(1D) A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercising a power or duty of a social welfare inspector shall continue to have conferred on him or her and may exercise the powers and duties of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for purposes other than the purposes of this Act, as well as for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo;,<\/blockquote>(iii) by inserting the following subsection after subsection (7):<blockquote>&ldquo;(7A) A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seconded by the Minister for a purpose referred to in subsection (1) shall be given a certificate of his or her secondment, and on entering any premises or place for the purposes of Parts 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 12 and this Part shall, if so requested, produce that certificate.&rdquo;,<\/blockquote>and<br \/>(iv) in subsection (16), by deleting &ldquo;in uniform&rdquo; in each place where it occurs,<br \/>and<\/blockquote>(b) in section 299&mdash;<blockquote>(i) in subsection (2), by inserting the following after &ldquo;such allowance&rdquo;:<blockquote>&ldquo;and the Minister may at any time terminate an appointment under this subsection whether or not the appointment was for a fixed period&rdquo;,<\/blockquote>and<br \/>(ii) by inserting the following subsection after subsection (2):<blockquote>&ldquo;(3) An appointment as a designated person under subsection (2) shall cease&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) if the Minister terminates the appointment,<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) if it is made for a fixed period, on the expiry of that period, or<br \/>(<i>c<\/i>) where the person is an officer of the Minister, if that person ceases to be an officer of the Minister.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>This provides for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to exercise, where appropriate, the powers and duties of social welfare inspectors.

It is not the case that every official of the State at a checkpoint is out of uniform and undercover.

For instance, people might be familiar with the fact that there is multi-agency co-operation in regard to taxi ranks to ensure that the people who are on taxi ranks are properly registered for the purposes of income tax, employment and PRSI.  The multi-agency has been an important development in saving taxpayers in terms of fraud and detecting fraud.  The garda&iacute; will retain their warrant card and their authorisation.<\/p><p>  In the case of the CAB there are specific powers under the CAB legislation and, as the Deputy is aware, social welfare officers work with and within the CAB and are seconded to it.  In this particular case the garda&iacute; are coming into the Department of Social Protection to beef up the capacity of the Department in investigations and detection.  It will allow the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to exercise the powers and duties of a social welfare inspector and it facilitates them being seconded to the Department to assist with and undertake fraud investigation work.  The garda&iacute; who are seconded will be provided with powers.  This will enable them to work as and with inspectors from the Department's special investigation unit.  They will perform relevant social welfare investigation functions but will remain garda&iacute; as well.  Officers will investigate, collate and assemble suitable evidence to enable a deciding or designated officer to review an entitlement to social welfare payments and in certain circumstances to use this in legal proceedings.  <\/p><p>  We are doing this to enhance the investigative functions of the Department for the purposes of the control of fraud in social welfare schemes.  This sanction has been provided for these temporary assignments.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has approved the secondment of 20 Garda officers for assignment to the unit and people will know that the special investigations unit is headquartered in Carrick-on-Shannon and also operates in areas where there may be specific risks.  During the period I have been Minister I have examined how we can support the people in the special investigations unit to ensure that with a spend of &euro;20 billion we deter fraud, that if fraud occurs on a small-scale basis and where it is significant that we prosecute, and that we send out a message that the Department of Social Protection is not a soft touch in regard to fraud and abuse.  I feel very strongly that not only do I have responsibility to people such as our retired people in regard to social welfare payments but that I have an enormous responsibility to taxpayers paying income tax and PRSI who want to see social welfare money directed particularly to the people who qualify and to those who need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014061100017#Q00200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1402495500,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the time and I will not delay the debate other than to say that I will return to this matter on Report Stage.

I am not talking about people who are guilty or fraud but a person who, on the other hand, might owe money to the Department because of a genuine error on their part or on the part of Department, and sometimes if a person becomes entitled to a lump sum there might be a pressing need.  We are talking about people by and large who are living on social welfare.  There might be a pressing need for a lump sum outlay on, say, an essential item of household furniture or due to some illness.  I am not objecting to the idea that if one owes the Department money or<i>vice versa<\/i>, that one payment can be offset against the other, but each individual situation should be considered and the priority should be to be to get back money somebody owes the Department by way of instalments.  The Department can now seek up to 15% of the principal payment per week.  We had a briefing from some of the Minister's officials a week or two ago and I understand that this will be the practice - that offsetting a statutory lump sum against a lump sum owed will be exceptional.

People apply to their bank or credit union on the basis that they will get the money back by way of the grant in six months time.  If in the meantime the State, under this provision, makes a call on that money, the person concerned would have the expectation of obtaining a grant of, say, &euro;3,000 for insulation and suddenly the State, having discovering something untoward whether through its fault or the fault of the person, can take that &euro;3,000, leaving the person high and dry without any ability to make their repayment.  We should be careful to ensure that in such circumstances money in respect of grants that are payable, be it a sustainable energy grant, disability grant or other grant, should not be taken straightaway.

It should not be used for the purpose outlined or should not be the primary source of funding it.  I hope the Minister will come back on Report Stage to deal with the broader issue I raised with her privately and in the House, namely, that the payments in question &ndash; there are only a handful of them &ndash; should be excluded from the social welfare calculation in the same way as compensation payments made to women under the Magdalen laundries redress scheme.

The recovery of overpayments is important.  My recollection is that last year it amounted to &euro;73 million.  If one thinks about something that is properly prized in the social welfare system such as the free travel scheme, the cost of that to the Department is &euro;77 million.

I will put the matter in context so that when we discuss individual questions later, we will see the limits of what the Union does and the constraints that apply to it, in addition to the possibilities for making progress.<\/p><p>  Within the European Union, we are constrained by the legal bases that are provided for under the treaties.  In practical terms, this means that the sort of work we do in the department I represent is on customs, indirect tax and direct tax.  I mention this because it gives an indication of the degree to which the European Union has advanced towards greater integration, bearing in mind the different elements of these taxes.  The customs union, for instance, is a customs union in the sense that it is entirely an EU competence.  It is ruled by regulations agreed by all member states in Brussels and which are directly applicable.  In the case of indirect taxation, we have a treaty basis which provides specifically for the harmonisation of indirect taxation and particularly value-added tax on the basis of the need to ensure the functioning of the internal market, which is the EU's internal market without borders, and taking into account the need to avoid distortions of competition. <\/p><p>  Direct taxation is in a different category because there is no formal legal basis for binding legislation other than the general mechanism providing for the approximation of laws dealing with the functioning of the internal market.  That is an important context into which to put any proposal of the Commission because it puts a framework around what the Commission can propose and what is likely to be agreed by the member states.  The other point is that, for binding legislation, we require unanimity among all member states.  A particular piece of binding legislation - on direct taxation - cannot be passed without the agreement of all.<\/p><p>  Within the area of direct taxation, corporate taxation in particular, which I understand is the subject of the committee's discussions, there is an amount of already-existing EU legislation, but it is quite small.  It relates largely to the issue of avoiding double taxation.  In particular, there is a directive on cross-border mergers, one on parent subsidiaries and one on interest and royalties, the idea being to simplify transactions within the Union.<\/p><p>  The area that may have been subject to the most progress in recent years has, in fact, concerned co-operation between tax administrations.  There is a quite developed corpus of legislation on how tax administrations can help each other in ensuring their tax laws are respected.  This extends from the extreme of automatic exchange of information on investor income for individuals to the area of assistance in the recovery of taxes between different jurisdictions in the Union.<\/p><p>  One of the driving forces in the work that takes place in the European Union relates to the treaties themselves.  The treaties provide, among other things, for the internal market, which is based on the four freedoms.<\/p> <p>Over the years, a substantial jurisprudence has evolved at the Court of Justice, which has been based on the court striking down provisions which are effectively discriminatory between member states.  It is largely because many of these tax systems were built up at a time when the treaty considerations were not important or even relevant.  <\/p><p> On top of that, within the Union we have an exercise of what we call co-ordination which has been ongoing for a number of years.  In the Commission, we have been trying to encourage member states to take common positions on interpretation of EU law so that they apply similar provisions without necessarily having binding legislation.  It is a question of general co-operation.  This has a number of practical aspects that I will not go into at the moment. <\/p><p> As it is topical, I should mention that there is an issue about state aid concerning taxation as well.  The EU rules on state aid apply to taxation as they apply to other activities within the Union.<\/p><p> I want to mention two other things briefly.  One is the code of conduct on business taxation, which falls outside the sort of framework I have been talking about.  This entails EU member states meeting together in the Council to discuss tax competition and to examine individual tax regimes in member states to see if they fulfil the criteria already agreed between all member states and, on that basis, to remove those that are deemed to be harmful.  This is probably the most important policy discussion that takes place in the Union concerning the question of tax competition.  It has been ongoing for 12 or 13 years. <\/p><p> The final point concerning the framework is the European semester.  The European semester exercise concerns the co-ordination of macro-economic policies in the Union.  The Commission makes recommendations under this, some of which now concern taxation, but these tend to be broader in scope and are part of an overall attempt to help to rebalance the different economies.<\/p><p> In general, we do not make specific recommendations on detailed points under this, but it is good to know that it is there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014061100003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Kermode","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402492200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014061100004#C00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402492200,"counter":207,"content":"<p>If I could trespass on your good nature, Chairman, I will say a word about the action plan and what we are doing now.  There are two aspects I ought to mention.  One is the famous, or infamous, CCCTB or common consolidated corporate tax base.  That proposal was made by the Commission in 2011 and it remains on the Council table but has not been agreed as it stands.  This was the Commission's take on finding a solution to the complexities of taxation in the corporate field for corporate groups.  I am sure the joint sub-committee is familiar with the subject.<br\/>The second point I wish to mention is the action plan.  In 2012, the Commission adopted a so-called action plan to deal with tax fraud and evasion, but also to tackle issues of avoidance.  It did this because the heads of state and government asked the Commission to come forward with some concrete measures.  A list of measures was proposed and these varied quite considerably.  One of the more important things that came out of this was an indication in the action plan that member states needed to use the instruments they have better.  In addition, there needed to be greater co-operation using the existing instruments.  In some areas there was not a need to legislate, <i>per se, <\/i>but there was a need to co-operate more closely.  <br\/>The Commission made two recommendations at the time.  One was in relation to non-co-operative jurisdictions.  This was part of the wider EU policy that has been on the table since 2008 encouraging jurisdictions to apply so-called good governance.  Our good governance formula included exchange of information and transparency on harmful tax practices.  If we wanted to go out towards non-EU states, as the Council asked, we needed to promote these ideals with others.  Part of the underlying logic of this is to get the degree of co-operation required to avoid the need to put in place counter measures and aggressive strategies which have a negative effect on all types of business, whatever they might be.  <br\/>These two recommendations - the second of which was on aggressive tax planning - were adopted in 2012.  The Commission is in a process of discussion with the member states, NGOs and business organisations in a so-called platform of good governance, on the follow up to these and how they can improve the general situation.  If needs be, Chairman, we can talk about the detail of those.<br\/>I will now deal with the base erosion and profit shifting, or BEPS, exercise.  I understand that the joint sub-committee has had Mr. Pascal Saint-Amans of the OECD here to speak on the subject.  It is an ambitious project that the OECD has undertaken with a tight timetable.  There are a number of areas where this base erosion and profit shifting exercise impacts on issues of EU law.  The Commission has been following these matters closely.<br\/>It is worth mentioning a couple of issues, in particular, but the joint sub-committee may wish to deal with others later.  One is the whole question of harmful tax practices, to which I have already alluded.  There is more pressure in the base erosion profit shifting exercise to come up with agreements on what is, or is not, harmful.  It is clear that if the wider G20, OECD plus and other jurisdictions wish to come to agreements on changing the general rules on international taxation, there has to be some sort of accommodation on what is, or is not, acceptable tax competition.  That underlies the work the OECD is doing in this area, which is similar to the work going on with the EU's code of conduct.  That has helped to defuse some of the tension in the area of international taxation.<br\/>The other question concerns hybrid loans and hybrid entities - essentially mismatches between tax systems.  This is something we discussed with the member states in the code of conduct group from the viewpoint, at the beginning, of trying to decide if they were harmful tax practices according to the criteria that the code group itself uses.  That essentially defines a harmful tax practice as a form of predatory, ring-fenced regime which offers a lower tax rate than the general tax rate in a given member state.  <br\/>This exercise of looking at the hybrids started from the viewpoint of trying to define whether they were harmful.  One of the most important conclusions of the group - and it is an indication of the sort of thinking we like to see - was that it is not anybody's fault in particular in this case.  One cannot tie it down to one or other of these jurisdictions, but we all agreed that it has harmful effects so we should do something about it.  The upshot of that was an agreement in the group about how all member states would apply the same solution to tackling it.  It was fairly clear from a short examination of the problem that it not only concerned two member states together, but that it could also have effects on a third.<br\/>They agreed on the way to do it and then the question was how to implement it.  This has now come forward in a change to the existing EU parent-subsidiary directive whereby we are now close to an agreement between all member states about how to close this particular loophole.  This helps to give a bit of impetus in general to the solutions concerning mismatches, not only within the EU but also outside it.<br\/>I would also like to mention the so-called digital economy.  The Chairman may be aware that the Commission has asked an expert group to look into the taxation of the digital economy.  A report has been produced which we see as being a useful input, not only into discussions within the Union but also in wider discussions in the OECD.  That is something we can touch on if members of the joint sub-committee have questions about it.  For the moment, the Commission has not given a formal view as to what actions it would take on the basis of that, but there are a number of encouraging signals for us in it.<\/p> <p> Another issue that comes from the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, discussion is treaty abuse.  A substantial discussion is happening about the extent to which double tax treaties can be manipulated to cause so-called abuse.  This has considerable implications under EU law, partly for the reasons I set out earlier, namely, that the jurisprudence of the court takes a very dim view of a discrimination practice between member states, and many anti-abuse laws can be construed in a way to cause discrimination.  This discussion will have an impact in the EU, probably later in the year, again, under the parent-subsidiary directive and the interest and royalties directive, which are existing pieces of community law, as member states attempt to square the circle of providing effective anti-abuse measures that do not conflict with EU law or create situations that make life even more complicated for businesses.  Over the years the Commission has made various proposals, legislative and non-legislative, in the area of corporate tax, and our starting point has invariably been the interest of the internal market and ensuring businesses can do business and not just fill in forms.  That was the underlying logic behind, for example, the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB.<\/p><p> We are entering a very important period, given the progress being made on the BEPS project.  Between now and the end of 2015, jurisdictions and the EU will have to take a decision as to whether they want to take further action and how.  While there are very many different options, even in the OECD there is a discussion of multilateral solutions, and I suspect there will be a relatively complicated geometry to try to ensure some of the results of the BEPS exercise can be applied on the ground.  One of the most important general conclusions of our expert group on the digital economy was the need for member states to try to speak with one voice on some of these matters and lever their political and economic power to act together on taxation as they do in other areas.  This depends very largely on an acceptance of what is acceptable tax competition and what is not, and an acceptance that in some cases there are arguments for greater simplification of rules, which may have effects in one way or another but which would be justified if we can promote trade and business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014061100004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Kermode","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402492800,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I have been a tax partner with KPMG for the past ten years and have more than 20 years' experience in international tax matters.  As head of insurance in KPMG Ireland I have particular experience in that area, but my clients spread over many companies, areas and countries.  I was recently elected vice president of Chartered Accountants Ireland, where I chaired the tax committee for a number of years.  The work of this committee is very important regarding informing the Oireachtas on the current debate on international taxation and how it affects Ireland and I thank the members for that.  I will first talk about the global tax framework as it stands and how it is developing, and then discuss some areas of concern from an Irish point of view that are worthy of consideration here.<\/p><p>  The global tax framework grew up piecemeal over time.  There were national policies and there were responses to national imperatives from time to time.  There are three classes of countries.  First, there are the large countries which were focused on encouraging the outward expansion of their domestic businesses, such as the US in particular, whose tax policies are based very much on that.  Second, there are the intermediate countries, which could be called conduit countries, small islands dependent on those large countries and used by them to facilitate international trade.  Third, there is the class of countries with the simple imperative of attracting international business investment and international trade and providing for jobs locally.  Despite any commentary to the contrary, Ireland is very definitely in the third category of countries.<\/p><p>  Ireland has many international companies employing hundreds of thousands of people directly and indirectly across the economy, with real substance.  It is clear that the global tax framework needs reform and investigation, and that leaves open whether such reform should be of a revolutionary or evolutionary nature, and this may be a question of time.  From a business perspective it should be evolutionary, and that is along the lines of many of the BEPS proposals, including dealing with perceived hybrid and treaty abuses and considering the appropriateness of current transfer pricing standards.  This is because a degree of certainty must be maintained for businesses.  We know from experience that constant changes to a framework or rules that are difficult to interpret or get one's head around add to an environment which degrades entrepreneurship, discourages business and, ultimately, reduces tax revenue.  Uncertainty in tax law results in businesses declining to make commercial decisions and this retards growth, and I have seen this in numerous countries.<\/p><p>  This committee has already examined the global framework in place and how it is largely driven by bilateral treaties, the OECD at global level and the EU here in Ireland.  The G20 has only recently become a driver in the BEPS project, which has much to recommend it.  It is a genuine attempt to put order on the tax systems of the world and how they interact with each other and deal with mismatches in the laws.  If BEPS is to succeed, and we all have a part to play in this, it is important it does not become a vehicle for protectionism and national self interest, which is a fear.<\/p><p>  While EU countries are subject to all the controls, if we rely on the four freedoms and state aid within the EU we run the risk of creating a fortress Europe, and while it is important to encourage internal trade, external trade is also important and we do not want to strangle it.  Fair tax completion in this context is universally accepted, and has been endorsed by the EU Commission.  In Ireland's case it is encapsulated in the 12.5% corporation tax rate.  This has been very important and has helped offset the natural pull of the centre for economic development and has been a model for peripheral development of which we should be proud.<\/p><p>  Some of the BEPS proposals would hinder peripheral development and international trade.  I will refer to four examples of this.  The economies of most countries are by now interconnected and rely on foreign as well as domestic capital.  Foreign ownership operates side by side with domestic ownership, and is a mark of economic freedom.  However, the limitation proposals on double tax treaties being discussed in the BEPS proposals almost exclusively favour domestic ownership over international ownership.  If we were to follow that line, particularly for small countries such as Ireland-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014061100005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1402492800,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I must interrupt.

If that were to happen, it would limit the access of businesses not completely owned within Ireland to international capital and markets, and that would be a dangerous move.<\/p> <p>Similarly, there are some best proposals dealing with company residency.  In order to deal with some of those issues, one of the proposals is that it be dealt with by mutual agreement.  I have dealt with mutual agreement and in my experience mutual agreement with states is a very lengthy process.  Outcomes tend to be subject to the vagaries of what happens at the time and are uncertain.  That does not help from a business expansion perspective.<\/p><p> We all agree that transparency is important in the tax process.  The country by country reporting module is helpful from a tax authority point of view.  It is important when we get to exchange of information on a country by country report to remember how sophisticated data protection rules on that are in Ireland.  If we are going to share data and information with all countries in the world, it is important that the same standards apply wherever we are sharing that data.  Also the extent of the mandatory reporting needs to be within the ability of businesses and Revenue authorities to deal with it. <\/p><p> The standardisation of transfer pricing documentation is welcome.  It is important that it be standardised rather than set at a minimum in order that companies can deal on an even basis across the world.  There is a huge opportunity here to cut down on administration but if there is simply a minimum standard, what happens is that countries add to it bit by bit and it loses its effectiveness both for business and the taxing authorities because it leads to a situation where one has unequal information.<\/p><p> Mr. Philip Kermode mentioned work on hybrid mismatches.  That is always an awkward issue.  It is a mismatch where a company or a transaction is treated differently in one country versus another.  That is the case because of the way the system grew up piecemeal.  Work on that issue is long over due.  One of the proposals about which we need to be careful is the imposition on businesses to look in non-controlled circumstances as to what is the treatment on the other side, rather than in control situations.  Overall, it is a worthy project to modernise the global tax framework and I hope it succeeds.<\/p><p> As Ireland is home to a large number of substantive international businesses which at the end of the day employ, directly and indirectly, hundreds of thousands of people, it is clear that the Irish tax system places a premium on substance in Ireland and as such Ireland has much gain from the modernisation of the system.  Clearly, we need to look on the other side to what works best.  What happens here has to be revolutionary and represent a consensus between all countries.  We must take care to ensure the process is not hijacked by national or sectional interests and that the final proposals are practical and easy to implement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014061100005#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402493400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lynch.

Of particular importance, this is recognised also in Paris where the OECD meets, is the need to ensure that the solutions arrived at are solutions that can actually be applied by EU member states.  There is a risk in starting from a blank slate that proposals are made that are simply incompatible with the treaty requirements of the EU, in which case our member states will not be able to apply them.  This is something we try to avoid.

Therein, one sees a large part of the problem, that what is aggressive tax planning in one jurisdiction may not necessarily be considered for the moment as being in the other and it requires a sea-change in the way people think of international taxation, away from the idea of a simple bilateral bargaining situation to a more multilateral approach which means people have common standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014061100006#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Kermode"},{"type":"speech","time":1402493400,"counter":219,"content":"<p>As I understand the process, it is not meant to lead to complete harmonisation of the tax code in every country but it is to put some sort of order in it.

Everyone is aware of the issues of the so-called &ldquo;check the box&rdquo; and the problems driven in part by that.  There is so much political capital tied up, particularly at G20 level, in this exercise that something will have to happen.  The risk is that it is something that is too complicated.  It is not about just trying to get the OECD countries on board but the other G20 countries and big players, such as the BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China, some of which have had little influence in designing international tax rules.  It is far from a straightforward issue.  For example, the discussions on the treaty abuse issues seem to be centring on the idea of having several measures together.  The Americans have an interest in the limitation of benefits type clauses which restrict very much the benefits of a tax treaty.  There are others who prefer a main purpose test.  If this is an approach replicated throughout the BEPS project, there is a risk that one is adding to the protective measures without dealing with the problems at their base.

This is essentially how the standards are put together, although there are variations in how they are implemented.  Some countries veer more away from the OECD's standards than towards them.<\/p><p>  Within the transfer pricing regime, the one element that tends to differ substantially between countries is the amount of information and documentation that a particular tax authority might want on a particular transaction.  The same transaction might result in different documentation being prepared in one country versus in another country.  This leads to a degree of complexity on the one hand but, on the other, a degree of additional administration and cost for businesses.  As such and if feasible, the base erosion and profit sharing, BEPS, project presents an opportunity to devise a regime that is more standardised across the world where the information is available.  The standard would be set rather than be a minimum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014061100009#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1402495200,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lynch.

In many instances, it is not easy to find a comparable transaction to the one being examined between related parties.  This poses a difficulty.  The concept is relatively straightforward.  What the tax administrations or, at least, the transfer pricing rules are seeking to do is create a so-called arm's length relationship between group company members that would be similar to that between two third parties carrying out a business.  By the nature of large groups, complex transactions are conducted, some of which may not make sense in a normal environment between third parties.  Putting a value on them is a difficult task.<\/p><p>  For this reason, the idea of a formal apportionment was proposed as part of the discussions on a common tax base that the Commission tabled.  The intent was to cut through all of the attempts at creating artificial distinctions and find a formula that people could accept.  We are discussing the allocation of profit between different jurisdictions in a situation that, by its nature, is somewhat different from a third party-to-third party transaction.<\/p><p>  The Union's arbitration convention has existed for many years and has attempted to provide some form of arbitration in the case of transfer pricing disputes.  Perhaps this aspect has not been touched on at this meeting in the context of BEPS.  Dispute resolution would be an important aspect, particularly if the new rules turned out to be relatively complex.  There will have to be some system that ensures, for example, that companies do not end up paying for a situation in which tax administrations are at loggerheads.  This situation can arise.  Anything that moves the issue in the direction of simplification has to be good.  We in the Commission are still pondering how to pursue this idea of arbitration in a way that would be well balanced between the interests of business and administrations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014061100009#H01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Kermode"},{"type":"speech","time":1402495200,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Is the concept of arbitration currently in practice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014061100009#H01200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402495200,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Yes.

There are, of course, cases where individual jurisdictions would contend what other jurisdictions would say.  I do not believe that thus in itself totally invalidates all transfer pricing.

Within the BEPS process and in the context of action on treaty abuses one of the questions raised was whether a limitation on benefits clause should be inserted into the treaty.  Whether a company qualifies to access the treaty would be dependent on where the company is owned.  For example, if a company were entirely or more than 50% owned within the signatory state it would qualify for treaty benefits.  That is the basic premise of this.  In the US, this type of limitation on benefits clause, with a number of exclusions, applies.  To make it work, the clause in terms of provisions runs to many pages in the Ireland-US treaty.  It can work for very large economies from that perspective.  The fear is that if, when dealing with a small economy like Ireland, one applies this across the board because many Irish operations are owned outside of Ireland - even small operations would have foreign capital coming in - if they want to trade internationally and cannot access the treaty because of their ownership they are at a disadvantage to companies of larger countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014061100010#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1402495800,"counter":281,"content":"<p>The same would apply in all small countries and not only Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014061100010#J00700","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402495800,"counter":282,"content":"<p>It becomes a bigger issue the smaller the country and internal capital sources and so on.

However, as I said earlier, the underlying feature of BEPS is that there is a recognition that multinationals can use intellectual property and royalty payments to shift profits between jurisdictions in a way that would be seen by many as being artificial.  One of the key points of the BEPS exercise is to try to deal with the so-called transfer pricing aspects of this and to put prices on the intellectual property transfers and on the dealings between these different elements of corporate groups so they reflect a business reality.

Some of it might be driven by issues which are being looked at as part of the BEPS process but in my experience, and I would have been involved in these as well, some of it may also be driven by other countries applying their own transfer pricing rules and saying that a company should be charging its Irish company for the IP that is owned here as well.  Quite an amount of this, and I do not know to what extent, may also be even transfers for IP within the EU which is being charged for and which is actually being subjected to quite robust transfer pricing in countries at present.

It was reported recently that in 2012 Google had revenues of &euro;15.5 billion from its Irish operation, but it paid only &euro;17 million in tax.  That is an infinitesimal amount of tax.  The reason it succeeded in paying so little tax is that it charged &euro;11 billion of the &euro;15 billion in administrative expenses to another one of its subsidiaries that was not tax liable here.  That is quite extraordinary.  It tallies with something somebody whom one might call a whistleblower who previously worked for one of these companies told me, that the amount these companies charged to administrative expenses, royalties, patents or whatever happened to be close to what they made in profits.  It was blatant abuse of transfer pricing.<\/p><p>  The point is that it appears to be self evident that Ireland is facilitating this practice to a far greater degree than anywhere else, which is why there is such an uproar about Ireland's position.  One can compare the effective tax rate that the example I mentioned would give, which is approximately 2%, with the rates of other countries in Europe.  In the UK the rate is 18.5% - these are not nominal rates, but effective rates - in Germany it is 20% and in France it is 35%.  Some of these figures are disputed, but they are all considerably higher than the effective rate that the example I have given implies.  Is it not self evident and obvious that whatever way we are applying the rules or directives on transfer pricing we are facilitating this tax avoidance to a far greater extent?  In fact, it is not just tax avoidance but tax evasion.  If one is abusing transfer pricing to this extent, it is tax evasion.  We are facilitating that to a far greater extent than any other European state.

I do not see how one can talk about a fair regime in what is a predatory practice by definition.  Surely once there is competition in this area inevitably people will try to get around the rules, bend them which is followed by a race to the bottom in terms of the contribution that corporations are likely to pay.  Historically, the pattern has spanned the period from the 1970s to now.  Is it not self-evident that the tax contribution by corporations and companies has fallen steadily since the 1970s leading to the sort of incredible situations that we have now with huge profits being avoided or evaded?

It is a model for the way the periphery and the centre can interact without imposing a single rate or a centralised regime for everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014061100014#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1402498200,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I have a question for Mr. Kermode.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014061100014#N00500","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1402498200,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I have question for Mr. Lynch that stems from his paper about the boardroom and tax planning.

Everyone will have seen on television recently what has happened there as well as read about it in the newspapers.  Today, we will meet representatives of GOAL, Concern and Oxfam to discuss South Sudan.  South Sudan gained its independence from Sudan three years ago and while it is Africa's newest country, it is also, unfortunately, one of the continent's poorest countries.  A combination of the consequences of years of armed conflict along with unfavourable and sometimes unseasonable weather conditions have led to a situation where there are huge humanitarian needs in that country.  <\/p><p>  Irish Aid has contributed &euro;5 million to date in 2014 to South Sudan to support the work of the United Nations and the NGOs in the region.  However, the need remains great.  One of the most pressing needs in South Sudan currently is that humanitarian access is granted to all civilians, especially those displaced as a result of the ongoing conflict.  At the beginning of June, the number of people reported to be displaced was a shocking 1.4 million, which is a huge number.<\/p><p>  I am delighted to welcome three organisations, namely, Oxfam, GOAL and Concern, which have workers on the ground in South Sudan.  The format of the meeting is that we will hear a brief presentation from each of the organisations followed by a questions and answers session.  I call Mr. Jim Clerkin, who is very familiar to members and is the chief executive officer of Oxfam.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014061100002#A00400","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402493400,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Good afternoon Chairman and members.  On behalf of Oxfam, the other organisations represented here and the people in South Sudan affected by the conflict and the looming food crisis, I thank the committee for taking the time to raise this as an important issue in the busy schedule of items it is called on to discuss.<\/p><p>  The history of South Sudan, as a nation, is short but its rich history with all its diversity is one which has endured far too much time in the ravages of war, hunger and misery.  Today, it is at a bit of tipping point.  I refer to the realisation of hope and opportunity which comes about through independence and this widening division within the country and the impact it is having in terms of a humanitarian crisis.  I lived and worked in South Sudan and witnessed at first hand the excitement, optimism and the extraordinary energy around independence.  I witnessed the first group of refugees returning after the civil war which lasted 20 years.  Some of the people had not even been born in South Sudan but their sense of optimism about building this new country was palpable.  We need to focus on how we get it back on that track because clearly what has happened recently has knocked it off that.<\/p> <p>It is the newest country in the world, celebrating its third birthday on 9 July but it is also one of the poorest.  In the normal run of things, food crises can be cyclical and can recur time and again.  However, what we are seeing now has been exacerbated because of the fall out from hostilities and is putting the fledgling country on the brink of catastrophe.  Approximately 10,000 people have been killed directly in the conflict, with more than 1.3 million displaced.  Over 300,000 refugees have fled to surrounding states and 4 million people are in need of humanitarian aid - food, shelter, water, sanitation and medical assistance.  They are also, critically, in need of protection so that they can live a life free from actual or threat of harm.  It is important to state that the issues facing South Sudan are not specific to that country but have huge regional ramifications and we need to see a regional response.  We attempted to raise this issue before with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and others in early January.  Since then, the situation has continued to get worse.  <\/p><p> In the summer of 2011 we all saw the devastating impact of the famine that ripped through the Horn of Africa.  Following this catastrophic event, Oxfam and others carried out a study and produced a report called The Deadly Delay, which was extremely critical of the international community - including ourselves - in terms of the lateness of the response.  As a direct result of that and of the world being far more proactive in 2012, it is fair to say that we avoided a repeat in the Sahel region of western and central Africa.  It is not impossible to stop these things from happening.  We need to ensure that the word famine is consigned to history.  It is within our ability and it is our duty to prevent this level of human suffering.  The Deadly Delay report deals with the issue of changing the trajectory of human suffering but also argues that clever investment to prevent these events from happening is actually cost-effective.  It means that countries are in a much better situation following a crisis which does not become a catastrophe.  We believe this crisis can be prevented from escalating into absolute catastrophe if there is sufficient will and action now.  <\/p><p> Opportunities are opening up now, not least the commencement of the rainy season which is critical to agricultural production and the additional &euro;600 million pledged by donors in Oslo recently.  Further to the comments of the Chairman, I welcome the support of the Irish Government, through Irish Aid, for humanitarian actors such as Oxfam, GOAL and Concern and acknowledge the additional funding pledged in Oslo.  There has also been a revision of the UN mission in South Sudan, with increased emphasis on the protection of civilians.  Last night it was announced that Salva Kiir and Riek Machar signed an agreement in Addis Ababa that commits to forming a transitional government within 60 days.  Signing an agreement is one thing but delivering on it is another matter.  The Intergovernmental Authority on Development, IGAD, the regional body overseeing this process, needs to ensure that they live up to their commitments.  These are all opportunities but they will amount to nothing if they are not matched by actions which lead to real change on the ground for those affected by the conflict including: the translation of the current cessation of hostilities into a permanent ceasefire; a process of reconciliation and inclusive political dialogue which goes beyond just the warring factions to include all of the people of South Sudan, which is cognisant of the rights of the whole population; respect for the protection of humanitarian personnel and assets and unhindered humanitarian access to those affected; and sustained diplomatic efforts in support of peace talks.  Members have been furnished with a copy of letter which Oxfam encouraged a number of eminent African leaders to sign, including the former presidents of a number of the countries in the region as well as our old friend, Archbishop Tutu, encouraging those involved to live up to their commitments.<\/p><p> We need to see a collective condemnation of violence by the international community and that needs to be sustained every time we hear of violent acts.  Efforts are also needed to tackle the underlying drivers of violence, including the proliferation of arms.  We need a timely and sustained release of humanitarian funding.  Such funding must be dispersed across all sectors and increased for protection activities, the sector which currently receives the lowest level of funding from the international community.  It is fine to have commitments but we need to see them delivered upon urgently and in a sustained fashion.  We also need to see rapid mobilisation of the resources for UNMISS, including finances, equipment and personnel.  There have been some welcome commitments made in the context of UNMISS concerning the change of mandate, the scaling up of personnel and so forth but we need to see them actually being delivered.  Personnel must be fully trained and sensitive to the effects of the conflict on the civilian population, particularly the women.  <\/p><p> The people who are displaced will simply not return home if it is not safe to do so.  We need to put pressure on to create the environment to enable them to return and to enable the existing population to resume their normal lives.  A massive surge in the humanitarian response by agencies on the ground is needed now before seasonal rains make many areas of the country inaccessible.  There is no room for delay on this.  A window of opportunity exists but we need to generate momentum.  The issue of South Sudan keeps falling off the radar but has the potential to be the biggest humanitarian crisis in the world in a very short period of time unless we act now.  We have learned a lot of lessons from the past and can use those lessons but we need a concerted effort.  I urge this committee to ensure that Ireland uses its influence in the most positive way possible.  It must work with the international community to make sure that those who are party to this live up to their commitments in order to prevent this crisis from turning into a catastrophe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014061100002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Clerkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402493400,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Clarken and also thank Mr. Colm Byrne, the humanitarian manager of Oxfam for being with us today.

Fighting broke out in South Sudan back in December 2013.  Since the second peace agreement was signed on 9 May 2014 continued fighting across South Sudan has been the norm.  I agree with my colleague from Oxfam that it is heartening to hear about the agreement that was signed in Addis Ababa yesterday and the positive rhetoric from both leaders in terms of a commitment to form a transitional government of national unity in 60 days.  However, there is some degree of scepticism about this and political will is required to ensure that it happens.<\/p><p>  In just under five months since the conflict began the situation has deteriorated considerably resulting in 1.3 million people fleeing from their homes with an estimated 300,000 migrating as refugees to neighbouring countries.  Humanitarian actors have warned that by the end of this year half of all South Sudanese citizens could experience forced displacement within the country or as external refugees.  According to the United Nations, South Sudan is likely to face the worst famine since the Ethiopia famine of 1984-85, with potentially up to 4 million people affected, of whom 2.5 million are children.  UNICEF is predicting that 50,000 children under the age of five are likely to die this year alone.  <\/p><p>  GOAL has been operational in South Sudan since 1998 and our first priority throughout this crisis has been to continue to support the 500,000 people who are currently dependent on us for primary health care, nutrition, clean water, immunisation and their basic livelihoods.  All of GOAL&rsquo;s areas of operations continue to be affected by the conflict, which is largely taking place in three of the ten states of South Sudan.  One of the most affected is the Upper Nile State which continues to see active fighting.<\/p> <p> GOAL provides health, nutrition and sanitation services to displaced people from Balliet and Ulang counties which have become divided since this post-December conflict, with Balliet having been ransacked in January and a fault-line opening up along pro-Government and anti-Government lines along this county border.  The mostly Dinka population from Balliet fled, seeking sanctuary, first to Malakal which in turn was attacked several times.  GOAL has followed these people as they move to ensure we can continue to access health care facilities, as well as providing a nutrition and sanitation through mobile clinics.  We see the devastation these people face as every time they move the conflict follows.  It is putting major pressure on our humanitarian aid response to ensure we can keep up with the movement.<\/p><p> There have been almost 200,000 people displaced into the neighbouring country of Ethiopia.  Since March of this year GOAL has established a refugee response programme across the border in the Gambella region of Ethiopia where we have been delivering nutrition support to 15,000 of the most severely malnourished who have crossed into that country in search of assistance.  We are currently engaged in dialogue with Concern about working in collaboration to expand that programme and reach more people.<\/p><p> Refugees are currently arriving in the Gambella region at a daily rate of 1,200, which requires a new refugee camp holding 50,000 people to be opened every 42 days in Gambella.  This population is primarily made of up women and children with almost 70% of the population being aged less than 18 years of age.<\/p><p> GOAL is monitoring closely the escalating refugee problem across Ethiopia and several of South Sudan&rsquo;s neighbouring countries.  If famine strikes, as has been predicted, it is our opinion that the refugee crisis will become a catastrophe.  In Twic and Agok, we not only continue our programming in these challenging areas, but we have responded to displaced people from Unity State, where there is still active conflict.  GOAL is providing health and nutrition services for around 15,000 displaced people here, along with a water and sanitation programme.<\/p><p> Let me stress that while not all areas of South Sudan have experienced heavy fighting, the entire country is to one degree or another affected by this conflict, manifesting itself in a disruption to markets, a reduction in agricultural production and mass population migration.  This has led to extreme burdens on an already fragile basic infrastructure.  Before the conflict, South Sudan was in a fragile situation.  The pattern of displacement has encouraged a particular focus on those citizens who have sought refuge at the United Nations Mission in South Sudan, UNMISS compounds.  There are also a large number of people who are not compounds who are choosing to locate in smaller concentrations in rural locations, believing that is a safer option for them during the conflict.  This bring its own problems for the humanitarian response.  The combination of factors such as ongoing displacement of people, a poor cropping season, widespread market disruption, subsequent high food prices and resulting low income sources will in our opinion lead to what is being predicted as significant food insecurity and even famine <\/p><p> In addition, there have been multiple reports accusing government and non-government forces of targeting civilians based on their ethnicity.  A report in May by UNMISS stated that there are reasonable grounds to believe that violations of international human rights and humanitarian law have been committed by both parties to the conflict.  Those violations include enforced disappearances, rape and other acts of sexual violence, arbitrary arrests and detention, targeted attacks against civilians and attacks on hospitals and day centres.  Even prior to the current crisis logistical access in South Sudan for humanitarian staff and relief items was volatile due to limited transport infrastructure and annual rains and floods which make up to 60% of the country inaccessible by road, at the best of times.  <\/p><p> The level of humanitarian funding, as referenced by Oxfam, available for South Sudan, even post-Oslo, is insufficient when compared to the unmet needs on the ground.  The crisis response plan remains only 60% funded, and 40% unfunded.  We welcome the fact that in late May, the UN Security Council authorised a revised mandate for UNMISS, with a focus on protecting civilians; monitoring and investigating human rights; creating the conditions for delivery of humanitarian assistance; and supporting the implementation of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement ahead of state-building activities.  Funding is needed to be channelled to humanitarian activities.  The revised mandate emphasises that protection of civilians must be given priority in decisions about the use of available capacity and resources within the mission.  We in GOAL cannot stress that enough.  Notwithstanding that, more needs to be done.  Violence against civilians must stop, and the protection of civilians must be a priority.  A ceasefire agreement is only the first step in a longer-term peace process, requiring sustained commitment to addressing the deeper issues.  The latest crisis in South Sudan must be seen as part of a longer-term protracted crisis, with its roots heavily laid in unresolved ethnic rivalries, lack of accountable and responsive government and limited access to basic services and livelihood opportunities.<\/p><p> There is a need to remove all formal and inform barriers to access for humanitarian staff, relief items and resources, including expansion of cross border access to enable NGOs bring relief items in from Sudan and Ethiopia.  Finally, funding of the South Sudan humanitarian crisis despite pledging conferences is lower than anticipated and this must be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014061100003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jonathan Edgar","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402494000,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Edgar for his contribution.

I have worked on and off for many years in South Sudan but I have also worked in North Sudan, so that has given me a different perspective of how the country was shaping up.  <\/p><p>  Like Mr. Clarken I remember when the peace deal was signed and the level of optimism when the new Sudan, emerging out of years of conflict, was formed and would take its place among the nations of the world.  It had the benefit of significant oil revenues and there was a hope it could fund its own development.<\/p><p>  As a result of the suffering during the war years, there were significant gaps in the provision of education.  The emerging leaders had no great educational attainment and no experience of governance.  There was the expectation that with limited support South Sudan would become a nation and take its place in the world.  In the subsequent years the SPLA and the various other rebel forces became part of the army and were paid.  There was no merging of the forces within the army so they continued to operate separately as opposed to a single unit that was there to serve and defend the new nation.  That approach has been reflected throughout the way the country developed in the past three years.  It was almost inevitable that it would break down in conflict.  It was more a matter of when rather than if it would happen.  The sad part is that there was a great opportunity for support for nation building through the three years of that evolution.  That opportunity for nation building was clearly missed and not taken on board.  <\/p><p>  Oil has been both a blessing and a curse in so many different parts of Africa.  In South Sudan, it has caused more pain and suffering than it has benefited the people.  The oil reserves have been a source of controversy between the north and south.  The taps were turned off a couple of years ago and the issue of paying soldiers and ensuring that the government had revenue to operate.  All of the factors fed into what happened in mid December 2013.  Conflict broke out.  <\/p><p>  We have been working in South Sudan for years.  Concern staff remained in Juba over Christmas when many other humanitarian agencies evacuated their staff.  Concern put in extra staff to deal with the influx of refugees and displaced people into Juba.<\/p> <p>They needed care and maintenance and we stayed to provide them.  We also continued our operations in Bentiu, which has proved extremely difficult as a location for Concern.  We have a team on the ground, which stays in the UNMISS compound with staff from several other non-governmental organisations.  When the area comes under attack staff move into a bunker where they remain until the attacks ease off.  They then come out to try to lend assistance before returning to the bunker for another period.  Ceasefire agreements come and go.  It is great, therefore, that a new agreement was signed yesterday.  We are all waiting with bated breath on what will emerge and whether the agreement will mark the beginning of the end of the conflict.<\/p><p> Many of the underlying causes of the conflict persist.  We see a level of aggression among some of the South Sudanese on both sides that we have not encountered previously.  Our staff have come under attack.  The other day, for instance, we had to send a member of staff working in a distribution centre to receive stitches caused by aggression.  Much of this can be attributed to years of conflict and the struggle that people have in relating to other human beings on a one-to-one basis.  <\/p><p> As Mr. Edgar and Mr. Clarken stated, this is a long and protracted emergency.  We are very worried about food security in the region.  I worked in Khartoum in 1989 and 1990 when hundreds of thousands of famine-ravished people moved from south Sudan into the north.  Is such a scenario coming down the line again?  The conflict is preventing access to many of the planting areas.  If the seed is not planted now and a ceasefire is not in place to enable planting to take place, there will definitely be a famine.  South Sudan was starting at a low base and experienced very high malnutrition rates last year and the year before when normal circumstances prevailed.  The war has completely interrupted the transfer and distribution of goods and disrupted market access. <\/p><p> I do not want to appear before this committee or speak at another forum in six or 12 months in the midst of one of the most dreadful famines that one could imagine.  Such a scenario is not beyond the bounds of possibility, however.  While we are doing a great deal of work to try to pre-position goods, security does not allow us to do so to the extent we would like.  Access is also a significant issue.  In addition, the rains are coming and have already arrived in many places.  Concern is intensely worried that the circumstances will worsen and the funding position will not enable us to mount the level of response we would like.  We are also intensely worried that access to the vulnerable populations we would like to visit on a much more regular and supportive basis will not be open to us.  <\/p><p> To return to the contributions of Mr. Edgar and Mr. Clarken, Ireland is in a strong position to raise the voice of Sudan in the various forums in which we enjoy such a high reputation.  As representatives of non-governmental organisations, we must examine how we can raise Ireland's voice. <\/p><p> Effective and lasting peace is a prerequisite for progress and will only be achieved if there is a demand and pressure from all sides to try to have a peace accord signed and subsequently operated, monitored and rolled out, with people held to account when it is not realised to the extent promised.  We also want to achieve humanitarian access.  We need to access the most vulnerable populations.  The reconciliation talks need to address the gross human rights abuses that have taken place by all sides in the conflict.  There must also be a commitment to nation building.  Even if a peace deal were signed in the morning, we would still be faced with the same problems and underlying causes of the conflict.  Concerted efforts at nation building are needed.  <\/p><p> All of us have referred to food security and the potential for famine.  Debate on this issue must be raised to a new level in areas in which members are active and can use their voices for South Sudan.  The idea of a famine is horrific.  Having worked through many famines, I certainly do not want a similar scenario to emerge.  We must work together to prevent such an eventuality.<\/p><p> Timely and effective disbursement of humanitarian funds is important.  One of the big issues we face at the moment is that while much of the humanitarian funding for South Sudan was intended for a wide area, as Mr. Edgar indicated, not all areas are affected by conflict and some are still at peace.  Concern works in Aweil West, which has been unaffected by the conflict thus far.  The funding that was committed to Aweil West has been transferred to fund a humanitarian response in some of the areas where conflict is taking place.  We are dealing with high levels of malnutrition in Aweil West as part of normal practice.  As a result, if the funding destined for this area is reallocated, we will not be able to deal with the malnutrition we are seeing daily.  In addition, the transfer of this funding will fuel the conflict because the people affected will feel excluded, disenfranchised and angry.  The conflict could spread if funding is not returned to the areas from which it is being transferred.  <\/p><p> Ireland has a strong voice, which is well respected in many of the forums in which members are active.  As such, members could speak a great deal, change the direction and bring Sudan up a notch in terms of perception and visibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014061100004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402494600,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I thank our three witnesses for their graphic account of what is taking place in south Sudan and what can and should be done.

The loss of life and displacement of persons has been huge and it is necessary to provide people with protection, food, water, nutrition and shelter.

On the issue of aid, can we be reassured that those for whom the aid is intended goes directly to them with the minimum of interference or disruption and that is reinforced from the point of view of raising aid in donor countries?  It is most important that is emphasised.  What is the most effective way of using all possible areas of influence to try to bring about an interruption of the violence and recognition of an attempt being made to avert a famine in the future?  Is it the threat of an international war crimes tribunal, for example, in the case of Mr. Taylor in an adjoining jurisdiction?  What is the possibility of arresting the downward progress in its tracks because that appears to be an ongoing issue, in one location this year, in another location next year and in another location elsewhere.  Nobody appears to have any respect for the international community or the international community itself has not exerted its influence in a way that is sufficiently convincing.  The reason for that is that there are no consequences for perpetrators of that nature    Notwithstanding the fact that there may well be historical reasons for wars and internal wars, the obvious way to bring issues to a conclusion is by way of negotiation or peaceful means.  When will that happen and what is the best way to tackle it?  I know I am asking a question that has been asked of the witnesses many times previously but I am looking forward to their response.  I have long held the view that the international community does not exert its influence.  It does not have any authority in many of the regions and because it has no authority there is no respect for it.  Ultimately, there will be no respect, effectively, for what donor countries are doing.  They are actually feeding the starving population in a country that is ravaged by war which is an indirect reassurance, so to speak, that the fighting men can continue to fight on and wreak on all kinds of destruction on the community and then the international community will try to help feed the people in the absence of anything else.  I do not know the answer but from an international point of view we need to come to some conclusions in that area and the sooner the better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014061100006#E00500","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1402495200,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Eric Byrne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014061100006#E00600","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1402495200,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  This is not the image of Africa we wanted or thought we were achieving.  We pride ourselves in recognising the economic growth in certain countries in Africa and the development and maturity of Africa as a continent.  The witnesses expose to us again the horrors and somebody used a comparison with the Ethiopian famine.  The irony of that is that Ethiopia is on the doorstep.  While it might beg all kinds of interesting questions about why it has come to this, Sudan has suffered an unmerciful many years of conflict.  The witnesses have obviously witnessed the joy of the South Sudanese people getting their independence after a vicious war with their friends in Sudan.  South Sudan has been admitted to the United Nations as a full member and now they divide and tear each other apart, so it is another human tragedy.<br\/>May I ask a few direct questions as I am not familiar with the area.  South Sudan is broken from North Sudan in that Sudan comprises the north while South Sudan is in the south, the oil is somewhere in the middle and there is much border conflict between north and south.  What does Sudan think of the conflict in South Sudan?  Does it aid, abet, assist or open corridors?  They were one people at one stage.  My second question is one we do not like to raise, that of tribalism, a conflict between two former fighters for South Sudan's independence.  Since they have divided it would appear they are divided on ethnic grounds.  If they have divided on ethnic grounds what is the composition of the ethnicity between the Dinkas and the others?  Is the ratio 50:50, is it religious or cultural or what are the differences between them that make fight such a vicious war?  The reports from the region are disturbing.  Ms Anne O'Mahony mentioned the viciousness and the brutality and how it is affecting workers on the ground., and the range of brutalities in which they are engaged.The brutality involves not only killing, raping but recruiting young child soldiers, all of which are very disturbing.  <br\/>If anybody was looking in here, they would see many white people from Ireland speaking about aid again to Africa.  Yes, we are going to provide humanitarian aid but on the political front, Africa is a mature continent.  Who is carrying the burden of political responsibility for these outrages in South Sudan <i>vis-&agrave;-vis  <\/i>the African Union?  I understand the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, IGAD, is probably the African Union's tool.  So far as we can, we will provide humanitarian aid but the who carries the political consequences?  In fairness, it would seem to me that the Ethiopians are playing a rather progressive role so far as they brought the two leaders together who had not spoken since the war broke out.  They have signed a new agreement but whether it will be lived up remains to be seen.  The tragedy would be - the Ethiopians know this only too well - that what Ethiopia suffered and to which Irish people responded to an incredible degree in the support it gave to the Ethiopian famine, could ironically be replicated across the border from Ethiopia.  The witnesses have all our support.  We will raise the issue at all possible levels, with the T&aacute;naiste, MEPs and in the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014061100006#E00700","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1402495200,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014061100006#E00800","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1402495200,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and note the amazing work being done by their staff and those on the ground in South Sudan and in other areas.<\/p> <p>As has been stated before, those who work for the organisations represented here are great ambassadors for Ireland.

Are our guests of the view that the peace talks will have an impact?  Is there any guarantee that matters are going to settle down?  The conflict appears to be bubbling over and people have referred to the dangers of ethnic violence erupting.  What is the position with regard to internally displaced persons, IDPs?  Are most of them being housed in camps mainly in the vicinity of Juba or are they spread throughout the country?  Are many of those who fled the fighting staying with distant relatives?  Our guests referred to the number of people who have fled to other countries, such as Ethiopia, and the impact this has had.  The countries in question have their own difficulties and experienced famines in the past.  On last night's edition of \"Newsnight\", reference was made to the emergence of rape and sexual violence in the conflict.  It was stated that the use of rape and sexual violence had been a relatively unknown phenomenon during the war but that it is becoming increasingly common.  What resources - for example, those relating to counselling, etc. - are our guests' organisations in a position to put in place in order to offer support to those affected?<\/p><p> The entire region is awash with weapons.  Are there any programmes in place to try to buy back some of these weapons or to take them out of combatants hands in some other way?  Such programmes have been successful in other regions.  Is it just the case that there are too many weapons in South Sudan?  All of our hopes are focused on the new agreement and I would welcome it if our guests were in a position to provide any further information in respect of it.<\/p><p> Reference was made to attacks on staff.  It is probably not unusual that difficulties occur when people who are hungry are seeking food at aid stations.  However, our guests have seen fit to mention this development so I am obliged to ask whether it is a new factor.  What can be done in the context of providing security for staff at aid stations?<\/p><p> I wish our guests well.  If the situation with regard to security is not resolved, then there is a possibility that a famine could develop.  If people cannot grow their own food, then conditions are only going to get worse.  Reference was made to areas where conflict has not broken out but into which the organisations represented here have been obliged to deploy resources.  If additional resources can be sent to those areas, then perhaps the amount of food available in the region might increase.  I am of the view that this is one of the goals we should be seeking to achieve in the long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014061100006#E00900","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402495800,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives from the three organisations and I compliment them on the amazing work they are doing in such difficult circumstances.

Are they confident that the current peace talks will be brought to a successful conclusion?  What is the level of international involvement in the context of trying to assist in brokering peace and restoring some level of stability to the region?<\/p><p>  Ms O'Mahony stated that planting crops is not going to be possible.  What sort of window of opportunity exists in the context of ensuring that they will be planted?  In other words, how quickly must stability be restored in order that planting might proceed on time?  What will be the difference in terms of the amount of aid that will be required if planting takes place and if it does not?  Given that the plan is only 60% funded, what amount of money - in dollars or euro - will be required in order to bridge the gap?  From where is that money likely to come and by how much would the various donor countries be obliged to increase the level of aid provided in order to make up the difference?<\/p><p>  Our guests have painted a pretty horrific picture of what is happening in the region.  It will necessary for peace to be brokered and for a level of stability to be restored before matters will improve.  The best way for our Parliament and the EU to assist is by ensuring that pressure continues to be exerted on the leaders in South Sudan.  Deputy Durkan referred to the imposition of sanctions and also to the human rights abuses that are taking place and the fact that no on is being brought to book in respect of them.

Criticism has been levelled at the UN, the EU and other entities for not taking action in the Horn of Africa despite the existence of those warning signs, namely, population movement, drought and conflict.  Our guests have intimated that a more or less similar situation is evolving in South Sudan at present, with the displacement and movement of people, atrocious weather conditions - including both drought and extremely wet weather - and conflict.  The similarities are striking.  Members of the committee visited Ethiopia three years ago and at the Togo refugee camp in the south of the country we met refugees from the Blue Nile region.  They informed us of the terrible atrocities they had endured and which had forced them to flee their homeland.  Obviously, the conflict there remains ongoing.  What are the UN, the African Union and other political entities doing in respect of this matter?  Pledges relating to financial contributions were made at the Oslo conference a few months ago.  Clearly, however, there is a need for a political settlement in order to ensure that the situation will not develop in the same way as that which arose in the Horn of Africa a number of years ago.

Concern always weighs up the risks involved and it is always an issue of risk versus need.  If there is no great need, then the pressure on us is not great.  When the need is great, however, we are obliged to make decisions on a daily basis as to who can go forward and who cannot.  Of course there are risks.  We are involved in food distribution, which brings with it a huge amount of risk.  What we have done is build extra barriers, brought in additional staff and tried to keep people back as much as possible from the actual distribution sites before letting them through gradually in a more controlled fashion.  We have also tried to focus on women at distribution points rather than men.  There are various security issues which we face on a daily basis.  However, we have good security controls in place.<\/p> <p>We have good communication systems, interaction and information sharing.  There is a good deal of coming together around security issues with the various NGOs and the United Nations to look at how to keep people safe, the best evacuation procedures and where people should stay.  There are major concerns and issues but we try to minimise the risks as much as possible.  However, at the end of the day, we have a job to do and people will take risks to do it.  Concern has 219 national staff working in South Sudan as well as 25 expatriates.  It is easy to consider the national staff as one group, but if we are working in Bentiu we cannot place Dinka there and we will not hire Nuer there.  Consequently we have to bring equatorial staff in there.  We have to consider the ethnic mix in every location where we are situated to ensure the staff are safe and that we are not fuelling conflict by bringing in undesirables, as perceived by the local populations.  These are all issues that we must take into consideration when we are planning for staff.<\/p><p> Reference was made to effective ways of holding people to account for what is going on in the country.  The International Criminal Court is there.  The ICC has done a good job with some people who have been brought to trial.  However, this is only a tiny portion of what needs to be done.  I am afraid there is increasing disrespect in various countries in Africa for the role and function of the ICC.  This disrespect has been led primarily by Kenya because the Kenyan President has been indicted for war crimes and is trying to generate the idea of Africa marching away from away from the ICC.  The court is looked on very unfavourably.  Bashir, the President of Sudan has already been indicted for war crimes and has never been picked up or presented.  He visits other African countries and there is no duty or perceived duty within other African countries to hand him over.  At the moment the court is not proving an effective deterrent instrument to deal with the conflict.<\/p><p> Let us consider the position of Salva Kiir Mayardit, the current President of South Sudan.  He came out of the jungle and the war and assumed the position of statesman three years ago, although for 40 or 50 years he had been fighting in the jungle.  It is an altogether different role for him and I am unsure how far he has made the transition from rebel fighter to statesman as well as taking on the role and responsibility of leader.  A leader has responsibilities for his citizens.  Whether we are referring to Riek Machar on the Nuer side of the coin or Salva Kiir Mayardit as the President, these leaders have responsibilities and obligations to their citizens.  The committee is right to suggest that they seem to look at the humanitarian issue as filling in the blanks for their non-recognition of the problems that conflict between their peoples are causing.  It is a major issue in terms of perception of what leadership roles are all about.  Again, an entire education field is necessary on that score in examining how to address issues of leadership.<\/p><p> Cholera is a major issue.  Concern is leading a working group in Juba dealing with cholera.  The committee is correct: at the moment over 40 people have died from the disease.  A recent estimate suggested that a further 100,000 people are directly at risk of suffering in the near future.  We are part of a working group that is putting out messaging relating to water and sanitation issues to try to control the spread and transmission of cholera in overcrowded areas.  The internally displaced people camps in Juba are not places where anyone would wish to live.  It is the same in Bentiu and some of the other IDP locations.  They are all at risk but we are looking at strong messaging and strong water and sanitation interventions to try to control the situation, as much as possible.  Furthermore, we try to link in with the medical organisations to ensure that they have stocks and supplies pre-positioned to enable a response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014061100007#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402496400,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I will come back to you again because clearly you have a good deal more to offer.

We have approximately 40 international staff and approximately 600 national staff in South Sudan the moment.  Reference was made to security.  I will add a little to what Ms O'Mahony has said.  One of the new dynamics since December has been the free movement of our national staff around the country.  We must be careful about who moves where according to ethnicity.  This is a major change for South Sudan.  It means that some of our international staff from Kenya and Uganda do not have freedom of movement.  There are certain areas they can go while there are other areas where they cannot and this has to be factored in when planning for our staff and security.  It is something we must continue to observe.<\/p><p>  A question was asked about whether the peace will hold and whether we were optimistic.  I would like to think that I would be optimistic but I am a little cynical.  The timing of the peace agreement is fortuitous.  We are heading into the rainy season and typically - any South Sudan observer would confirm it - this is when fighting slows down anyway because it has to slow down.  It is in everyone's interests that a peace accord is signed and I am hopeful that pressure can be brought to bear on the leaders and that they manage to hold the peace.<\/p><p>  One of the biggest challenges in recent months has been the translation of the high-level peace agreement to individual fighters on the ground.  There does not appear to be the necessary coherence from the top level down to the fighters on the ground.  All this makes me question whether some of the alliances of the anti-government forces or pro-government forces are true, whether they are banding together because they believe in something or simply because it is a good opportunity to gain ground or power.<\/p><p>  Questions were asked about how the peace agreement or new initiative can be made more effective.  I do not know.  If we knew the answer to that we would probably not be working for the organisations we are working for.  One of the reasons the peace agreement was signed yesterday was because there were threats of sanctions from the members of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development.  That was very interesting.  It was the first evidence of strong rhetoric from their peers and it seemed to have some kind of positive effect.  If such supports could be boosted by countries like Ireland and if the members of IGAD could be backed up and supported it would have benefits.<\/p><p>  My personal concern is that it is a little late.  The committee asked about the planting season.  The planting season is starting.  In normal years because of the challenges in South Sudan, including poor road infrastructure etc., agencies like ourselves would have pre-positioned supplies in advance.  That pre-positioning window is effectively closed now, at least in respect of road transport.  Therefore, we would have to consider a massive and expensive airlifting operation to get seeds and tools and so on into remote areas in order that people could actually plant on time.  My concern is that we are looking at weeks rather than months and I am unsure whether there is sufficient time to pre-position all the necessary stocks and supplies.  Perhaps other colleagues could comment on that.<\/p><p>  Deputy Eric Byrne asked about the role of Sudan, an interesting question.  Better and more seasoned commentators than I could comment on the role of Sudan but I believe there is an opportunity in respect of Sudan and what could be done from the Sudan side in terms of access and opening up corridors to allow some humanitarian access between the countries.  Recently I was in Sudan and I know that agencies there face similar challenges when it comes to trying to access newly-arrived populations from South Sudan.<\/p> <p>It is interesting that in North Sudan they cannot be called refugees, they are called displaced groups, which shows how North Sudan views the arrivals from South Sudan.  There would be opportunities should North Sudan be willing to assist.<\/p><p> Various people asked about tribalism.  I worry a bit about the oversimplification that can happen when we talk about tribalism.  It is true, however, that there have been very clear ethnic divisions in this recent conflict in South Sudan.  That harks back to the peace agreement signed all those years ago when there were opportunities to sow seeds of good governance that were not taken up.  The big lesson, should this fresh peace agreement hold, is that countries such as Ireland need to push harder for the international community to examine the underlying causes of conflict and truly try to grapple with those issues and areas of governance. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014061100008#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Gannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402497000,"counter":405,"content":"<p>We need to be cognisant that fragile and new states, such as South Sudan, need concerted support over a long period.  They cannot emerge on their own.  The temptation has been to withdraw or not to focus on that support within the region, where there has been some good leadership, with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, IGAD, and others, putting pressure on these countries.  They appreciate the regional implications of this.  Already we are servicing approximately 400,000 people in South Sudan and neighbouring countries.  The impact on host communities in poorer parts of neighbouring countries is pretty devastating.  That in itself begets conflict between new people and locals.  The international focus and attention on helping to build nations needs to be sustained, not just by the regional powers but the international community.  I will hand over to Mr. Byrne who returned from South Sudan last week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014061100009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Clarken"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402497000,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I will try not to repeat what has been said.  Without security there is no humanitarian response so we do take that extremely seriously, and we have an obligation, not just as humanitarian actors but also as employers.  We are all funded by Irish Aid in South Sudan, and as part of the broader regional response, and we have a contractual obligation to adhere to Irish Aid security management guidelines.  We have specialised security personnel on the ground.  It is important to emphasise that we all co-ordinate with one another.  We also have to be very careful about that and about how we communicate because it is not for us to be involved in military activity on the ground.<\/p><p>  Cholera is an important issue.  South Sudan has very little national and physical infrastructure, and very limited health services.  Only 15% of people have safe access to good sanitary conditions and 30% do not have safe access to clean water.  The conditions are ripe for the spread of cholera.  Our concern is that the outbreak seems to have started in Juba or at least that is where the initial cluster of cases happened.  There are also reports of it appearing across the country.  As Juba is the main urban centre, the main centre of population and a major trade route we fear that it will spread.  The good news is that the mortality rate as a result of cholera appears to be declining but it is still well in excess of what is considered safe.  We feel there may be efforts to start to contain it but there is much more work to do and we should be very careful not to be complacent about that.<\/p><p>  There has been significant international attention on the crisis.  The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, the UN special representative on genocide and the UN commissioner for human rights were there within a short period of one another at the start of May, prior to the signing of the re-commitment to the cessation of hostilities.  There was an increase in the level of international attention.  It is important to stress that it needs to be sustained for a long time.  We cannot afford to let it drop, which is part of the reason for our presence here today.<\/p><p>  Someone asked about political responsibility and the role of nations in the region.  We should acknowledge the role of IGAD in that there has been a recommitment to a cessation of hostilities.  An agreement was signed yesterday.  African states are beginning to take a stronger leadership role and to demonstrate stronger political support for peace negotiations.  Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda and Kenya are hosting refugees from this crisis.  Countries are taking responsibility, not only for the humanitarian response but also for the political process which is integral to a long-term political solution.  There is a tendency to get frustrated with Africa and we should be careful not to talk about Africa as a whole.  It is a country of many different states with huge cultural diversity and historical backgrounds of which we should be aware.  We should also acknowledge where progress has been made.<\/p><p>  Everybody has spoken about the planting window but I emphasise the concern that it may already be too late.  The planting season for a good crop yield will end in the early weeks of June.  A total of 1.3 million people have been displaced from their homes.  They will not return home unless they feel safe.  They will not be able to begin planting unless they have the seeds and tools to begin planting.  Physically and psychologically they are traumatised by the ravages of war.  We cannot expect suddenly to turn this around in the space of four to six weeks and expect everything to be ok.  It will not work like that.  Long-term support will be required to provide food, social and psychological support, shelter and medical assistance.  There is a great deal of work to be done to turn this around.  That is why we are stressing the urgency of timely, effective and flexible humanitarian funding.<\/p><p>  We should also stress that there have been development gains in South Sudan, over the past three to five years.  There is a risk that all of that will be undone right now, if we do not respond and make sure to provide humanitarian funding and funding for ongoing development activities.<\/p><p>  As to whether the current agreement will hold, there is a risk that we are too critical at the outset.  We need to give space and opportunity for the parties to the conflict to prove themselves.  IGAD has been very critical of the parties to the conflict for not respecting the cessation of hostilities agreement.  It has also demonstrated its ability to influence Riek Machar and President Kiir in the present context.  We should be hopeful but there is also an obligation on the international community to continue this sustained pressure, interest and engagement and to keep this on the international agenda because it will not be resolved overnight.<\/p> <p> The arms issue is very interesting.  Anyone who has worked in South Sudan will know that the use of arms is widespread and is part of the culture.  Even those in the cattle camps will carry a gun because this is the norm at this stage.  Decades of conflict have resulted in a proliferation of arms.  The international community needs to have respect for the arms trade treaty.  Many of these guns end up in South Sudan and in other countries affected by conflict because people sell arms or are prepared to allow the transit of arms through their countries and on to countries affected by conflict in the full knowledge that human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law will occur.  It is important to increase pressure on those states that have not signed the arms trade treaty and to show respect to those countries which have signed the treaty in order to keep this issue on the agenda.<\/p><p> The issue of sexual violence had not been discussed to a great degree until the launch of a number of reports on human rights.  The level of sexual violence in South Sudan has been quite horrific.  Ireland in particular has been very vocal on this issue of sexual violence and armed conflict and also on the issue of women, peace and security through the UN Security Council Resolution 1325.  We should continue to support the Friends of 1325, the EU and the UN to keep Resolution 1325 on the agenda.  I stress the importance of influencing the behaviour of armed groups and of those who bear arms on both sides and the civilian population but there is a need for increased respect for human rights and for international humanitarian law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014061100009#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402497600,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan who has a special interest in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014061100010#J00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1402497600,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I refer to South Sudan before this conflict broke out when it had two and a half years of relative peace.

The humanitarian community was looking for &euro;1.8 billion for 2014 and there was a funding gap of &euro;1.2 billion.  A further &euro;600 million was committed in Oslo, so there is currently a shortfall of &euro;600 million.  We are hopeful that the &euro;600 million committed in Oslo will translate into real commitments because in previous cases this has not happened.<br\/>I will address Deputy O'Sullivan's questions.  While the violence was triggered by the falling out between the president and the vice-president, there were other reasons.  For the past four years South Sudan has experienced a decline in <i>per capita<\/i>real income.  Following independence people had very high expectations for rapid improvements in their standard of living but instead there has been an increase of income and wealth inequality and the gap between the rich and the poor has increased significantly.  Different military groups were brought together in one army but they still reported to their ethnic leaders and when the conflict broke out it developed along the lines of ethnic groupings.  Probably in order to appease those involved in the previous conflict South Sudan had created over three dozen national Ministries and commissions.  The country is divided into ten states and each state has a large administration maintained at significant cost.  Over 70% of government expenditure goes towards payment of salaries of the armed forces and the police, leaving less to pay for the provision of basic services which in recent years have been supported by the donor communities.  <br\/>Seventy-two per cent of the population is aged under 30 years and most of these people will not have had the opportunity to attend school so they are poorly educated.  They have not experienced an improvement in their livelihoods and there have been very few opportunities available to them.  The young volatile population has been very ripe for manipulation by the various leaders and young men have become involved in the conflict.  I have seen this for myself in the camps in Juba which are supported by Concern.  One camp has a lot of young men and very few women and children.  On a few occasions the riot police have been called in when we are distributing humanitarian aid because the camp is very tense.  The young men in the camp are very frustrated and this can be a very dangerous situation, considering the ready availability of arms.  These factors have contributed to the ongoing conflict.<br\/>I refer to the question asked whether we can be sure that the people who need the aid are receiving it.  The UN has an established structure in South Sudan for the administration of aid.  The humanitarian country team is led by Toby Lanzer and it has done quite well in the circumstances.  The clusters are fully functioning and the humanitarian community as a whole has developed a crisis response plan and all agencies participate in the clusters.  We are aiming to have a multi-sectoral approach with a division of labour and duties in order to avoid duplication and to ensure the aid goes to where it is needed.  Last March, Concern made an attempt to send two trucks of supplies up to Bentiu and after three weeks on the road they had to come back because they could not go any further.<\/p> <p>In addition, they encountered numerous checkpoints where they were made to unload and reload their cargos by various groups who were looking for bribes.  The situation has been very difficult.  Moreover, it is a very expensive operation because so much of the material has to be transported by air.  Transporting food by air, for instance, is three times more expensive than doing so by road or barge.  The River Nile route was closed, for example, although I understand the UN is investigating whether it can be opened up in order to provide greater access to affected populations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014061100010#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Carol Morgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402498200,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates and apologise for having to leave the meeting to attend a debate and vote in the Seanad.

A great deal of information has been shared today and there has largely been consistency in terms of what the three key speakers have said.  We in GOAL have been lobbying institutional donors and governments for some years regarding the situation in South Sudan.  There is a lot of talk about transitional areas there, that is, areas which are moving into development from situations of humanitarian crisis or recovery.  We never saw full evidence of that, however, even though the funding streams were moving in that direction and the rhetoric around some of the programming was reflecting it.  We must keep in mind how long it will take to get back even to where we were before the conflict, which was not at all a positive place.  Prior to the current crisis, there was a degree of optimism and the organisations working on the ground, including the United Nations and donor governments, are all pushing in the same direction.  However, there remains an extremely long way to go.<\/p><p>  In terms of assessing the situation in South Sudan compared with that in other countries, it seems clear that we are looking at a ten to 15-year timeframe rather than five years or something of that order.  There must be a reality check in this regard.  This is an already exacerbated situation which is being made much worse.  There are deep-rooted issues that must be addressed as part of the resolution of the current crisis, which is essentially a cyclical response to those same issues.  If they are not addressed in depth and detail, the same problem will occur in the coming years.  From a value for money perspective as well as a humanitarian perspective, it should be the imperative of the international community to engage, once and for all, with conflict resolution in the region by grasping some of the nettles that have proved tricky in recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014061100011#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jonathan Edgar"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402498200,"counter":420,"content":"<p>An important point to make about South Sudan is that it is a country with enormous potential.  It has fantastic land which could be utilised in a very productive way and great waterways and water systems, including the Nile river.  It has vast quantities of oil - one might say it is sitting on an enormous lake - and the process of exploration is at the very beginning.  It has the potential to be a great nation.  Indeed, if we could just bang heads together and get people to work to build the country properly, it could be fantastic.<\/p><p>  However, as to whether we are optimistic for South Sudan's future, I have to say \"No\".  The conflict is too bitter, ingrained and intractable at this time.  Having said that, if there is sufficient international will, support and engagement, there is certainly hope that something can happen.  As an organisation, the situation in South Sudan has left us very stretched.  We are working with refugees in Ethiopia and Uganda and the internally displaced in South Sudan while continuing to run the longer-term development programmes in areas of South Sudan that are not part of the conflict.  We are also dealing with the Syrian crisis, further potential weather problems in Somalia, and we recently went into the Central African Republic.  These efforts are putting huge pressure on us as an organisation, as I am sure they are on my fellow delegates.  We have an obligation to deliver on our organisational humanitarian mandate and the situation in South Sudan represents a significant challenge for us all.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, the problems go on for South Sudan.  If this peace deal has a chance of survival it will give people a little hope, but only if all the other instruments go in around it to help with the nation-building process. We were not in a great place last December but we were at least making progress.  The outbreak of conflict at the end of the year set the country on a downward spiral which we must work together to address.  We are all here today for that reason, to consider how we can work together to check that downward spiral and get South Sudan back on track.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014061100011#K00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Mahony"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402498200,"counter":421,"content":"<p>It is our job on this side of the house not to despair.
