This opt-in will allow for an effective labour market access for protection applicants who have not received a first instance decision over a designated period of time.  I am confident that this decision to opt into the Directive is a very positive development for the entire protection system and for applicants and their families while they await a final decision on their application.  In addition to labour market access, the Directive also includes important provisions in relation to children&rsquo;s rights, health, education and material reception conditions for applicants, which includes housing, food, clothing and a daily expenses allowance. <\/p>  <p>  The Government initiated the opt-in process with the EU Commission which is on target to be completed in June.  Because this process takes some time, interim measures needed to be put in place.  Accordingly, Government decided that international protection applicants, as a category of non-EEA nationals, should come under the terms of the Employment Permits Act 2003 (as amended) which is the existing law governing the employment of all third country nationals.  Under that Act, persons can apply for an employment permit in certain sectors defined by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  In addition, I utilised my own powers to introduce a complementary self-employment scheme for eligible applicants (those in the system for over nine months without a first instance recommendation) &ndash; Ireland is one of very few European countries allowing such access.  This also ensured that a structure was available to vindicate the applicants&rsquo; right to labour market access on the day the prohibition was struck down. The total number of Self Employment applications received to date is 629, of which 430 have been granted.  <\/p>  <p>  I would stress that this interim scheme will be of very short duration until the opt-in process into the EU Directive is completed.  The process of compliance is on course to be completed within the planned timeframe.  Once this happens, access to the labour market will be underpinned by EU law and I will have the opportunity as Minister for Justice and Equality to bring to Government a new scheme granting effective access to the labour market for qualified applicants.  I expect that this permanent scheme will provide for a broader access to the labour market than the current work permits regime allows for all third country national migrants.  The details of this new scheme are well advanced and will be announced and commenced in the coming weeks in line with the commitments made previously. <\/p>  <p>  I am confident that this progressive approach by Government, which for the first time will see additional elements of our protection process subject to EU law and verification by the EU Commission, will be a further major effective and reforming step as we seek to improve the standards of our reception conditions and efficient determination of protection applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300069#WRA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300069#WRA01600"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[22687\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300069#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; attached to core Garda units in Cork city Garda division compared to 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1287","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":19,"content":"<p>I should say at the outset that the distribution of Garda personnel is exclusively the statutory responsibility of the Garda Commissioner<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in order to deliver an effective policing service, it is essential that Garda management have the flexibility to deploy Garda resources to meet operational policing needs and address critical issues as they arise.  For this reason, it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs at any given time.  The material requested by the Deputy is, therefore, not available in the manner requested. <\/p><p>By way of assistance to the Deputy, I am further informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Cork City Division in 2010 and on 30 April 2018, the latest date for which information is currently available, was 698 and 682 respectively.  There are also 42 Garda Reserves and 72 Garda civilian staff attached to the Cork City Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p><p>I can assure the House that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members. <\/p><p>Real, tangible progress has been made towards this goal. Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that in 2010 a previous Government closed the Garda College and imposed a moratorium - the measures imposed at that time had a negative impact on Garda numbers across all Divisions and the legacy of these decisions continues to have consequences for policing.  When it had brought about an early exit from the bailout and stabilized the public finances, in September 2014 the then Government reopened the College and since then just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are performing mainstream duties nationwide, 48 of whom have been assigned to the Cork City Division. <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years. This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment.  To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates a new recruitment drive was launched by the Commissioner last week with a closing date of 6 June.

I am sure the Deputy will agree that the conduct of such an audit, the first of its kind undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is of major significance in the context of the reform programme underway.  Reform of culture is generally recognised as one of, if not the, critical component in the transformation of any organisation, albeit one of the most difficult to achieve and sustain. <\/p>  <p>  I have discussed the report with the Commissioner and fully endorse his view that the report provides a valuable resource for the organisation and I share his view that it is of critical importance in informing the organisation's provision of the best supports to its people, which will in turn transform the service provided to the public.  <\/p>  <p>  It is encouraging that there was a strong response rate to the audit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with over 6,500 personnel &ndash; members, reserves and civilians &ndash; participating through a mix of methods including a survey, focus groups and interviews.  Based on this high level of participation, the report can be regarded as establishing a very strong and representative view of the organisation's culture.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the positives in the report including, in particular, the pride in the central role An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plays in protecting and supporting communities, the value personnel place on using police powers appropriately and acting with integrity and honesty; the esprit de corps, and the \"can do\" attitude. It is important that these positives are recognised and that they are not taken for granted.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to realise that these positive attributes can also become negatives if taken to extremes and, of course, the report also highlights key areas for improvement including in relation to how the leadership is perceived, how personnel are held to account, how those who speak up are treated, what is termed the \"supervision vacuum\" and the view, whether real or perceived, that the promotion process for the supervisory ranks is not merit-based. <\/p>  <p>  These are important issues that need to be considered in depth.  I am informed by the Commissioner that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is considering the report in order to formulate a considered and effective response to its insights and recommendations.  I understand that the senior leadership team has already met collectively to discuss the report with a view to specific actions being developed before the Autumn. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has, of course, a contribution to make in relation to a number of the areas identified as needing improvement including the areas of supervision and the perceived or real view that promotions at the level of sergeant and inspector are influenced by favouritism and nepotism.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to supervision it is critical that new Garda&iacute; have adequate supervision and support to carry out their duties in a manner that reflects the Code of Ethics that is now in place to guide the actions of all personnel.  I know that the Commissioner is fully seized of the importance of this. <\/p>  <p>  A number of competitions are currently in train to fill existing vacancies in the key supervisory ranks of Sergeant and Inspector with the aim of bringing the strength of these ranks to 2,000 and 300 respectively as agreed under the Employment Control Framework. <\/p>  <p>  It is not just about filling existing vacancies. It is also about ensuring that Garda&iacute; are doing the job that they are trained to do.  As part of the civilianisation process underway, close to 80 Garda&iacute; have been redeployed including seven sergeants and six inspectors.  I have made it clear to the Commissioner that I expect this to accelerate significantly this year.  To that end I welcome the fact that the Commissioner has directed that the redeployment of sergeants from administrative duties to frontline supervisory duties be prioritised in the short term to address any supervisory gaps. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will  be aware that the Government has agreed an overall vision for the Garda workforce of 21,000 by 2021 including 15,000 Garda&iacute;.  The Government is committed to ensuring that, as the number of Garda&iacute; increases towards 15,000, the sergeant and inspector ranks expand commensurately.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to promotion processes for the supervisory ranks it is important to note that the selection boards have a majority of external lay members appointed by the Policing Authority under the relevant Regulations. It is also important to say that the Commission on Public Service Appointments in its 2015 audit of the promotion process concluded that it was broadly satisfied that the processes incorporates adequate safeguards that protect the integrity of the selection processes and offers the necessary assurance that candidates are appointed on the basis of their interview performance.  That said, it is clear that there is scope for the modernisation of the processes and I welcome the conclusion of  the independent review commissioned by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The outcome of the review is under consideration by my Department with a view to an updated regulatory framework being developed and put in place for future competitions. <\/p>  <p>  The report of the culture audit also raises issues that touch on resources more broadly. These matters will be examined in the context of the upcoming estimates process for 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300069#WRA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300069#WRA02200"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[22700\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300069#WRA02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on whether the system of direct provision here is in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":25,"content":"<p>Direct Provision is the term used to describe the on arrival support system in Ireland whereby State services including accommodation, food, health and education are directly provided to international protection applicants through the relevant Government Department or Agency.

It remains a fact that we do not know how many people will arrive on our shores seeking international protection on any given day but, because of the Direct Provision system, we know for certain that all applicants, are offered immediate shelter, full board accommodation and a range of services, such as healthcare and education while their applications for international protection are being processed.

I can confirm for the Deputy that my Department is running an extensive consultation process at present, essentially around two questions: <\/p>  <p>  - The development of an agreed statement of what the Garda Youth Diversion Project (GYDP) service is &ndash; how it should operate, the range of interventions and supports deployed to assist participants in turning their lives around and to support their families and to prevent young people becoming involved in crime in the first place; the strong links required with other service providers and programmes that support communities, families and young people at risk to ensure effectiveness of the GYDP service; and the sense of local community participation and ownership of the work that is also critical to the design of programmes of work that take account of local circumstances and needs and thus have the potential to make a long-term impact; and <\/p>  <p>  - the optimum local geographical areas for organisation of individual projects with the objectives of keeping those strong links with local community and other service provider stakeholders that are essential to the successful operation of GYDP and of ensuring that the service is available throughout the State.<\/p>  <p>  It was originally envisaged that the consultation process would run to the end of April, but such has been the interest from local GYDPs and other stakeholders in participating and the number of requests for meetings that the opportunity to participate and make views known has been extended to mid-June.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has already had consultations with a number of young people who participate in GYDPs and that has been organised by a number of projects with assistance from the GYDP Best Practice Team, which works with my Department in the management of the project network.  My Department has also made arrangements with the Participation Hub in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for a formal consultation process to be undertaken by them also, which will also feed into this process.  A Steering Committee drawn from the various stakeholders within the GYDP network etc. has been established to advise on design of this process, including on arrangements for participation of young people in further design work and in a series of local consultation meetings.  The Steering Committee met on 17 May 2018 and arrangements are being made now to establish a small advisory group of young people who have participated in GYDPs and who will be charged with design of the local consultations with their peers, including the questions to be asked.  This work will be completed as soon as possible and the local consultations will take place over the next month or so.

There is ongoing contact between officials from my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure a proactive approach is taken to bring to justice those who seek to carry out such shocking murders and prevent further loss of life where possible. <\/p><p>The Government, for its part, is committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to tackle this and all forms of criminality in our State.<\/p><p>The House will be aware that Operation Hybrid was established to coordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and address concerns about community safety, particularly in the North East Inner City (NEIC).  This operation benefits from significant support by the Armed Support Unit.<\/p><p>As of 15 April 2018, the robust Garda response to the series of shootings perpetrated by violent criminals in Dublin has resulted in:<\/p><p>- 73 arrests;<\/p><p>- 13 charges in total (of which 10 charges related to murder investigations, 3 charges for related offences);<\/p><p>- 37 firearms seized (in relation to murder offences);<\/p><p>- In the region of 270 searches;<\/p><p>-16,514 lines of enquiry conducted with more than 57,317 high visibility checkpoints implemented with significant support from Armed Support Units; and<\/p><p>- A significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence has also been examined. <\/p><p>Indeed, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have stated that they have prevented in excess of 50 potential gang-related murders as a result of targeted policing operations since the incident at the Regency Hotel in 2016.  In addition, one person has been convicted in January of this year for a feud-related murder and other criminal trials are ongoing.<\/p><p>Along with vigorously pursuing the investigation of shootings and other violent incidents, Garda&iacute; have had significant successes in targeting the drugs trade, which fuels the activities of organised criminals.

In this context I would like to take this opportunity to commend the work of both the Spanish Authorities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which recently resulted in a significant seizure of drugs estimated to be valued at &euro;3.4 million and the arrest of five individuals, four of whom are Irish citizens.

For this reason, it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs at any given time. <\/p><p>I am informed that there are 148 Garda stations that are manned by a single member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, many of which are open part-time only.  I am further informed that they have the full support of their Divisional colleagues when required at the discretion of management.  In addition, when appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is augmented by a large number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Government, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, at the request of the Policing Authority, is carrying out a review of the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities.  The Authority has informed the Inspectorate that the review should take account of: <\/p><p>- the changing environments in rural, developing urban and suburban areas; <\/p><p>- the views of local communities; <\/p><p>- the allocation and deployment of Garda resources at the local policing level, including the use of the Garda Reserve, Garda facilities and Garda equipment; and <\/p><p>- relevant recommendations made in previous Inspectorate reports.<\/p><p>The review will be comprehensive including a consultative process with local communities.  It is the view of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate that the review should be completed within the first half of this year.<\/p><p>I can assure the House that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members. <\/p><p>Real, tangible progress has been made towards this goal. Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that in 2010 a previous Government closed the Garda College and imposed a moratorium - the measures imposed at that time had a negative impact on Garda numbers across all Divisions and the legacy of these decisions continues to have consequences for policing.  When it had brought about an early exit from the bailout and stabilized the public finances, in September 2014 the then Government reopened the College and since then just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are performing mainstream duties nationwide. <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years.  This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment.  To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates a new recruitment drive was launched by the Commissioner last week with a closing date of 6 June.  The competition is being undertaken by the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner and applications should be made to <i>www.publicjobs.ie.<\/i><\/p><p>In addition to the investment in more Garda&iacute;, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda Division as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream. <\/p><p>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to geographical area of the Garda stations manned by a single member of

Garda station since 2014 with the intent to increase Garda personnel at the station; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":43,"content":"<p>I should say at the outset that the distribution of Garda personnel is exclusively the statutory responsibility of the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware the Rathcoole Garda Station forms part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West Division. I am informed by the Commissioner that on 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the DMR West Division was 672 of whom 14 were assigned to Rathcoole Garda Station. There are also 26 Garda Reserves and 55 civilians attached to the Division. <\/p><p>I can assure the House that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members. <\/p><p>Real, tangible progress has been made towards this goal. Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that in 2010 a previous Government closed the Garda College and imposed a moratorium - the measures imposed at that time had a negative impact on Garda numbers across all Divisions and the legacy of these decisions continues to have consequences for policing.  When it had brought about an early exit from the bailout and stabilized the public finances, in September 2014 the then Government reopened the College and since then just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are performing mainstream duties nationwide, 155 of whom have been assigned to the DMR West Division. <\/p><p>It is important to appreciate that the increased specialisation within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na means that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to various Divisions does not include those assigned to various special bureaus or units and, of course, those Garda&iacute; are also undertaking critical policing work, e.g. the Garda  National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  More than 120 extra Garda were assigned to the specialist units within Special Crime Operations since 2017 alone.  <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years.  This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment.  To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates a new recruitment drive was launched by the Commissioner last week with a closing date of 6 June.  The competition is being undertaken by the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner and applications should be made to <i>www.publicjobs.ie.<\/i><\/p><p>In addition to the investment in more Garda&iacute;, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda Division, including the DMR West Division, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300069#WRA04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Law Cases","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300069#WRA04300"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[22378\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300069#WRA04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the current family court system will be examined, particularly with regard to County Kerry, to consider specific courts and judges to be assigned to family law cases; if the inclusion of a dedicated court room for family law, with consultation rooms, will be provided in the planning of the new infrastructure for Tralee courthouse; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[22865\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300069#WRA04500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if consideration will be given to a specific court and judges being assigned to family law cases in County Kerry; and if a dedicated court room for family law with consultation rooms will be included in the planning of the new infrastructure for Tralee courthouse; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 123 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to significant reform of the courts, including the establishment of a family law court structure that is streamlined, more efficient, and less costly.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently working on the General Scheme of a Family Court Bill, which will aim to streamline family law court processes, clarify jurisdictional issues and provide for a set of guiding principles to help ensure that the Family Court will operate in a user-friendly and efficient manner.  The intention is to establish a dedicated Family Court within the existing court structures.<\/p>  <p>  The Family Court Bill will support the provisions in the Mediation Act 2017 by encouraging greater use of alternative dispute resolution to assist in more timely resolution of family law cases. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is essential that there is proper planning and consultation with relevant stakeholders in order to ensure that the development of a new family court structure can be implemented smoothly and efficiently. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has established a working group, comprising officials from my Department, the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board, to examine the operational aspects relating to the Family Court.  The intention is that the working group will develop an overall architecture for the new family court structure.  The working group is consulting with other relevant stakeholders. Key issues arising in consultations include family court venues and facilities, resources and capital investment in family courts and integration of relevant family and child services to provide the best possible family law outcomes.   <\/p>  <p>  I hope to secure Government approval in the coming months for the General Scheme of a Family Court Bill. Once the General Scheme has been approved by Government, it will be referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and to the relevant Oireachtas Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions.  Furthermore, the scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business are matters for the Presidents of the Courts and the presiding judges who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. <\/p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that there is a high level of family law business in the District Court in Kerry.  The current waiting time from when a case is ready to proceed is 4 to 6 weeks for listing of new cases. Additional sitting days are being provided by the District Court Judge for the hearing of family law cases and the position is being kept under review. <\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that family law cases in the Circuit Court are actively managed by the County Registrar using case progression, motion days and call overs to ensure that business is dealt with as efficiently as possible.  When a family law case is ready to proceed in the Circuit Court in Kerry it is scheduled for the next sitting. Additional special sittings of the Circuit Court are sought where necessary if arrears arise.   <\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service has also informed me that as part of its provincial capital building programme, one of the objectives of the Courts Service is to provide improved court accommodation in Tralee with appropriate facilities for the hearing of family law and other court business. <\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service has further advised that it envisages a courthouse comprising four courtrooms and related consultation and other facilities as being required to meet current and future needs in Tralee.  The Courts Service is currently considering a number of options for the provision of appropriate court accommodation in Tralee including the level of extension and refurbishment achievable within the confines of the existing courthouse site; whether it would be feasible to acquire an adjacent town centre site and the degree of extension and refurbishment this would allow and the development of a new courthouse on an appropriate greenfield\/brownfield site.  The Courts Service has informed me that a decision has not yet been made and that all options are currently under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300069#WRA04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Procedures","counter":48,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300069#WRA04700"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[22689\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300069#WRA04800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 121 of 4 October 2017, the number of incidents since 2015 in which sums of money, confiscated money or evidence in a case were found to be missing, stolen or lost from a Garda station by the amount of missing, stolen or lost money involved, the date it was reported and the Garda station involved.","asker":"1276","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":50,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, I had initially sought a report from the Garda authorities in relation to this matter on 02 October 2017.

I am sure the Deputy will agree that the conduct of such an audit, the first of its kind undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is of major significance in the context of the reform programme underway.  Reform of culture is generally recognised as one of, if not the, critical component in the transformation of any organisation, albeit one of the most difficult to achieve and sustain. <\/p>  <p>  I have discussed the report with the Commissioner and fully endorse his view that the report provides a valuable resource for the organisation and I share his view that it is of critical importance in informing the organisation's provision of the best supports to its people, which will in turn transform the service provided to the public.  <\/p>  <p>  It is encouraging that there was a strong response rate to the audit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with over 6,500 personnel &ndash; members, reserves and civilians &ndash; participating through a mix of methods including a survey, focus groups and interviews.  Based on this high level of participation, the report can be regarded as establishing a very strong and representative view of the organisation's culture.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the positives in the report including, in particular, the pride in the central role An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plays in protecting and supporting communities, the value personnel place on using police powers appropriately and acting with integrity and honesty; the esprit de corps, and the \"can do\" attitude. It is important that these positives are recognised and that they are not taken for granted.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to realise that these positive attributes can also become negatives if taken to extremes and, of course, the report also highlights key areas for improvement including in relation to how the leadership is perceived, how personnel are held to account, how those who speak up are treated, what is termed the \"supervision vacuum\" and the view, whether real or perceived, that the promotion process for the supervisory ranks is not merit-based. <\/p>  <p>  These are important issues that need to be considered in depth.  I am informed by the Commissioner that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is considering the report in order to formulate a considered and effective response to its insights and recommendations.  I understand that the senior leadership team has already met collectively to discuss the report with a view to specific actions being developed before the Autumn. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has, of course, a contribution to make in relation to a number of the areas identified as needing improvement including the areas of supervision and the perceived or real view that promotions at the level of sergeant and inspector are influenced by favouritism and nepotism.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to supervision it is critical that new Garda&iacute; have adequate supervision and support to carry out their duties in a manner that reflects the Code of Ethics that is now in place to guide the actions of all personnel.  I know that the Commissioner is fully seized of the importance of this. <\/p>  <p>  A number of competitions are currently in train to fill existing vacancies in the key supervisory ranks of Sergeant and Inspector with the aim of bringing the strength of these ranks to 2,000 and 300 respectively as agreed under the Employment Control Framework. <\/p>  <p>  It is not just about filling existing vacancies. It is also about ensuring that Garda&iacute; are doing the job that they are trained to do.  As part of the civilianisation process underway, close to 80 Garda&iacute; have been redeployed including seven sergeants and six inspectors.  I have made it clear to the Commissioner that I expect this to accelerate significantly this year.  To that end I welcome the fact that the Commissioner has directed that the redeployment of sergeants from administrative duties to frontline supervisory duties be prioritised in the short term to address any supervisory gaps. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will  be aware that the Government has agreed an overall vision for the Garda workforce of 21,000 by 2021 including 15,000 Garda&iacute;.  The Government is committed to ensuring that, as the number of Garda&iacute; increases towards 15,000, the sergeant and inspector ranks expand commensurately.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to promotion processes for the supervisory ranks it is important to note that the selection boards have a majority of external lay members appointed by the Policing Authority under the relevant Regulations.  It is also important to say that the Commission on Public Service Appointments in its 2015 audit of the promotion process concluded that it was broadly satisfied that the processes incorporates adequate safeguards that protect the integrity of the selection processes and offers the necessary assurance that candidates are appointed on the basis of their interview performance.  That said, it is clear that there is scope for the modernisation of the processes and I welcome the conclusion of  the independent review commissioned by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The outcome of the review is under consideration by my Department with a view to an updated regulatory framework being developed and put in place for future competitions. <\/p>  <p>  The report of the culture audit also raises issues that touch on resources more broadly.

The youths in question then proceeded to engage in other serious anti-social behaviour and accost members of the public.  This is completely unacceptable behaviour and will not be tolerated. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that this incident is now the subject of an official investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in conjunction with Irish Rail, with CCTV footage being reviewed to help identify the culprits.  Photographs were also taken at the scene of the &lsquo;graffiti tags&rsquo; which are also being circulated in order to identify any links with known graffiti offenders and I would encourage anyone with information about this incident to contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as soon as possible<\/p>  <p>  In terms of tackling this particular type of crime, I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that Garda management engages extensively with transport operators and that a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to address incidents and issues that have arisen at specific locations.  There is ongoing communication between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the respective control centres, and access to good quality CCTV helps provide assistance to Garda&iacute; when investigating serious incidents, such as what we saw in Clongriffin recently.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na already employs a wide range of operational measures aimed at tackling public-order offences and anti-social behaviour.  These measures are underpinned by the existence of a comprehensive legal framework, which assists the Garda&iacute; in tackling this type of crime.  Of course, addressing local community concerns in relation to public order and anti-social behaviour is a key focus in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's National Community Policing Model and a range of strong legislative provisions are available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard, including those under: <\/p>  <p>  - the Criminal Damage Act 1991; <\/p>  <p>  - Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994;<\/p>  <p>  -  the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and <\/p>  <p>  - the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.<\/p>  <p>  For its part, the Government remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware that some &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018 and &euro;98.5m has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of these additional resources to the Commissioner is a key component in this Government's approach to improving public safety throughout the country which will undoubtedly benefit policing in relation to transport services in Dublin and in other areas.  In this regards I have no plans to engage with the Commissioner to progress a dedicated public transport unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the Dublin area.  Investment is instead being made in enhancing the resources available for policing generally. I believe this is the best use of scarce resources. <\/p>  <p>  A further consideration is the ongoing deliberations of the Commission on the Future of Policing.  Its terms of reference include consideration of the structures and management arrangements required for the most effective delivery of policing to meet the challenges of modern policing.

The most recent update shows that, between January and March 2018: <\/p>  <p>  - 628 calls were received on its complaints telephone line. <\/p>  <p>  - 500 complaints were received. <\/p>  <p>  - 490 complaints were closed. <\/p>  <p>  - There were 12 referrals from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for independent investigation under S.102(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act (2005). <\/p>  <p>  - There was 100% compliance rate in requests for documentation from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  - It took an average of 18 days for requests for information\/documentation from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be fulfilled. <\/p>  <p>  - 3 investigations were opened in the public interest.<\/p>  <p>  During the year 2017, GSOC referred 16 files to the Director of Public Prosecutions for direction compared to five in the previous year.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the efficiencies achieved by GSOC in the course of their activities, I am advised that in March 2017 the Commission initiated an internal strategic review of the organisation&rsquo;s processes, people and structures, resulting in the creation of a Business Improvement Team (BIT) compromising staff from all grades and business areas, which examined how GSOC operates under the existing legislation, what their current staffing requirements are, and what their future requirements would be in light of potential changes in the legislative and policing environment.  <\/p>  <p>  I met with the Chair of GSOC last September and discussed with her, among other things, the resourcing of GSOC.  I invited her to set out for me her best assessment of the overall resource requirements to provide the level of service that complainants, and all those interested in the effective and efficient investigation of complaints against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, expect and deserve.  Subsequently, in February 2018, a detailed business case proposal for additional resources was provided by GSOC.  My Department has sought some additional information from GSOC which it expects to receive very shortly.  Thereafter, my Department will engage with GSOC and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with a view to ensuring that GSOC is properly resourced to fulfil its very important functions.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, in December 2017 GSOC submitted proposals for changes to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 with a view to improving and streamlining the provision of its services.  These proposals are being examined in my Department at present.  I would point out to the House that the Commission on the Future of Policing is due to report later this year and I expect that its proposals will have implications for the current oversight structures.

It is a priority for me for the Government as reflected by its inclusion on the Government&rsquo;s list of priority legislation for publication during this Oireachtas session. <\/p>  <p>   This Bill will introduce mandatory reporting, post-mortem examination and inquest in cases of direct or indirect maternal death. It will also extend the legal aid provisions, introduced for certain inquests in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013, to a family member of the deceased at an inquest into a maternal death. <\/p>  <p>  This will ensure clarity for responsible persons, including hospital authorities, and will support the development of transparent and accountable oversight for checking and investigating certain types of death. Most importantly, it will provide clarity and transparency for bereaved families. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution made by the Deputy to the Bill, through her earlier Private Member's Bill. <\/p>  <p>   It will be an offence for a responsible person not to report a mandatory reportable death to the coroner. There will also be improved provisions on the reporting of certain peri-natal and infant deaths, to support prompt and transparent provision of information by health and other authorities to bereaved families. More broadly, the Bill will also update and strengthen the legal powers available to coroners regarding reporting, post-mortem and inquest of unnatural deaths; and including more robust powers to compel attendance by witnesses and the production of documents at inquest. The Bill will also allow a wider scope for inquests, from investigating the immediate cause of death to establishing the circumstances in which the death occurred.   <\/p>  <p>  The public importance of effective and transparent independent investigation in such cases is obvious. In addition, these measures will strengthen our compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights. <\/p>  <p>  We are awaiting a further full draft of the Bill from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. My officials continue to work intensively to advance this work. However, I agree that it is taking considerably longer than I had wished or that we had intended to finalise the Bill for publication.<\/p>  <p>  The reasons for this are genuine. It is a complex Bill, both in drafting terms and on the substance. While the Deputy's Bill and much of the work done by my Department on reforms relate to the text of the 2007 Coroners Bill, that Bill provided for a comprehensive reform of coronial law and of the administrative structure of the coroner service in Ireland. That administrative reform requires significant updating and is not yet ready to proceed. In drafting terms, it is a complex exercise to translate the key reforms we are seeking to make now, which are derived from or drafted in the framework of the 2007 Bill, into the structure and language of the existing legislation which dates from 1962.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy will be aware there is a huge amount of overall legislative activity &ndash; and even of priority legislation - at present in relation both to Private Members&rsquo; Bills, and to the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme, across a large number of fronts. The volume of legislative work means that the resource of the specialists who are available to do it is often spread very thinly.<\/p>  <p>  I am currently in further contact with the Attorney General to establish how the drafting can most quickly be completed. The Office of Parliamentary Counsel has assured my Department that they are very conscious of the timetable for this Bill and that, as a priority Bill in the Government Legislation Programme, they will make every effort to facilitate its delivery and publication before the end of the current D&aacute;il session.  I intend to move the Bill as early as possible after publication, so that, with the cooperation of all sides, we can facilitate its swift passage through the Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":82,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":83,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[22656\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been augmented to date; the degree to which the strength of the force will be increased in the future; if he expects stations in both urban and rural areas to benefit from the increase in the strength of the force; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":84,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly. <\/p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that on the 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was 13,632. There are also 562 Garda Reserves and more than 2,280 civilians attached to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years. This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment. To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates a new recruitment drive was launched by the Commissioner last week with a closing date of 6 June. The competition is being undertaken by the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner and applications should be made to www.publicjobs.ie.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the investment in more Garda&iacute;, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;. Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within both urban and rural communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda Division.<\/p>  <p>  In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Regulations","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB02000"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[22701\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he is satisfied that all bodies under his Department's remit are receiving value for money; his views on the 182 breaches amounting to &euro;45 million of public procurement guidelines in 2016; the steps he is taking to ensure this matter is resolved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":87,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to ensure that the voted allocations for the Justice Vote Group are expended in an effective and efficient manner to ensure value for money is obtained.<\/p>  <p>  The total budget for the Justice Vote Group in 2018 is in region of &euro;2.58 billion of which &euro;1.89 billion (74%) relates to payroll and superannuation; &euro;540 million (21%) is non pay current expenditure and &euro;144 million (5%) is capital related. There are six votes in the Justice Vote Group in 2018 and it is the responsibility of each Accounting Officer to ensure that all expenditure is properly expended and accounted for culminating in a Statement  of Internal Financial Control which accompanies the annual appropriation account for each Vote.<\/p>  <p>  There is a range of oversight measures in place across the Justice sector which supports the process of ensuring that value for money is derived from voted expenditure. A Financial Management Committee comprising of  the senior finance representatives from each of the Vote areas meets on a monthly basis to  review expenditure against budget across the entire Vote Group. In turn, the governance agreements in place with the various agencies and bodies under the remit of the Department reflect the need for appropriate financial and budgetary oversight and management and each Vote area has appropriate finance units and internal audit functions, relative to the size, legal framework, and complexity of the organisation in place. This further strengthens financial management across the sector to ensure that voted funding is spent appropriately and value for money is obtained.<\/p>  <p>  The specific figures cited by the Deputy refer in approximate terms to the supply arrangements reported under Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 40\/2002 across all of the Votes in the Justice Group in 2016. These relate to scenarios where tendering is not deemed feasible and a return is made to the Comptroller and Auditor General in compliance with that circular. It is important to point out that the vast majority of procurements are the subject of up to date tender competitions, many of which are now run in conjunction with the Office of Government Procurement.  Every effort is made to minimise the number of supply arrangements which fall to be reported under Circular 40\/02.  However, across Departments generally there will always be some procurement arrangements which fall to be reported under this circular including for example in relation to the proprietary nature of goods and services where there is a sole supplier of the goods or services in question or where annual licensing renewals arise including for example in relation to ICT software and systems. There are other situations where tendering may not always be feasible, such as where specific specialist knowledge is required, where urgency is a factor or where it has been necessary to extend a pre-existing contract for a period of time pending new tender competitions being completed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Investigations","counter":88,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB02300"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[22652\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 126 of 10 May 2018, if the report (details supplied) will be made available to persons who had co-operated with the investigation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":90,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that the enquiry into this matter was considered an operational matter and it was not envisaged that it would be published or furnished to any party to the enquiry.

The Act also affords very important protections to persons making protected disclosures and specifically included the GSOC as a designated body for receipt of protected disclosures. The protections afforded under the Act include protection from dismissal and other forms of penalisation and for the protection of the identity of persons making disclosures.  I am sure that the Deputy appreciates that the protection of whistleblowers rightly prioritises the confidentiality of the process, which is central to the efficacy of that process.<\/p>  <p>  A further point needs to be made. The protected disclosure that the Deputy refers to was not made to me as Minister. As I understand it, the protected disclosure was made directly to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) by the member. This House is well aware of the independence of GSOC so I need not labour the issue except to say GSOC&rsquo;s statutory independence prevents me from interfering in any matter that that body may or may not be investigating.  That is the guarantee of GSOC's independence and the guarantee to persons making complaints that their complaints will be considered independently and free from outside interference.<\/p>  <p>  I have full confidence in the role that GSOC plays in investigating complaints of wrongdoing in the Garda&iacute;, including protected disclosures from members.  Therefore, I urge members of this House to allow GSOC the time and space necessary to carry out its investigations.  What may seem like a simple enough issue to the member, can conceal layers of complexity that emerge only when an investigation gets under way.  Bear in mind that GSOC have a responsibility to persons making complaints as well as to those against whom allegations are made to carry out a full, complete and impartial investigation in order to arrive at the truth.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the specific member referred to in the Deputy's question, while there has been correspondence between my Department and the legal representatives of the Garda in question, the matters raised relate to workplace arrangements. There are matters raised in the correspondence that I, as Minister, cannot involve myself in but I have asked the Garda Commissioner for an up-to-date report.  <\/p>  <p>  I have to emphasise one point: I, as Minister, have no authority to direct the Garda Commissioner in matters concerning the control, operation and direction of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Nor can I interfere in any investigation undertaken, or being undertaken, by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Similarly, certain workplace issues which have also been raised in the correspondence are not matters in which I have authority to act, nor indeed would the Deputy wish me to have such authority.  These are properly matters for the Garda Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  This may be difficult for the Deputy to accept but he and others in this House would be quick to point out the flaws in any system which would allow any Minister for Justice to interfere with the role of the Garda Commissioner or to seek to direct the Garda Commissioner how to handle workplace issues or investigations. The Garda Commissioner is entitled to have the powers and independence of that office respected. GSOC are entitled to the same respect.<\/p>  <p>  I will await the outcome of any investigation that GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are pursuing and give consideration to what emerges.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I want to remind the House that term of reference [p] of the Disclosures Tribunal covers complaints by members of the Garda&iacute; who had made a protected disclosure prior to 16 February 2017 and who were, as a result, targeted or discredited with the knowledge or acquiescence of senior members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision Data","counter":94,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB02900"},{"type":"question","counter":95,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[22376\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons in direct provision according to age, gender and nationality; the length of time persons have been waiting to have their application processed; the number waiting for more than one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and ten years; the number and location of the accommodation centres; the annual cost of direct provision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":96,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware when a person comes to Ireland seeking international protection status under international law, the State offers inter alia full bed and board including all utilities, medical facilities ensuring the applicant&rsquo;s basic needs are met while their application is being processed.

The 2018 budget for this accommodation is &euro;66.6 million.  <\/p><p>On 31 December 2016, the International Protection Act 2015 (IPA 2015) was commenced, providing for the introduction of a single application procedure for people seeking international protection in the State.

Just 15 cases have been identified as pending in the IPO for more than 3 years and the length of time taken to process these particular cases may be due to the personal circumstances of the applicant.

As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that the strength of the Reserve on the 30 April 2018 was 562. It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013. The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways: firstly, 243 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointments Service (PAS) have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years. <\/p><p>The &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures. In line with this, the Government has in place a plan to achieve a Reserve strength of 2,000 by 2021. <\/p><p>With the plan to reach 15,000 Garda members well on track, it was possible for the Commissioner and the Public Appointments Service to undertake a new recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves last March. That competition attracted 2,394 applicants of whom 498 successfully completed the initial stages carried out by PAS. These applications are currently being processed by the Garda Appointments Office. The time frame for this can vary due to a number factors, including the length of the vetting process which may, for example, be more time consuming if the applicant has resided abroad or is deferred for medical reasons. It is expected that the first of the successful candidates will commence training in the Garda College in the coming months.<\/p><p>In conjunction with the major expansion of the Reserve over the next number of years, we must ensure that it is used to optimum effect to support effective policing. To inform future decisions around the use of the Reserve, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting a strategic review as a matter of priority with a view to completion in the first half of the year as set out in the Policing Plan 2018. <\/p><p>As a first step, the Garda Executive has taken a decision to transfer the management of the Reserve to the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for Community Engagement. This is intended to ensure that its development and deployment is viewed more broadly through a community policing lens. This is a very welcome step as it is my strong view that the greatest dividend to be gained from the Reserve is in terms of a visible presence on the ground and engaging with local communities.<\/p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the table the number of Reserves in each of the Cork Division as of 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are currently available.

The expert assessment is that while an attack here is possible, it is unlikely.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Authorities will continue to take all necessary security measures, supported where required by the Defence Forces, that are proportionate to the threat.  It would be unwise to disclose publicly the detail of those measures as that would simply serve to undermine their effectiveness.<\/p>  <p>  What I will say is that the Garda Authorities have in place robust tactical response, prevention and disruption capabilities to combat the terrorist threat. The considerable skills, expertise and resources of our Defence Forces are also available, as needed, in this regard.  The Authorities here exercise those capabilities, individually and jointly, publicly and privately on a regular basis to ensure preparedness. <\/p>  <p>  While there is a small number of people in Ireland whose activities in support of jihadist-type extremism give cause for concern, they are monitored on an ongoing basis with a view to preventing offences and securing evidence for prosecutions.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a small number of people, estimated to be in the order of 30 or so, who have travelled from Ireland to fight with jihadist-type groups in the conflict in Syria and Iraq.

The figures are broken down by Garda region and are voluminous in nature, but I hope the Deputy finds the information useful.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains committed to tackling public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities to reduce this type of behaviour and enhance community safety. The Garda approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities, businesses (in particular the night time economy) and other stakeholders to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour. <\/p>  <p>  In setting up the ASBO regime back in 2007, these interventions - warnings, good behaviour contracts and referrals to the Juvenile Diversion Programme - were intended to address the problem behaviour.  The rationale was that if they succeeded, there would be no need to apply to the courts for an order.  It was only if they failed to lead to a behaviour adjustment by the person in question that a court order would then be applied for.<\/p>  <p>  It is widely acknowledged the use of ASBOs is only suitable in certain circumstances and indeed it is only one crime prevention option open to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling this type of crime. As the Deputy will be aware, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na already employs a wide range of operational measures aimed at tackling public-order offences and anti-social behaviour. These measures are underpinned by a comprehensive legal framework. Of course, addressing local community concerns in relation to public order and anti-social behaviour is a key focus in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's National Community Policing Model and a range of strong legislative provisions are available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard, including those under:<\/p>  <p>   - the Criminal Damage Act 1991;<\/p>  <p>   - Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994;<\/p>  <p>   - the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and<\/p>  <p>   - the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.<\/p>  <p>  All forms of anti-social behaviour, particularly the type of behaviour we witnessed in Clongriffin recently, has no place in a civilised society.

There is ongoing contact between officials from the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure a proactive approach is taken to combatting those who seek to carry out such shocking murders and prevent further loss of life where possible. <\/p>  <p>  The Government, for its part, is committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to tackle this and all forms of criminality in our State .<\/p>  <p>  The House will be aware that Operation Hybrid was established to coordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and address concerns about community safety, particularly in the North East Inner City (NEIC). This operation benefits from significant support by the Armed Support Unit.<\/p>  <p>  As of 15 April 2018, the robust Garda response to the series of shootings perpetrated by violent criminals in Dublin has resulted in:<\/p>  <p> - 73 arrests;<\/p>  <p> - 13 charges in total (of which 10 charges related to murder investigations, 3 charges for related offences);<\/p>  <p> - 37 firearms seized (in relation to murder offences);<\/p>  <p> - In the region of 270 searches;<\/p>  <p> - 16,514 lines of enquiry conducted with more than 57,317 high visibility checkpoints implemented with significant support from Armed Support Units; and<\/p>  <p> - A significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence has also been examined. <\/p>  <p>  Indeed, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have stated that they have prevented in the region of 50 potential gang-related murders as a result of targeted policing operations since the incident at the Regency Hotel in February, 2016. In addition, one person has been convicted in January of this year for a feud-related murder and further criminal prosecutions are ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  Along with vigorously pursuing the investigation of shootings and other violent incidents, Garda&iacute; have had significant successes in targeting the drugs trade, which fuels the activities of organised criminals. In 2018 alone we have witnessed a series of very significant drugs seizures, as well as important seizures of firearms and significant banking information. <\/p>  <p>  We have also seen unprecedented international cooperation between Irish and Spanish authorities, leading to important arrests and seizures, with police officers from both jurisdictions participating in successful joint operations in Ireland and in Spain. In this context I would like to take this opportunity to commend the work of both the Spanish Authorities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which recently resulted in a significant seizure of drugs with an estimated value of &euro;3.4 million and the arrest of five individuals, four of whom are Irish citizens. These drugs were intercepted before they had a chance to be transported to Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Given the fluid nature of such criminal groupings it is extremely difficult to quantify the number of criminal gangs operating at any particular time. Splinter groups and new gangs can form overnight. Organised Crime is constantly evolving and new innovations in crime are continuously emerging.<\/p>  <p>  From time to time the question has arisen of providing for an offence of membership of a criminal gang in a manner similar to the approach taken in the Offences Against the State Acts with regard to membership of a proscribed organisation. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, it is important to understand the issues which arise in seeking to simply outlaw membership of a criminal gang in such a manner. Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have a similar permanency of organisation and structure that might pertain to a typical subversive organisation or other more fixed group.  Similarly, relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid with shifting memberships and alliances and a given individual's affiliation with a criminal network might itself be entirely contingent, contextual and ephemeral. As such, I do not believe that legislation along the lines of the Offences Against the State Acts with regard to membership of a proscribed organisation is necessary at this time. <\/p>  <p>  However, Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.  These offences include participation in a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation.  The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.  On conviction, this offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment. <\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such act actually takes place or not.     <\/p>  <p>  Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were introduced aiding prosecution for the offences under the Act.  <\/p>  <p>  Provision was also introduced so that where a serious offence is committed as part of or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that a comprehensive body of legislation exists to provide for the prosecution for offences relating to organised crime. I believe that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with the support of the significant additional resources provided to it by this Government, will prevail in facing down the threat of gangland violence in our communities. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have faced down this type of threat in the past and will do so again. <\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that in recent years a number of legislative measures have been introduced to tackle gang-related and associated crime. For example, the recent Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 provides additional powers for Garda&iacute;; in particular, powers to allow for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to prevent them being disposed of has been introduced and I am pleased that the provisions of this Act are available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na today.   <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the House that this Government remains entirely committed to ensuring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to have the resources required to tackle this, and all forms of criminality, in our State, and I believe we have strong legislative provisions in place to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in taking down these criminals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB05600"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[22653\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB05700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a person (details supplied) will be assisted to renew their GNIB card in view of the circumstances.","asker":"1238","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned applied for temporary residence in the State based on parentage of an Irish Citizen Child on 23 October 2017.

It is expected that the project will be tendered for in early Q3 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding future personnel levels at the station, it should be noted that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and, as Minister, I have no direct role in the matter.

As Minister I have no role in the matter.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, the Deputy will also be aware that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, at the request of the Policing Authority, is carrying out a review of the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities. The Authority has informed the Inspectorate that the review should take account of:<\/p>  <p>   - the changing environments in rural, developing urban and suburban areas;<\/p>  <p>   - the views of local communities;<\/p>  <p>   - the allocation to and deployment of Garda resources at the local policing level, including the use of the Garda Reserve, Garda facilities and Garda equipment; and<\/p>  <p>   - relevant recommendations made in previous Inspectorate reports.<\/p>  <p>  It is expected that the review will be completed within the first half of 2018.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as of the 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, the strength of the Donegal Division was 394. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the House that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members. <\/p>  <p>  Real, tangible progress has been made towards this goal. Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in 2010 a previous government closed the Garda College and imposed a moratorium - the measures imposed at that time had a negative impact on Garda numbers across all Divisions and the legacy of these decisions continues to have consequences for policing. When it had brought about an early exit from the bailout and stabilized the public finances, in September 2014 the then Government reopened the College and since thenjust under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are performing mainstream duties nationwide, 32 of whom have been assigned to the Donegal Division. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years. This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment. To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates a new recruitment drive was launched by the Commissioner last week with a closing date of 6 June. The competition is being undertaken by the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner and applications should be made to www.publicjobs.ie.<\/p>  <p>  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;. Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda division, including the Donegal Division, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Internet Safety","counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB06200"},{"type":"question","counter":128,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[22702\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300070#WRB06300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the ramifications of setting the digital age of consent at 16 years of age; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1294","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":129,"content":"<p>The position is that Article 8 of the GDPR specifies a &lsquo;digital age of consent&rsquo; of 16 years but allows Member States to provide for a lower age, but not below 13 years. It will mean that providers of information society services must make reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the holder of parental responsibility over the child where such services are offered directly to children below the specified age threshold. <\/p>  <p>  In late 2016, my Department launched a consultation process and invited submissions from interested parties on the digital age of consent to apply in this jurisdiction. The Government Data Forum, which brings together legal and data protection experts, business representatives from SMEs and multinationals, as well as sociologists, psychologists and education specialists, also carried out a consultation process. <\/p>  <p>  A majority of respondents - including the Ombudsman for Children's Office, ISPCC, the Children's Rights Alliance, the Internet Safety Advisory Committee - recommended adoption of a digital age of consent of 13 years. Based on the responses received, including those mentioned, the Government decided that 13 years represented an appropriate balancing of children&rsquo;s rights, namely a child&rsquo;s right to participation in the online environment and a child&rsquo;s right to safety and protection.  As the Deputy will be aware, these rights are enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Government was also mindful that a digital age of consent of 16 years might prove difficult to enforce, not least because &lsquo;tech-savvy&rsquo; 13, 14 and 15 year olds would have more than sufficient knowledge and IT literacy to enable them to circumvent the requirement for parental consent.<\/p>  <p>  The Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr Geoffrey Shannon, also recommended setting the digital age of consent at 13 years during pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Data Protection Bill, and that recommendation was endorsed by the Joint Committee in their Report on the Bill in November last.<\/p>  <p>  It is therefore disappointing that in the course of D&aacute;il Report Stage discussion on the Data Protection Bill, an opposition amendment to increase the digital age of consent from 13 years to 16 years was carried. Section 31(1) now provides that digital age of consent shall be 16 years. However, subsection(3) of section 31 provides for a review of the age set out in subsection (1) within 3 years of the coming into force of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of children below the digital age of consent, Article 8(2) of the GDPR requires providers of information society services to make &ldquo;reasonable efforts&rdquo; to verify that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available technology.

This included my attendance on 14 May at the General Affairs Council (Article 50), at which Michel Barnier updated the EU27 Member States on the current state of play in the negotiations. The document to which the Deputy refers is a slide used by Mr Barnier during the course of his presentation, providing a visual representation of how key elements of the future EU-UK relationship identified in the EU Guidelines might be advanced and the governance frameworks that would underpin them.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has always been clear that we want the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK and so I welcome the confirmation in the March European Council Guidelines of the EU&rsquo;s determination to have as close as possible a partnership with the UK in the future.<\/p>  <p>  These Guidelines also confirmed the EU&rsquo;s readiness to start work towards a balanced, ambitious and wide-ranging free trade agreement (FTA). While an FTA is not Ireland&rsquo;s preferred end goal, we recognise that the European Council has to take into account the repeatedly stated positions of the UK, including its wish to leave the Single Market and Customs Union, which limit the depth of the future partnership.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the EU will enter negotiations on the future relationship with an open, positive and constructive mind, which will be important should the UK&rsquo;s position evolve during the negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland also shares the EU view that any future agreement must have the correct balance of rights and obligations, and that the integrity of the Single Market must be preserved. This is in Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interests as membership of the Single Market is a core element of our economic strategy. Furthermore, the Government will continue to be firm in arguing that any agreement must protect key sectors of the Irish economy given the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and importance of our economic relationship with the UK.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council guidelines also confirm that the EU&rsquo;s future partnership with the UK will cover not just trade and economic cooperation but also other important areas, in particular the fight against terrorism and international crime, as well as security, defence and foreign policy. <\/p>  <p>  The aim of the current negotiations is to agree alongside the EU-UK withdrawal agreement a framework for the future relations. This is because the actual agreement on a future relationship can only be finalised and concluded once the UK has become a third country, after it leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. The framework will set the objectives and scope of the detailed negotiations leading to legally binding future relationship agreement or agreements. This is why a status quo transitional arrangement is so important and so I welcome the conditional agreement reached in March on an orderly transition period. Of course, it is in the interest of everyone that a future relationship agreement is concluded as quickly as possible after the UK leaves the EU to provide certainty sooner rather than later. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300071#WRC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":153,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300071#WRC02500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300071#WRC02400"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[22764\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300071#WRC02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the impact of the section 481 tax break on the film industry and job promotion here by region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1357","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":154,"content":"<p>Section 481 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that companies which make films in Ireland can avail of a refundable tax credit in respect of eligible expenditure incurred on the making of that film.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Eligible expenditure includes amounts incurred on employing individuals and on acquiring goods and services from Irish businesses.\u00a0 Both aspects must relate to work done in the State, i.e. employees must perform their duties in the State and goods and services must be used up in the State.<\/p><p>The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht must approve the film as relating either to Irish culture, or acting as a stimulus to film making in the State through, amongst other things, the provision of quality employment and training opportunities (Regulation 7(a) and (b) Film Regulations 2015).\u00a0 The Minister can require that the film company engage a certain number of trainees for the making of the film. <\/p><p>It is not possible to track the impact of the credit by regions as, for example, the company claiming the credit may be based in Dublin but the filming may take place in Cork.

The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million.

We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide of whom 31\u00a0have been assigned to the\u00a0Wicklow Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years. This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment. To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates a new recruitment drive was launched by the Commissioner last week with a closing date of\u00a06 June. The competition is being undertaken by the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner and applications should be made to <i>www.publicjobs.ie.<\/i><\/p><p>In addition to the investment in more Garda&iacute;, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the\u00a0Wicklow Division.<\/p><p>For the Deputy's information \u00a0I have set out in the following tables\u00a0the number of Garda&iacute;

Furthermore, the scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the Presidents of the\u00a0Courts and the presiding judges who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has\u00a0advised that, in general, waiting times are being maintained or reduced across jurisdictions. The Presidents of the Courts keep\u00a0waiting times under ongoing review. The Courts Service continues to work with the Presidents and the judiciary to\u00a0improve waiting times and, where specific issues are identified, resources are targeted at areas of greatest need. Additional sittings are arranged where necessary and possible within resources available. <\/p><p>The Courts Service has further advised that delays in the hearing of cases can occur for a number of reasons, many of which are outside the control of the Courts and the Courts Service, for example, the unavailability of a witness or vital evidence, delays in the furnishing of reports or because the parties and\/or legal practitioners are not ready to proceed on allocated dates. This gives rise to adjournments which can have a major impact on the time taken to complete the hearing of a case and on the number of cases which can be disposed of in a court sitting.\u00a0Increased volumes of cases coming before the courts, increased complexity of cases, leading to longer hearing times, and new areas of litigation can also impact on waiting times.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Tables outlining the waiting times\u00a0in\u00a0each court at December 2015, 2016 and\u00a02017 can be found at the link at the end of this reply.\u00a0The Courts Service has\u00a0informed me\u00a0that waiting times refer to the time taken from when a case is indicated as ready to proceed and it coming before the court. The average waiting times for the various courts for 2015 and 2016 are\u00a0provided in the Courts Service Annual Reports and the average waiting times for 2017 will be published in the 2017 Annual Report.<\/p><p>As the Deputy\u00a0will be\u00a0aware, judicial appointments are made by the President acting on the advice of the Government in accordance with articles 13.9 and 35.1 of the Constitution. The following number of judicial appointments have been made\u00a0since 2015\u00a0to fill vacancies and implement legislative changes to judicial numbers:<\/p><p>2015 - 15<\/p><p>2016 - 11<\/p><p>2017 - 16<\/p><p>2018 to date - 5<\/p><p>The Government endeavours to ensure that all judicial vacancies at all jurisdictional levels are filled as quickly as possible. Judicial resources\u00a0available to the courts are kept under ongoing review and applications for additional judicial resources from the Chief Justice and the Presidents of the Courts are fully considered to ensure that the courts have adequate judicial resources.<\/p><p>Furthermore, as\u00a0the Deputy may be aware, a Group to review the administration of civil justice in the State, chaired by the President of the High Court Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, was established in 2017. This Group is to report to me within two years, and will make recommendations for changes with a view to improving access to civil justice in the State, promoting early resolution of disputes, reducing the cost of litigation, creating a more responsive and proportionate system and ensuring better outcomes for court users. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300072#WRD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Prosecutions Data","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300072#WRD02100"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[22793\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300072#WRD02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of prosecutions taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of unlicensed gaming activity for non-compliance with gaming licensing requirements in each of the years 2014 to 2017 and to date in 2018 in each Garda district in Dublin in tabular form; and the number of those that led to successful convictions.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":208,"content":"<p>I have requested a report from the\u00a0Garda authorities regarding the information sought by the Deputy and I will contact him directly when the report is to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300072#WRD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gangland Crime","counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300072#WRD02400"},{"type":"question","counter":210,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[22818\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300072#WRD02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which the identity of the membership of criminal gangs is known; if such membership can be targeted in order to limit the activity and influence of such gangs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":211,"content":"<p>As I have indicated previously,\u00a0tackling organised crime activity is a key ongoing priority for both the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Policing Plan sets out the priorities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling organised crime activity including its continued commitment to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in criminal activity, including organised criminal activities.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that significant additional resources have been allocated and deployed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the last few years to target the activities of criminal gangs.\u00a0 In tackling such activity, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement operations and strategies aimed at targeting, dismantling and disrupting criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies. Multi-disciplinary approaches are also utilised to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted, including through the use of the proceeds of crime legislation, money-laundering legislation, the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 relating to organised crime and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau. <\/p>  <p>  While we should not underestimate the difficulties which the Garda authorities face in tackling organised crime activity, we continue to see the significant results of their efforts in the arrests made and persons being brought before the Courts, as well as the ongoing drugs and firearms seizures made.<\/p>  <p>  The question of providing for an offence of membership of a criminal gang, in a manner similar to the approach taken in the Offences Against the State Acts with regard to membership of a proscribed organisation,\u00a0has arisen from time to time. In this regard, it is important to understand the issues which arise in seeking to simply outlaw membership of a criminal gang in such a manner. Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation or other more fixed group would have.\u00a0 Relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid with shifting memberships,\u00a0alliances and a membership which may depend on circumstance.\u00a0  <\/p>  <p>  However, criminal legislation has been updated in recent years, with a view to ensuring that it provides a comprehensive range of provisions for the prosecution and punishment of crime, in particular the activities of those involved in organised crime.\u00a0 Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.\u00a0 These offences include participation in a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation.\u00a0 The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.\u00a0 On conviction, this offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment.  <\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as\u00a0amended) also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such an act actually takes place or not.\u00a0Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were introduced aiding prosecution for the offences under the Act.\u00a0Provision was also introduced so that where a serious offence is committed as part of or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300072#WRD02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Data","counter":212,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300072#WRD02700"},{"type":"question","counter":213,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[22819\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300072#WRD02800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which criminal gang members have been offered rehabilitative or educational training while in prison; the number that have had more than one referral for such training; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":214,"content":"<p>I wish to advise\u00a0the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service provides a wide range of\u00a0rehabilitative programmes to those in custody that include education,\u00a0vocational training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, counselling,\u00a0welfare and spiritual services.

Some &euro;46 million was allocated for investment in the Garda fleet to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit for purpose fleet. This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the fleet in the period 2013 to 2015.

This major investment will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime and will facilitate progress on important reforms arising from the Garda Inspectorate's report on Crime Investigation.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of progress on this important initiative, I am informed by the Commissioner that a draft Community Policing Framework which outlines the manner in which Community Policing Teams and Community Safety Fora will be established has been completed and is subject to internal review before being approved by the Executive for implementation.

Garda&iacute; engage with a wide range of community based groups, as well in more formal settings such as Joint Policing Committees, to ensure that local issues can be aired and appropriate partnerships formed with communities to address matters of concern. Garda&iacute; also support over 3,700 Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch Schemes nationwide, and these form an important partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent crime and protect communities, especially the elderly and more vulnerable persons. In addition, the Garda Text Alert Scheme provides an effective means for Garda&iacute; to communicate crime prevention information to local communities.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.

A key component of that work has involved building technical capacity and situational awareness as to trends and developments around Network and Information Security generally, and particularly those risks that might arise for Government and Critical Infrastructure. The NCSC operates an Advisories and Alerts System which allows the unit rapidly disseminate\u00a0information to Government Departments, Agencies and Critical Infrastructure Operators. These entities have signed up to this formally managed system, which is governed by a Traffic Light Protocol (or TLP) setting out the manner in which any information contained therein should be treated. This system presently has around 120 constituents and has recently been augmented with an SMS alert system.<\/p>  <p>  On 17th April 2018, the NCSC issued an Advisory related to\u00a0the issues referred to by\u00a0the Deputy in his question, setting out the nature of the threats, and the precise types\u00a0of equipment\u00a0that have been targeted. The Advisory also contained a series of mitigation measures that constituents should consider, and a reminder that any incidents, of this or any type, should be reported to the NCSC. The Advisory carried a TLP AMBER rating. The NCSC remains in contact with similar bodies in other jurisdictions and any further pertinent information will be passed to constituents as soon as it is received. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSC is also engaged in a series of other actions in this area. For example,\u00a0a new website for the NCSC has been launched, and this will shortly be updated with information to assist individuals and small and medium sized businesses to protect their information systems. The unit has also been heavily engaged in work to prepare for the EU Network and Information Security Directive, which will place binding security requirements on critical infrastructure operators and certain key Digital Service Providers. The Directive also places obligations on the State itself, in terms of ensuring that States can cooperate and share information in the event of a large scale incident affecting several countries and to ensure that every State has significant capacity of its own. To that end, the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) within the NCSC received international accreditation in 2017 and plays an active role in a number of European and international organisations. The unit also participates in international exercises, including an upcoming European aviation security event. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also working on a new National Cyber Security Strategy, which will set out a series of measures to be taken in the coming years across the public and private sector.

Neither I nor the Pensions Authority has the power under legislation to intervene to compel an employer to continue to make contributions to a scheme.  Even where a scheme is closed to new members or to future accrual of benefits, the sponsoring employer role continues in relation to that scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Almost all Irish defined benefit schemes have a rule that allows the employer to cease contributions, usually after a notice period.  Currently there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions and no further liability on the employer where contributions cease.  Neither is there an obligation on the employer to give notice to members or to consult in advance of ceasing contributions.<\/p>  <p>  However, in the case where a restructuring of benefits is proposed, the employer and the trustees of a pension scheme are required to notify scheme members, beneficiaries and the authorised trade unions.  Furthermore, changes made to the Occupational Pension Schemes (Section 50 and 50B) Regulations in 2015 require trustees to also notify groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members in a scheme in such a situation.<\/p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform, which was published recently, details specific measures that will modernise our pension system.  It sets out under Strand 4, &lsquo;Measures to Support the Operation of Defined Benefit Schemes&rsquo;, that the Government is committed to advancing the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  The purpose of this Bill is to respond to the ongoing difficulties in DB schemes and to increase protections for members as well as encouraging employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and managed.<\/p>  <p>  The general scheme of the Bill, which was published in May 2017, contained a number of key measures relating to DB pension schemes.  These proposed provisions will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing a 12 month notification period where an employer is seeking to cease making contributions to a scheme.  The amendments seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions.  The measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments also provide for more frequent monitoring of the financial position of schemes and will further provide that, where a scheme is in deficit and a funding proposal has not been put in place in a timely manner, the Pensions Authority may direct steps to be taken to ensure that the scheme meets the funding standard.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that if this new legislation is enacted, a scheme will have to give a minimum notice period of twelve months before contributions can be stopped.  However, it will not prevent a company from ceasing contributions once the minimum notice period is served provided the scheme meets the Minimum Funding Standard. <\/p>  <p>  These provisions are quite technical and complex.  Work to finalise them is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in position to bring forward the amendments at Committee Stage at the end of May or early June. With the cooperation of the Oireachtas, the Government intends to pass this legislation before the summer recess.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300076#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300076#WRH02000"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[22742\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300076#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of a scheme (details supplied).","asker":"1323","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":437,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[22746\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300076#WRH02200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of a scheme (details supplied).","asker":"1323","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":438,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 185 and 186 together.<\/p><p>It is the responsibility of the employer to pay pension contributions on behalf of his\/her employees to Pension Trustees.

While the report indicates that intermediary employment arrangements can be abused to the detriment of workers and can distort the transparent and efficient operation of the labour market, it also notes that contract for service arrangements can provide flexibility, in many instances, for both businesses and workers, where they are freely chosen by both parties.<\/p>  <p>  The report estimates potential losses based on various employment and earnings scenarios. The potential loss from various self-employment arrangements ranges from c &euro;5,000 per annum at average industrial earnings, c &euro;9,000 per annum at an earnings level of &euro;60,000 and c &euro;15,000 per annum at a salary of &euro;100,000. <\/p>  <p>  There are an estimated 15,000 people employed in personal service companies and managed service companies.

Irish Water, as a single publicly owned national water services authority, is taking a strategic, nationwide national utility approach to asset planning and investment, and meeting customer requirements.<\/p><p>Irish Water&rsquo;s Water Services Strategic Plan (WSSP) published in 2015 sets out the strategic objectives for its delivery of water services over 25 years up to 2040 in order to ensure the provision of clean safe drinking water, effective management of wastewater, environmental protection and support for social and economic development. The Irish Water Business Plan, Transforming Water Services in Ireland to 2021 (also published in 2015), sets out its short to medium term planning in implementing the first phase of the Water Services Strategic Plan.<\/p><p>Irish Water is regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) as the independent economic regulator. The CRU is responsible for setting the total level of revenue which Irish Water can receive, through Government subvention and from customers, to cover its efficiently incurred costs. This CRU process involves, <i>inter alia<\/i>, reviewing submissions from Irish Water, including on its investment plan, and thereafter setting appropriate revenue allowances for operating costs, capital costs and other items for given regulatory periods. Consequently, the actual allowed operational expenditure and capital investment is decided by the CRU.<\/p><p>On 21 May 2018, I published the Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025 following its approval by Government. The Policy Statement gives clear direction to strategic planning and decision making on water and wastewater services in Ireland.  The Policy Statement sets out a series of high-level policy objectives across the three thematic areas of Quality, Conservation, and Future Proofing, which must be pursued when planning capital investment and framing current spending plans. The Policy Statement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<\/p><p>www.housing.gov.ie\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/files\/water_services_policy_statement_2018-2025_0.pdf.<\/p><p>Within 3 months of publication of the Policy Statement, Irish Water must prepare a &lsquo;Strategic Funding Plan&rsquo; setting out proposed operational and capital expenditure.  Subject to its approval by me as Minister, the Strategic Funding Plan will ultimately feed into annual Exchequer decisions on spending.<\/p><p>Based on this Strategic Funding Plan, Irish Water&rsquo;s next Capital Investment Plan for the five year period from 2020 to 2024 will set out the financial plan for capital investments to support Irish Water&rsquo;s strategic objectives, as set out in the WSSP and in its Business Plan, to deliver improvements to water services where they are needed most. Irish Water will also take account of developing subsidiary programmes within its investment plan to assist in implementing the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan including the forthcoming Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies as well as ongoing reviews of local authority statutory land use plans. It is in that context that investment decisions in relation to individual projects will be made.<\/p><p>In the context of the Rural Water Programme my Department made enquiries with Mayo County Council which indicate that the Council recently engaged with the Murrisk and Lecanvey community with a view to them forming a Group Water Scheme for the area subject to co-funding under my Department&rsquo;s Rural Water Programme. Such a Group Water Scheme for the area would be sourced from a public water connection provided by Irish Water. I understand that the Rural Water Section of the Council continue to be available to engage with the community on this option.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300077#WRJ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Appeals","counter":489,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300077#WRJ01600"},{"type":"question","counter":490,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[22856\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300077#WRJ01700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if there is a significant backlog in the time taken for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to deal with appeals; the average waiting time before appeals are decided; if priority is given to applications that go directly to the board; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":491,"content":"<p>Under Section 126 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has a statutory objective to determine planning appeals within 18 weeks. Where the Board does not consider it possible or appropriate to reach a decision within 18 weeks (e.g. because of the particular complexities of a case or the requirement to hold an oral hearing), it will inform the parties of the reasons for this, and will indicate when it intends to make its decision. <\/p>  <p>  Measured on an annual basis, the compliance rate with the statutory objective period for normal planning appeals was 64% in 2017, and the average time taken to determine those cases was 16.8 weeks, down from a 82% compliance rate and an average determination time of 15.5 weeks in 2016.\u00a0 The reduction in the compliance rate can be\u00a0attributed to a number of factors.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Firstly, there was a reduction in Board capacity in mid-2017, arising from a time interval between the departure of five outgoing Board members, whose terms of office had expired in April and May, and the five new replacement Board members taking up their posts.\u00a0 While by September 2017 the Board complement had been fully replenished, this time interval impacted on the Board&rsquo;s case work output. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is also implementing a major ICT strategy which will facilitate the introduction of on-line planning services as part of an complete upgrade and replacement of core systems.\u00a0 In this regard, a new case management system was installed and became operational in Q4 2017.\u00a0\u00a0As\u00a0is to\u00a0be expected with such a fundamental and integrated project, the transition to the new system has caused some initial disruption to the processing of cases, resulting in a further increase in the backlog of cases on hand.\u00a0\u00a0However, measures are being put in place to ensure that the new system is bedded down and becomes operational at an optimal level. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, during this\u00a0period, there has been a general\u00a0increase in cases received by the Board.\u00a0 For example, there was an increase of almost 12% on normal planning appeals received in 2017 compared to 2016.\u00a0 This upward trend has continued into 2018.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Now that the Board's full complement has been restored, combined with the measures that are being put in place in relation to the new ICT systems, it is expected that the backlog of cases will begin to reduce over the coming months, with an associated improvement in the compliance rate with the statutory objective period.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to priority cases being dealt with by the Board, since July 2017, the Board has been determining planning applications for strategic housing developments (SHDs) made directly to it within the 16-week timeframe prescribed for such planning applications under the provisions of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.\u00a0 At end-April 2018, 24 SHD planning applications had been made, with the Board issuing decisions in 16 cases, all of which were made within the prescribed 16-week timeframe.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, having regard to these additional functions, a new Strategic Housing Division of the Board has been established to decide on these applications, involving the recruitment of an additional dedicated 10 professional and administrative staff members in 2017.\u00a0 Two additional Boards members have also been sanctioned to serve this Division, with the first Board appointment being made in February this year and\u00a0the second Board member due to take up duty in June.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in line with Government policy in relation to the provision of housing supply, all planning appeals in respect of housing developments of 30 units or more are prioritised by the Board for decision. The Board also prioritises developments which have a significant employment or economic potential on a national, regional or local scale as well as new, and extensions to, school buildings and educational facilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300077#WRJ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":493,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300077#WRJ02000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Film Industry Development","counter":492,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300077#WRJ01900"},{"type":"question","counter":493,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[22752\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300077#WRJ02000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the measures being taken to expand the film industry in the mid-east region in view of the sale of the 32% shareholding in a studio (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1357","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":494,"content":"<p>The sale of the shareholding in the studio referred to by the Deputy is first and foremost a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Minister Humphreys did however consult me about the\u00a0matter\u00a0and both of us\u00a0welcomed\u00a0 the acquisition of\u00a0the studios  to by a company which proposes to invest in the facility in the future.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s capital investment plan Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018- 2027 provides for funding of &euro;200m to be invested in media production and audio visual industries through the Irish Film Board over the next 10 years which will have a positive impact right across the country. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This will assist in realising the vision under Pillar 4 of the Creative Ireland Programme to develop Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production.\u00a0In the\u00a0coming period, the Government hopes to publish a Plan\u00a0for the Audiovisual Industry which will set out in greater detail how it is proposed to develop the industry further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300077#WRJ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta Data","counter":495,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300077#WRJ02200"},{"type":"question","counter":496,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[22778\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300077#WRJ02300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta jobs created per county in 2017, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":497,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the following table.<table><tr><th><div>County<\/div><\/th><th><div>New Jobs created in 2017 <\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>D&uacute;n na nGall<\/td><td>243<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Maigh Eo<\/td><td>60<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gaillimh<\/td><td>211<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>An Mh&iacute;<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ciarra&iacute;<\/td><td>64<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Corcaigh<\/td><td>34<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Port L&aacute;irge<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>630<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300077#WRJ02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"}]
