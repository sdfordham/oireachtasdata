The\u00a0EU Procurement Directives, transposed into Irish law in May 2016, contain provisions to make it easier for SMEs to tender for public procurement contracts.\u00a0 These include the following:<\/p>  <p>  - financial\u00a0capacity criterion is\u00a0less demanding and\u00a0generally limited to twice the contract value;<\/p>  <p>  - there\u00a0is discretion to divide public contracts into lots;<\/p>  <p>  - there\u00a0is a provision for \"consortia bidding\" to encourage SME\u00a0involvement; and<\/p>  <p>  - there are reductions in the time limits for receipt of tenders;<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, Government Policy as set out in Circular 10\/2014 updated and strengthened measures aimed at facilitating SME participation in Public Procurement.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister of State Eoghan Murphy TD, in accordance with the Programme for Government, chairs the SME Advisory Group which meets quarterly and seeks to enhance the measures already in place to support SME access.\u00a0 This group\u00a0comprises of\u00a0SME industry representative bodies (IBEC, ISME, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF)\u00a0as well as the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Inter-Trade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.\u00a0 This positive initiative shows a willingness to engage with and learn from private sector counterparts.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of assessing involvement of SMEs, data from the Public Service Spend\u00a0and Tendering Analysis Report for 2014, published by the OGP indicates that 95% of the analysed expenditure is with Irish based firms and the majority of\u00a0the spend\u00a0analysed is with SMEs.  In addition, the OGP conducted an analysis of the 122 Framework Agreements it has in place which\u00a0shows that 67% of Framework members are SMEs and 63% of the Frameworks had multiple lots, facilitating SME access.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Bill, you will be aware that it was not opposed by the Government in the D&aacute;il.\u00a0 However, care must be taken not to disproportionately impact on SME's bidding for public contracts. If a blanket suite of social benefit clauses was attached to all public procurement opportunities, it is likely that this would be ineffective, disproportionately favour larger enterprises, reduce competition in supplying goods and services to the State and drive up the costs. SMEs representative bodies have raised similar concerns.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Social clauses impose additional costs on both the State and suppliers in meeting their requirements and demonstrating and verifying compliance.\u00a0 In general, the inclusion of social clauses in a procurement process would appear to be most effective where the benefit could be considered a core requirement and can be directly linked to the contracting authority's policy or strategic plan.  The appropriateness of including social clauses in public procurement projects needs to be examined on contract by contract basis.\u00a0  There needs to be sufficient flexibility to allow each individual contracting authority to decide what, how and when social clauses can be used taking account of, for example, the economic environment and labour supply in a specific sector. <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, the reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.\u00a0 The OGP will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100055#WRA02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Service Pay Commission Reports","counter":27,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100055#WRA02500"},{"type":"question","counter":28,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[26045\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100055#WRA02600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when he expects to receive the report of the Public Service Pay Commission; his priorities in respect of restoration of pay levels in the public service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":29,"content":"<p>The initial Report of the Public Service Pay Commission was published on Tuesday, 9 May 2017.

Clearly this is a very serious decision but an essential element of our child protection system. <\/p>  <p>  While the report found that individual Garda&iacute; go to great efforts to treat children with sensitivity and compassion, it identified serious shortcomings in our child protection system and made a number of recommendations.  These include:<\/p>  <p>  - A new Garda Protocol to set out the circumstances in which section 12 may be used,<\/p>  <p>  - A set of Risk Principles to act as guidance in operational decision making by Garda&iacute;,<\/p>  <p>  - Data Capture\/Data sharing and review of data held on Pulse,<\/p>  <p>  - Specialised child protection units to be established in the Garda&iacute; &ndash; including having social workers assigned to these units,<\/p>  <p>  - Implementation of Children First Act to provide clear guidelines or co-operation between Garda&iacute; and other State Agencies,<\/p>  <p>  - Comprehensive training to be provided to Garda&iacute; reflecting law and international best practice, and<\/p>  <p>  - GRIDO (Garda Racial, Intercultural and Diversity Office) should be expanded and reviewed to ensure that positive work undertaken by the Office is relevant to all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

For my part I will certainly give whatever support I can to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in addressing these recommendations and also to the Garda Authorities in their work in putting in place the very necessary reform, policies and procedures to ensure that we can have confidence in our child protection system.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy might be aware, this morning I met with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs Ms. Katherine Zappone, T.D., to discuss the matter.

As the Deputy will also be aware, the Committee is examining the Garda Commissioner in relation to the Interim Audit Report and intends to resume that examination in the coming weeks, and will report subsequently.  The Garda Commissioner has been Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote since July 2006.  Very particular responsibilities lie with Accounting Officers under the law and you will appreciate that I must be careful not to interfere in any way with the work of that Committee. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the period prior to the Commissioner assuming the role of Accounting Officer, my officials have provided available information to the Committee.  The Deputy will appreciate that the period prior to the appointment of the Garda Commissioner as Accounting Officer relates to over 10 years ago and that the establishment of the company to which he refers dates back to the early 1990s, with consequent difficulties in establishing precise facts in relation to detailed aspects of this matter, particularly in the absence of relevant records. <\/p>  <p>  In all events, I am advised that no records have been found in the Department which relate to the matters referred to by the Deputy in relation  to the establishment of the Company in question. As previously stated, the Department became aware of certain issues in relation to Templemore in September 2015 having received representations from local TDs in relation to the desire of people to continue to have access to Templemore Golf Club.  Subsequently, in September 2016 the Department received the interim Internal Audit report which highlighted the issues around the lack of proper financial controls in operation in Templemore which are now being examined by the Committee.<\/p>  <p>  In the circumstances, I believe that the best course at this stage is to allow the examination by the PAC continue unhindered and can assure the Deputy that I will pay very careful attention to the proceedings at the Committee and, in particular, any report that it may make.  If action is required on my part as a result, I will not hesitate to take it.<\/p>  <p>  While, of course, there has to be accountability in relation to what went on at the College, the immediate priority has to be ensuring the problems identified in the audit are resolved.  I have been assured that the Garda Authorities recognise the gravity of the issues raised and that they are taking comprehensive steps to progress the recommendations in the Report.  External governance expertise and auditors have been engaged.  A Steering Committee, chaired by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Chief Administrative Officer and including a representative from my Department, is overseeing the implementation of the recommendations. In addition, upon receipt of the report I referred it to the Policing Authority to oversee the implementation of the recommendations and to report back to me each quarter.  I expect the Authority to submit its first report to me in July.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I am advised that the Commissioner has requested an  Assistant Commissioner to examine the Report with a view to establishing if there are any matters of discipline or criminality that need to be addressed and, if so, how such matters should be progressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100057#WRC05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tribunals of Inquiry Establishment","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100058#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[26517\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100058#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she or her Department was consulted regarding the creation of the Charleton liaison committee that was set up by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of the disclosures tribunal.","asker":"1349","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, I established the Disclosures Tribunal following the passing of Resolutions by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 16 February 2017. <\/p>  <p>  My Department was consulted by the Garda Commissioner in relation to the need to ensure that the Tribunal was appropriately serviced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with the least disruption to on-going operations.

Changes to these regulations would have to follow the normal EU approach starting with a proposal from the Commission before consideration by Member States and the European Parliament.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are matters within the SGP subject to the discretion of the European Commission.  The Commission regularly issues updated guidance on how\u00a0it will implement the SGP.  It is in this context that I sought and secured a major change from the Commission in achieving an annual update of the reference rate used in the expenditure benchmark. \u00a0The former practice had been to fix the reference rates for three years at a time.  This new approach significantly increases the permitted room for expenditure growth, which would not have been possible under the former practice. \u00a0In line with the principle of equal treatment for all Member States, the annual update of reference rates applied to all Member States.<\/p>  <p>  There are already in place specific provisions within the SGP designed to promote\u00a0capital investment.  For instance, within the expenditure benchmark, capital formation increases are smoothed over four years with the result that only one quarter of the increase in public investment must be funded in the first year from within the\u00a0fiscal space.  This provision, which means increases in capital spending for housing and other purposes can be front-loaded within the EU rules, has been utilised in Ireland's budgetary plans.  It should also be noted that the investment clause and the structural reform clause allow for temporary deviations from\u00a0the required structural\u00a0budgetary adjustment if spending on\u00a0capital investment can be shown to qualify for either of these clauses, which are subject to strict conditions.<\/p>  <p>  My approach to promoting additional investment has mainly involved securing additional EIB investment (off-balance sheet) and in this context, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform met with the EIB President last week to discuss, among other issues, how this could be moved forward.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The fiscal rules are designed to promote budgetary discipline and underpin sustainable economic growth.  While Ireland's economy is growing and debt is\u00a0on a downward trajectory, the\u00a0debt level is still comparably high and caution must be exercised due to the potential of rollover risk should interest rates increase.  We are a small and very open economy in a world that has more risks than usual. Compliance with\u00a0the fiscal rules underpins\u00a0the Government&rsquo;s objective of maintaining sound public finances.  The answer, therefore, is not simply about spending more; it is about\u00a0getting more from each euro of taxpayers' money that is spent.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100058#WRD03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Data","counter":172,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100058#WRD03500"},{"type":"question","counter":173,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[26402\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100058#WRD03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of whole life insurance policies in existence here; the average premium on such products; the average change in premiums at each review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":174,"content":"<p>It is not possible to provide the details sought by the Deputy. \u00a0The Central Statistics Office does not produce statistics on the price or price variance of whole-of-life insurance.\u00a0 Similarly, the Central Bank of Ireland does not collate any industry statistics on whole-of-life policies specifically, and neither does it collect any data in relation to average premium and average increase at each review. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Central Bank, that this type of plan is designed to provide consumers with life cover for their whole life.  As long as the policy holder makes regular payments and the payments are sufficient to maintain the chosen benefits, this type of cover will pay a lump sum on the death of the policy holder.<\/p>  <p>  The regular payment into the plan covers the cost of providing the benefits chosen on the plan.  In the early years the payments are higher than the cost of the policy holder&rsquo;s benefits.  The extra money paid goes into the plan fund. Protection benefits get more expensive as policy holders get older; usually as the plan progresses the payments begin to equal the cost of the chosen benefits.  In the later years of reviewable protection plans, the cost of the benefits increases significantly.  In order to keep the level of benefits at the current level of payments, the difference is made up from the plan fund.<\/p>  <p>  The insurance company carries out regular reviews (the period in which these are completed can be 5 years, 6 years, 10 or 12 years depending on the product) to see if the consumers\u00a0 regular payment plus any fund that has been built up is enough to cover their\u00a0 chosen benefits for their reviewable protection plan. \u00a0During a policy review the insurance company may find that the consumer&rsquo;s current level of payments is enough to maintain the level of cover that the consumer wants.  The insurance company may also find that the current level of payments is not enough to maintain the level of cover desired by the consumer.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I might conclude as\u00a0Minister for Finance, I\u00a0am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation. \u00a0Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.\u00a0 This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Consequently there is no role for my Department or the Central Bank in any post-sale reviews on whole-of-life policies.

Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is liable in respect of third party motor insurance claims made against the policyholders of Setanta Insurance. \u00a0The consequence of this is that the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) has been deemed responsible for the payment of such third party claims.<\/p>  <p>  Setanta Insurance was placed into\u00a0liquidation by the Malta Financial Services Authority in April 2014 and this\u00a0liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.\u00a0 The Liquidator has informed the Department that, as of 30 April 2017, the number of open claims was 1,639.\u00a0 It is now possible to begin the process of making payments of up to 65% (or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser) due to relevant third party claimants from the ICF.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is expected that a proportion of the balance of claims will be met from the proceeds of the distribution of Setanta&rsquo;s assets on completion of the liquidation process.  However, it is not possible to say definitively at this stage what proportion of the claims this will amount to, but current indications are that this is unlikely to be sufficient to cover all of the 35% gap.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014, a preliminary assessment was carried out by Towers Watson who indicated that the Liquidator would not be in a position to meet more than 30% of claims out of the assets of the liquidation.  The Liquidator has informed the Department that as the Supreme Court has now made its judgement, it will be necessary for a new report to be commissioned to provide updated figures.\u00a0 This is expected to commence shortly. <\/p>  <p>  The extent of the shortfall (i.e. the difference between the full amount due and the combined total of the ICF payment plus the Setanta distribution) is unlikely to become fully clear until the liquidator has determined the remaining monies in Setanta that he has to distribute\u00a0to policyholders. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to the issue as to when payments can be expected to commence, it should be noted that Department of Finance officials have had discussions with the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice and the State Claims Agency and they have\u00a0indicated that they have plans in place to deal with this issue.\u00a0 Our understanding is that both agencies are working with the Liquidator to plan out the process of validation and presentation of claims.  Once the liquidator has the claims ready for examination, the State Claims Agency will step in to commence the validation process.  The State Claims Agency has assured the Department that it will act swiftly so that there will be no unnecessary delay caused by this validation process.  I hope to have greater clarity on the timescale shortly.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware the forthcoming legislation based on the recommendations of the\u00a0Review of the Framework for Motor Insurance Compensation in Ireland\u00a0will amend the relevant Insurance Acts to ensure 100% of third party motor claims will be covered in future by the ICF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100058#WRD06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Data","counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100059#WRE00300"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[26498\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100059#WRE00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons that requested a P21 balancing statement from the Revenue Commissioners; the refunds issued to persons and additional tax collected from persons as a result in each of the years 2010 to 2016 in aggregate form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers. <\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. <\/p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for\u00a0public servants\u00a0to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers. \u00a0The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.\u00a0 This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.\u00a0 Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all.\u00a0 It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.<\/p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system. Teachers are not paid equally. For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching. Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods. <\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector. A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the recently published analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve. However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of public service pay talks.\u00a0 My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, invited the Public Services Committee of ICTU to discussions on public service pay and a continued approach to the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation and these discussions are now underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100059#WRE04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100059#WRE04400"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[26358\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100059#WRE04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to the forum on entrepreneurship in schools held by his Department on 10 September 2015 and having regard to action point 107 objective 4.6 on entrepreneurship education in the action plan for education 2017, the steps taken to date;

The Board of CIB is committed to supporting the long term delivery of services at a local level and there may be opportunities to extend or improve existing service delivery over time.  However, in so doing CIB is obliged to ensure that it and its service delivery partners comply with standards as set out in the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies and ensure that Comptroller and Auditor General requirements are met.  This is the context in which the Board has made its decision to reorganise the governance arrangements of local CIS and MABS companies.  I accept the bona fides of the Board in its decision.  <\/p>  <p>  Before making its final decision, CIB had engaged in an extensive and comprehensive consultation process, involving service delivery companies and representative organisations and groups.  This process included representative groups having audiences with the CIB Board itself.  <\/p>  <p>In recent months, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection held hearings and received submissions from the various stakeholders.  Cognisant of the various concerns expressed to the Committee, CIB undertook a series of regional consultations with stakeholders throughout the month of May, to discuss and examine   key aspects of implementing the new sixteen board model.  These sessions were attended by 127 representatives of local company Boards and 223 representatives of management, staff and volunteers of local services.  Each session was chaired by an independent facilitator.  All who attended had an opportunity to raise any concerns they had about service delivery under the new model.  CIB reports that these engagements were well received and there was considerable support for the change.<\/p>  <p>  My Department understands that CIB intends to host further consultations over the summer period, on key areas such as the role of volunteers, the delivery of consistent high quality services countrywide and the preservation of the fundamentally valuable local community focus and support ethos within the new model.  CIB will consider these findings in the development of its Volunteer Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  CIB has established an Implementation Group, with   cross-sectoral representation, to assist with the governance reorganisation.  CIB has also committed to carry out a full Cost Benefit Analysis on the sixteen company model.  <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that CIB is making genuine efforts to allay the concerns of staff, boards and volunteers and is actively seeking to find ways to best embed the historically strong community ethos in the new governance structure for CIS and MABS services.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100060#WRF03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance","counter":289,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100060#WRF03700"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[26337\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100060#WRF03800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason the waiting list for domiciliary care allowance applicants is 14 weeks or more; his plans to improve this waiting time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1220","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":291,"content":"<p>Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) claims that require medical and other supporting documentation can take some time to properly assess, particularly as the opinion of one of the department&rsquo;s medical assessor&rsquo;s is routinely required.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing numbers applying for DCA have been a feature of this scheme in recent years.

These documents were published in 2015 and are available on my Department's website.<\/p>  <p>  Officials at my Department are currently in the process of preparing a successor to the Public Service Reform Plan which is intended to cover the period up to 2020.  I expect that alternative models of service delivery, including the option to outsource services in appropriate circumstances, will feature as a\u00a0mechanism that is available to public service managers to allow them to innovate and deliver the most cost-effective services to the citizen. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I wish to stress that decisions to outsource\u00a0functions are reached on a case-by-case basis by the organisation that manages the service in question. \u00a0The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s role is to support public service bodies in exploring all service delivery options that are available to them and to ensure\u00a0evidence-informed decisions are made when selecting a delivery model.

This resulted in Ireland successfully leaving the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support in December 2013 and exiting the Excessive Deficit Procedure at the end of 2015.  Government Departments played a key role in ensuring that public services were delivered effectively during a period when significant fiscal consolidation was required to put the public finances on a sound footing. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  2015 marked the turning point where expenditure reductions were no longer required to meet our fiscal targets.  An amount of &euro;58.1 billion has been allocated to gross voted expenditure in 2017 bringing the annual average growth rate in expenditure to c.3 per cent over the period 2015 to 2017.  The expenditure increases over this three year period have provided for additional spending on key public services and on social and economic infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  As the Government looks to continue with its policy of providing for prudent and sustainable increases in expenditure, once account is taken of calls on expenditure relating to demographics, the Public Capital Plan and the Lansdowne Road Agreement, there are limited resources remaining to address a variety of competing demands.  In this context the Spending Review currently underway will support prudent fiscal management and assist with prioritising between policy initiatives to ensure resources are allocated to areas where they can have the greatest impact in terms of social and economic gain.<\/p>  <p>  Looking at pay in the public and private sector, data released by the CSO recently highlighted modest growth in private sector average weekly earnings in the year to 2017. \u00a0The Government Expenditure Ceiling for 2018 includes a provision of &euro;0.3 billion relating to pay commitments arising under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  As the Deputy will be aware, negotiations are currently taking place with the Public Service Unions on a successor to the Lansdowne Road Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, managing the delivery of public services within Budgetary allocations is\u00a0a key responsibility of each Minister and their Department, and important\u00a0measures are in place to help ensure that these budgetary targets continue to be met.\u00a0 My Department is in regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters.  The\u00a0drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles. \u00a0There is regular reporting to Government on these matters, and\u00a0information is published monthly, as part of the Exchequer Statement. Gross voted expenditure of &euro;17,849 million to end-April was &euro;282 million (1.6%) below profile, with gross voted current expenditure &euro;247 million (1.4%) below profile and gross voted capital expenditure &euro;35 million (3.6%) below profile. <\/p>  <p>  A new phase of public service reform, to cover the period 2017-2020, is currently being developed and last September I invited the members of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach to input to this process.\u00a0 This new phase will place the customer's needs at the core of every decision from policy formulation to service design through to the service delivery.  It will set out a series of actions to be delivered out to 2020 which will both build on the achievements of the last six years and respond to new challenges. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100061#WRG03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":349,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100061#WRG04100"},{"type":"question","counter":350,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[26371\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100061#WRG04200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the degree to which his Department monitors the impact of Brexit on the public and private sectors with a view to addressing such issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":351,"content":"<p>Brexit issues in my Department are coordinated centrally by the Department's Brexit\/EU\/North South Unit.\u00a0 The Unit oversees Brexit work across the Department and acts as the contact point with the Department of the Taoiseach and other Government Departments.\u00a0 It is represented on the Inter-Departmental Group on Brexit and related groups, and supports me in my work as a member of the Cabinet Committee on Brexit.\u00a0 Brexit issues are also addressed by staff in relevant areas across the Department.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly Brexit will pose significant challenges right across the economy.\u00a0 The Government is committed to addressing these challenges, to mitigating the impacts and to maximising the available opportunities.\u00a0 The Government is using a highly consultative approach &ndash; through the All-Island Civic Dialogue Process and other stakeholder events &ndash; and this will continue as the process moves into the negotiations stage.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In the short term, the Minister for Finance and I were able to deliver a Budget for 2017 setting out our approach to Brexit and to building a national economic response.\u00a0\u00a0For the third year in succession it has been possible to increase resources for public services and infrastructure.\u00a0 The gross voted expenditure allocation of &euro;58.1 billion in 2017 will be over 3 per cent higher than the 2016 allocation.\u00a0 Resources have been allocated towards areas that may be significantly impacted by Brexit, in particular enterprises dealing with the impact of Brexit and our regional and rural communities.<\/p>  <p>  In the longer term, the design of this year's Spending Review reflects the changed economic and fiscal context, including Brexit.\u00a0 Of course, while moderate and sustainable expenditure growth is planned over the medium-term, increasing and competing public service demands will mean managing expenditure will prove challenging. <\/p>  <p>  The Capital Plan Building on Recovery sets out a &euro;42 billion framework to address our priority infrastructure needs up to 2021.\u00a0\u00a0Government has already committed to increase capital expenditure under the plan by &euro;5.14\u00a0billion in the 2016 Summer Economic Statement (SES).

The hospital will be a world class facility to care for children and young people from all over Ireland who are in need of specialist and complex care and, with two outpatient and urgent care centres, will also be the local children's hospital for children and young people in the Greater Dublin area.  These two outpatient and urgent care centres, being developed on the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals, are an integral part of the children's hospital, and will be supported by the hospital in providing urgent care and outpatient services, including general paediatric rapid access outpatient clinics, orthopaedic outpatient fracture clinics and other chronic disease clinics.  The centres will improve geographic access to urgent care for children in the Greater Dublin Area as well as further afield.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to access to the children's hospital at the St James's campus, while noting that the campus is better served by public transport than any other hospital in the country, the plans and design for the hospital recognise the need of most families to access the hospital by car.  A traffic management and traffic mobility plan for the hospital, endorsed by the National Transport Authority and Dublin City Council, formed part of the planning application.  A 10-day oral hearing took place in December 2015 in which traffic evidence was presented in detail and allowed for cross questioning by those who had concerns.  Planning approval for the hospital was granted without change to the proposed traffic and mobility plan.  The plans for the hospital provide for 1,000 car parking spaces, of which 675 will be dedicated for use by families, three times the number of spaces currently available at the three Dublin children's hospitals combined.  Parents will be able to reserve their space ahead of arriving at the hospital, and emergency drop-off spaces are also being provided. <\/p>  <p>  Incorporating leading practice in children's hospital design, children and young people who need to stay in hospital will have their own single room.  Every room, with the exception of critical care rooms, will have an en-suite bathroom and facilities for a parent to comfortably stay overnight.  The development of a new 53-bed family accommodation, to be built adjacent to the new children&rsquo;s hospital, was also included in the new children&rsquo;s hospital planning permission.<\/p>  <p>  A national model of care for paediatric healthcare services in Ireland has been developed by the HSE.  The model aims to ensure that all children should be able to access high quality services in an appropriate location, within an appropriate timeframe, irrespective of their geographical location or social background.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital will engage in shared care arrangements and outreach to support regional paediatric units in Cork, Limerick and Galway, and in turn local hospitals, thereby providing clinically appropriate healthcare for children as close to home as possible.  With the new children&rsquo;s hospital as the future hub, the initial focus in the implementation of the model of care will be on developing the regional units to provide an appropriate range of regional services to minimise the need for children and families to travel to Dublin for services. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100063#WRJ04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Staff Data","counter":459,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100063#WRJ04200"},{"type":"question","counter":460,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[26455\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100063#WRJ04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of trips taken by each hospital in 2015 and in 2016 to recruit nurses;

prices.  The value of land is of course governed by the laws of supply and demand and for those selling land this is, of course, a positive development.  There are many reasons why lands are put up for sale which can include lands which are viewed as marginal for agriculture or indeed the restructuring of farm holdings following retirement, death or inheritance.  There are also regional variations in terms of demand, supply and quality which influences the final price paid for land. Forestry may be one of many factors which can influence movements in land prices.<\/p>  <p>  The market for farmland in Ireland is characterised by a low volume of land sales with relatively high prices and this is attributable to a number of factors, both social and economic.  CSO data shows prices vary across regions and by land type.  The recent Agri-taxation Review acknowledged that access to land is an issue and identified as a key policy objective to increase the mobility and the productive use of land.  A number of measures to rebalance the rental sector in favour of long-term leasing have been introduced in recent years and are having a significant impact, especially among younger farmers and those seeking to expand.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The perceived link between afforestation grants, premium rates and movement in land prices overlooks the complexity that exists within the land market.  The investor portion of new planting is not significant although it is increasing.  For farmers, forestry offers a viable alternative enterprise which allows them to diversify their income stream away from volatile agricultural markets and towards the more stable timber market and for this reason the supports offered by the State are very much welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  Access to finance is a priority issue and earlier this year I introduced the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo;.

Addressing the most recent Forum, I took the opportunity to highlight that one of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers. <\/p><p>Therefore I was pleased to facilitate the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo;, which was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and makes &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%.  Distributed through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, it provides tillage farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.  The loans are for amounts up to &euro;150,000 for up to six years and are flexible with interest only facilities of up to three years.\u00a0 Although no official returns have been made to my Department as yet, preliminary information from the SBCI shows that some 8% of the loans to date have been drawn down by the tillage sector.  The banks have confirmed that they have applications up to the amounts available under the Scheme. <\/p><p>There may be some residual availability but this will only emerge as applications are processed and loans drawn down.  I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance. <\/p><p>I have met with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other issues relating to\u00a0access to finance in the agri-food sector.  I have asked the banks to respond positively to this demand by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future. Implementation of this Scheme is subject to the provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408\/2013 (de minimis aid in the agricultural production sector).  Support provided under the de minimis regulation complies with State Aid rules in the agriculture sector and does not require prior approval by the EU Commission.<\/p><p>Specifically in referring\u00a0to Council Regulation No. 1305\/2013\u00a0relating to the funding of EU rural development programming 2014 &ndash; 2020, support under this regulation refers to damage caused by adverse climatic events and is directed towards restoration of the production potential of lands affected, rather than support for specific losses.<\/p><p>However, under this regulation,\u00a0I introduced the Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II which\u00a0opened for online applications on the 8 March 2017.  The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.  This Tillage Scheme is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  The Scheme is co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). All applications must be made on-line, either by the farmer or by an adviser authorised to act on his or her behalf.\u00a0 The closing date for applications under the first tranche of the new scheme will be Friday 30 June 2017.\u00a0 <\/p><p>As an additional support to\u00a0cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, up to &euro;1.186 billion has been paid out under the Basic Payment Scheme to 124,112 farmers\u00a0with payments\u00a0ongoing.

The RAC agreed to maintain the existing harmonised classification of glyphosate as a substance causing serious eye damage and being toxic to aquatic life with long-lasting effects.

This is underpinned by the Energy White Paper which sets out a framework that will guide policy in the energy sector\u00a0from now up to 2030. It sets a\u00a0vision of reducing emissions from the energy system by 80-95% by 2050.\u00a0 This will require the share of fossil fuels to be of the order of 26-51% of total primary energy requirement.

Once the analysis is complete, my Department will publish a final public consultation on the design of the new support scheme.\u00a0 There\u00a0will be several\u00a0decisions to be made with regard to scale, technologies and, in particular, how communities will have a greater involvement than in previous schemes. <\/p>  <p>  Subject to securing the necessary approvals, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in the first half of 2018<\/p>  <p>  Looking to the European Union's emerging climate and energy targets for 2030, it is likely that all Member States will be required\u00a0to expand their renewable electricity generation portfolios beyond their 2020 capacities.<\/p>  <p>  As acknowledged in the Energy White Paper, oil and natural gas will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in the course of the transition.

A JLC is comprised of equal numbers of representatives of employers and workers in a sector.\u00a0 JLCs meet regularly, under an independent Chairperson to discuss proposals for terms and conditions to apply to specified grades or categories of workers in the sector.

Such Orders are known as Employment Regulation Orders. <\/p>  <p>  The Joint Labour Committee for the Security Industry was established in accordance with Statutory Instrument No. 377 of 1998 (as amended by Statutory Instrument No. 30 of 2014).

The strategy was developed in the context of Brexit and focuses on supporting clients to both Build Scale and Expand Reach.  In addition, in May 2017 Enterprise Ireland launched a new Eurozone Strategy to assist Irish exporters increase exports in Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020.  This strategy will be accompanied by a new &lsquo;Irish Advantage&rsquo; campaign which will target Eurozone buyers to promote Irish innovation in key Brexit impacted sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Eurozone markets can provide currency stability, proximity and potential for growth and opportunities for Irish companies.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Eurozone Strategy will see the agency partnering with some 600 client companies, approximately half of which are &lsquo;Eurozone Start&rsquo; (relatively new to the market and who are heavily reliant on the UK) while the remainder are &lsquo;Eurozone Scale&rsquo; (already exporting to the Eurozone).<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the market diversification drive characterised by the new Eurozone Strategy, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus continues to be on supporting companies on a one to one and on a sector by sector basis to enhance their competitiveness and capability and build on their success in existing and new markets.  To this end, on 31 March Enterprise Ireland launched its &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo;, a new interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars - Business Strategy, Operations, Innovation, Sales and Marketing, Finance and People Management. \u00a0Based on answers supplied by the user, the Scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions and resources, and information on events for companies to attend, to prepare for Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has also launched a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; that supports the costs of SME clients in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit.

These initiatives will again involve the organisation of, participation in, or support of a wide range of agriculture related events such as the FTMTAMachinery Show, Assisting in KTGFacilitator Training, Farmer of the Year Awards, Farm Safety Months, (March\/Livestock, May\/Tractors&amp;amp; Machinery, November\/Falls from Height &amp;amp; Falling Objects) , Teagasc Dairy Event, the Tullamore Show, the National Ploughing Championships and again some other minor events all with media coverage or campaigns. <\/p><p>The funding allocations that the HSA makes for particular aspects of its annual programme of work, including farm safety initiatives, can fluctuate from year to year as the HSA decides how to prioritise its non-pay funding in order to implement its overall programme of work. <\/p><p>The totality of the work of the HSA in relation to farm safety is not confined to specific farm safety initiatives or formal inspections.  In addition to such initiatives visits to farms by inspectors include routine unannounced inspections to monitor compliance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 and with other health and safety regulations and to investigate fatal and serious farm accidents.  Typically in any one year there can be between 60 &ndash; 90 investigations on farms with the rest being unannounced inspections. In 2017 the HSA is carrying out three focused\u00a0farm campaigns each of one month duration.  The first focused on &ldquo;animal handling&rdquo;, the second on working with &ldquo;machinery&rdquo; and the third on &ldquo;working from heights&rdquo;. <\/p><p>Since 2014 the HSA has redirected some of its inspection resources to engaging directly with farmers on other accident prevention initiatives. \u00a0This approach continues in 2017 particularly through the Knowledge Transfer Groups of which 42 have been attended so far this year and all facilitators of knowledge transfer groups have now been trained in occupational health and safety by Teagasc and the HSA. <\/p><p>The priority tasks for the HSA in relation to engagement with the farming sector for 2017 include:<\/p><p>- ongoing delivery of the Farm Safety Partnership Action Plan, 2016 to 2018;<\/p><p>- continuing awareness campaigns through the media, events and advertising targeted at agricultural sector;<\/p><p>- promotion of good health for farmers;<\/p><p>- publication of information sheets;<\/p><p>- roll out of the revised Code of Practice on farm safety;<\/p><p>- finalising an e-learning tool on tractor and machinery safety,<\/p><p>- focusing on child safety on farms through programmes at primary and post-primary school level, letters have already issued to over 3,000 such schools;<\/p><p>- increasing awareness of farm safety throughout the sector.<\/p><p>I, of course, remain very concerned at the ongoing high level of farm fatalities. Since the start of this year there have been 12 people killed on farms, with 8 deaths\u00a0of farmers over 70 years of age.  Indeed myself and my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Michael Creed TD, invited leading stakeholders involved in the agriculture sector, including representatives from four (4) major farming organisations (IFA, ICMSA,  Macra na Feirme and ICSA) to a round table meeting on farm safety.  The meeting facilitated a full and frank discussion on practical targeted actions that could be taken at a number of levels.  I have asked all participants to formally submit their suggestions and proposals on actions that can be taken at Government and sectoral level and all will be given detailed consideration.<\/p><p>Farm Tractor &amp;amp; Machinery Trade Association<\/p><p>Knowledge Transfer Group<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100066#WRM04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health and Safety Authority Expenditure","counter":635,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100066#WRM04300"},{"type":"question","counter":636,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[26409\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100066#WRM04400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the amount the Health and Safety Authority spent on all safety initiatives; the number of inspections it carried out in each of the years 2010 to 2016, and to date in 2017, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":637,"content":"<p>Details on the number of inspections and investigations and spend on safety initiatives by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) for the period 2010 - 2017 is as follows:<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Inspections and Investigations<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>16,714<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>15,340<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>13,835<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>12,244<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>10,719<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>10,880<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>10,460<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>4,075 recorded year to date 25 May 2017<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Spend on Safety Initiatives<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>&euro;2.01m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>&euro;1.567m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>&euro;1.907m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>&euro;1.595m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>&euro;1.154m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>&euro;1.776m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>&euro;1.297 m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>&euro;360,000 estimated year to date of &euro;1.53m proposed<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Health and Safety Authority Inspectors carry out inspections across all work sectors and work activities that come under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and the Chemicals Act 2008.

For children under three years of age, maximum subsidy rates &ndash; for families with the lowest incomes &ndash; will be &euro;4.18 per hour for 2 year olds, &euro;4.37 per hour for 1 year olds and &euro;5.11 per hour for children between 6 and 12 months . These maximum subsidy rates will apply to families with net incomes below &euro;22,700. For families with net incomes between &euro;22,700 and &euro;47,500, the hourly subsidy rate will taper down evenly from the maximum subsidy rates to the minimum subsidy rate of &euro;0.50 per hour.<\/p>  <p>  The ECCE capitation rates are &euro;64.50 per week for the standard capitation and &euro;75 per week for the higher capitation.

In addition, the difference in rates between the schemes reflects the different adult-child ratios that are required depending on the age of the child and the type of session (e.g. whether sessional or full-time\/part-time).  Unlike in the ECCE programme, it is not proposed that ACS subsidy-rates will vary according to the qualification levels of childcare workers, though the link between the cost of delivery and qualification levels will be further examined in the context of the forthcoming independent review of the cost of quality childcare. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100067#WRN04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Years Sector","counter":692,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100067#WRN04200"},{"type":"question","counter":693,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[26348\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100067#WRN04300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when the under three years of age subgroup of the early years forum will produce their recommendations to support and sustain provision for children under 3 in ECCE; and when this information will be readily available for consideration.","asker":"1266","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":694,"content":"<p>I am aware that the 0-3 age group presents particular issues for early years service providers.

It is a valuable report and raises a number of issues that are of concern to us all.   <\/p>  <p>  Dr. Shannon's report refers to a number of case studies based in Garda records. I have asked Tusla to obtain the information on these cases and review them against their records so that we may have a fuller picture of events.  I understand that a report based on these cases is expected to be available for my information in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  A protocol between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla-Child and Family Agency is near completion and, shortly, a Tusla social worker will be co-located with the national child protection unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Liaison will be in place between Tusla and newly established Garda divisional child protection units.  I understand that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla already have excellent co-operation at senior management levels.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2015, Tusla launched a consolidated national out of hours service, to improve on previous arrangements.  I understand this was after the period reviewed by Dr. Shannon.  All Garda&iacute; who  contact Tusla under this arrangement will speak with a social worker in a dedicated unit in Tusla's national office.  This office  may provide advice or in the busiest areas  make arrangements to deliver a child to Tusla following the invocation of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991.  Garda&iacute; also have limited access, for data protection reasons, to the Child Protection Notification System to identify if a child is subject to a child protection plan.  There are social workers available to be on the ground in Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Cork city, where demand is greatest, and an on-call social worker service across the areas where an out of hours request is not as frequent.  Tusla has indicated that it is monitoring these arrangements and will report to me when they complete their review.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the powers under section 12 of the Act can only be invoked by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under certain circumstances and Garda&iacute; must then take steps to deliver a child to Tusla once the child has been removed.  Tusla is then obliged under the Act to either reunite the child with a responsible caregiver or to seek an emergency care order in the Courts.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100068#WRO00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":715,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100068#WRO00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Data","counter":714,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100068#WRO00500"},{"type":"question","counter":715,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[26283\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017060100068#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the expenses incurred by his Department relating to insurance of all types in each of the past five years; the cost of each insurance policy held by his Department over the same time period per annum; if he will provide the same data for all bodies under the aegis of his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":716,"content":"<p>Apart from Civil Defence, all other elements of the Defence Organisation are covered under State indemnity through the State Claims Agency and therefore do not require commercial insurance.
