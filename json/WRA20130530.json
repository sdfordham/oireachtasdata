In all over 550 Irish cultural projects and events were supported in over 50 countries, ranging across music, theatre, dance, literature, film, visual art and architecture. This included significant projects such as a major international tour of DruidMurphy in the USA and England which culminated in the Director winning Best Director at the UK Theatre Awards<\/p><p><br \/>  As Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht I led two of our largest and most important trade missions in 2012 -<\/p><p> - the Association of Performing Arts Presenters Conference [APAP], in New York, in January, a key target market for Irish artists which is of strategic importance in the development of US Irish cultural relations, and<\/p><p> - the performing arts showcase at the Edinburgh Festivals in August, an annual showcase which has proved a key platform for Irish performing artists and writers to present their work to international audiences as well as festival and venue promoters and programmers. <\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore, the Division, in partnership with the Arts Council, supported Ireland's participation in the Venice Architecture Biennale, the foremost platform for international showcasing of architecture.  In January of this year, the Division supported a delegation of key theatre, dance and music practitioners to attend APAP 2013 in New York, as part of an Irish Government trade and promotional mission for the performing arts.  The Irish artists who presented work in New York have reported strong future tour bookings for 2013\/2014 as a result.<\/p><p><br \/>  The International element of <i>Culture Connects<\/i>, the Culture Programme to mark Ireland's Presidency of the Council of European Union during the first 6 months of 2013, funded by the Culture Ireland Division of my Department has focused on Member States and priority countries, including Russia, Australia and China.  The programme covers all art forms and provides a key platform to highlight the strength of Ireland's creative and artistic sector. Highlights of the Culture Programme include the opening concert in Brussels by The Gloaming, the Irish Chamber Orchestra in Berlin, the Eileen Gray exhibition in Centre Pompidou, Paris and the <i>Changing States<\/i> exhibition of Frances Bacon and contemporary artists in the Bozar Art Gallery in Brussels. Audience attendance has been strong and feedback and media coverage on Ireland's Culture Programme has been very positive.  In Berlin, for example, there were more than 1,200 attendees at the opening concert, visitor numbers to the <i>Changing States<\/i> art exhibition in Brussels have exceeded 8,000 and Centre Pompidou will attract approx 500,000 visitors during the period of the Eileen Gray exhibition. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department continues to support Irish artists in presenting work at strategic international festivals, venues and showcases, building touring networks and contacts. Just last week I announced the results of the most recent grant round, allocating funding of over &euro;470,000 to Irish artists and organisations to present Irish arts abroad during the remainder of 2013 and early 2014. The Culture Ireland Division also continues to work on a cross-agency basis on key initiatives of joint interest. Over the 2013 St Patrick's Day period, for example, it supported more than 60 events across Europe, the US, China, Russia and Australia. <\/p><p><br \/>  I am satisfied that my Department's international promotion of Irish arts has created significant goodwill and influence for Ireland and has helped to contribute to the strength of Ireland's reputation for creative excellence.

A range of the actions being taken to support The Gathering were outlined in my replies to Questions No. 16 of 28 November 2012, No. 13 of 30 January 2013 and No. 120 of 13 March 2013. The national cultural institutions are involved and have identified specific exhibitions and initiatives to focus on maximising a positive impression of the country internationally.    <\/p><p>  Culture Ireland is the Division of my Department responsible for the promotion of Irish arts worldwide. Through regular grant rounds, showcases and special initiatives it creates and supports opportunities for Irish artists and companies to present and promote their work at strategic international festivals and venues. Culture Ireland has included as a grant condition for 2013 events that grantees when presenting their work should promote The Gathering and encourage their audiences to embrace the initiative.<\/p><p>  In addition, the thousands of arts events at festivals and elsewhere funded by the Arts Council are at the heart of The Gathering. While the primary purpose of Arts Council grants is to promote the arts, the Arts Council has long recognised the immense value of the events its funds to our tourism &lsquo;offer&rsquo;. The weather in Ireland can be unreliable, so it is vital that visitors have the option of experiencing the best of Irish contemporary culture &ndash; indeed, that is frequently why they come to our shores. Each event in The Gathering centres on a different and unique community in Ireland, and the arts are often what creates that distinctive sense of place. Senior officials at the Arts Council met with The Gathering last year to discuss how Arts Council events could best compliment the initiative.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that Arts Council funding decisions are made independently of my influence, but I understand that a great number of arts organisations funded by the Arts Council are participating in The Gathering. This is particularly the case with festivals. In addition to major arts festivals such as the Galway Arts Festival, Kilkenny Arts Festival or Cork Midsummer Festival, and the many important festivals relating to a single art form, such as Listowel Writers&rsquo; Week or Wexford Festival Opera, the Arts Council will this year invest some &euro;8811,00 in 160 smaller festivals right around the country.<\/p><p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta developed a dedicated scheme to support events &amp;amp; festivals in the Gaeltacht as part of the 2013 Gathering initiative. The scheme placed particular emphasis on activities aimed at attracting visitors to Ireland as part of the Gathering.  As previously outlined, various initiatives are also underway in the heritage area.  <\/p><p>  I consider that my Department and its agencies are making a substantive contribution to The Gathering Initiative which will promote a positive image of the country internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000055#WRA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000055#WRA01650"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[26127\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000055#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"his plans to amend the Official Languages Act 2003; and if he will outline these plans to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":25,"content":"<p>Preparatory work in this regard is currently underway in my Department with a view to bringing the relevant draft Heads of Bill to Government as soon as possible.

I place great importance on public engagement and participation at community level.  There is a strengthening interest in this important period of our history which I believe will continue to grow in the coming years.  I have made a priority commitment to facilitating exploration and discussion of the revolutionary period through the preparation of archives for public release and the production of a new online newspaper of contemporary reporting - <i>Century Ireland<\/i>  - to build affinity with the issues and people of a hundred years ago.<\/p><p><br \/>  The costs arising from official elements of the commemoration programme are largely being met from the existing resources allocated to the national cultural institutions and other bodies, complemented by the work of other Departments.  Commemorative arrangements are also being developed through co-operation between the National Cultural Institutions, the Trade Unions, academic bodies, community and voluntary partners, most especially this year in relation to the 1913 Lockout.<\/p><p><br \/>  The comprehensive programme for the Lockout has been primarily brought forward by a 1913 Commemoration Committee under the auspices of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It includes a collaborative commemorative tapestry project, an oral history project, exhibitions, conferences, seminars, memorial church services, re-enactments and a schools programme developed in association with the National Cultural Institutions, academic bodies, community and voluntary partners. Recognising the centenary of the Lockout, the 'One City, One Book' programme of Dublin City Council has selected '<i>Strumpet City<\/i>  ' for 1913.  Special commemorative stamps will be issued by An Post this year for The Lockout.<\/p><p><br \/>  Without a substantial and dedicated fund to support commemorations, my Department seeks to provide assistance through accommodation, use of services and other supports. The National Museum will soon host an exhibition of the banners of the labour movement.  The National Library will host a major exhibition in August entitled &#8220;Lockout!&#8221;, which will provide access to historical documents of the time.  My Department has provided support for the 1913 tapestry project, which is being developed by a large group of volunteers under the supervision of the National College of Art and Design and artists Robert Ballagh and Cathy Henderson.<\/p><p><br \/>  Special arrangements are also being made this year for the Centenary of the Irish Volunteers.  Plans for events to take place in November are being prepared in partnership with the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces and will be announced shortly.<\/p><p><br \/>  Insofar as funding can be provided this year by the Government to support commemorations, I believe priority should attach to a small number of capital projects that are under consideration in order that they might be completed in advance of the centenary of the Easter Rising.  Project approval and the allocation of funding for these projects will be announced on an individual basis.  I have approved financial support of approximately &euro;150,00 Centenary commemorative projects in 2013.  These allocations relate in the main to the recently launched Century Ireland and the 1916 Oral History projects. Subject to availability of resources within the approved Estimate for my Department, I hope to make some further allocations later this year.<\/p><p><br \/>  Although the commemorative programme embraces the totality of our history in the years from the 3rd Home Rule Bill to the emergence of the Irish State, I am conscious of the particular interest in the Easter Rising and the Proclamation of the Republic and how these events might be commemorated.  I had a welcome opportunity to discuss these issues with Senators last week.  I indicated that I was interested to look beyond the ceremonial arrangements that will mark the anniversaries and that we should direct attention now towards initiatives that would enhance our understanding of the background, the principles and the vision of the revolutionary movement.  In particular, I invited Senators to consider how we might explore the revolutionary age through its artistic legacy and how the arts might today give expression to our perspective on the Rising after the passing of a hundred years.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Advisory Group on Commemorations has recently commenced a national consultation process with regard to expectations and arrangements.  Following an initial meeting in Carlow, meetings are now being arranged to take place in Cork and Kerry.  These meetings are arranged in partnership with the local authority and promoted through local media and the network of local history societies.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am aware of the limited time remaining to 2016 and the desirability that all arrangements would soon be in place for the special initiatives relating to the Centenary of the Rising.  The commemorative framework will be underpinned by official ceremonies and the continuing and special exhibitions by the national cultural institutions - particularly the digitisation and release of archival material, most especially the records of the Military Service Pensions Archive.  With the official contribution substantially defined, I am keen next to engage with local authorities, universities and community groups in Ireland and abroad on their contributions and participation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000056#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Training","counter":31,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000056#WRB00450"},{"type":"question","counter":32,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[26096\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000056#WRB00500","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will give a detailed account of the amount of money spent by his Department in 2012 and in the year to date in 2013 on training and development in arts and heritage; if he will provide specific details of the way the money was spent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1037","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":33,"content":"<p>My Department does not directly provide training or development for people working in the arts or heritage sectors.

The arts sector continue to offer vital opportunities for the provision of important cultural, social and employment benefits to communities throughout the country.

This Charter places new responsibilities on Government Departments, agencies, cultural institutions and arts organisations in terms of providing and promoting arts education to children and young people.  This Charter has been agreed by both Ministers.  Minister Quinn and I believe passionately in arts education and want to see a joined-up Government approach across Departments, education agencies and arts organisations. The charter will see organisations like the Arts Council, the National Cultural Institutions, the Colleges of Education and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment working with both Departments in order to bring the arts into the classroom and learners into the institutes for the arts.<\/p><p><br \/>  A High Level Implementation Group was established to oversee the implementation of the Art in Education Charter earlier in the year and it will report twice a year.  The Implementation Group is chaired by Professor John Coolahan, Professor Emeritus, NUI Maynooth.  It membership includes Orlaith McBride, Director of the Arts Council, Mary Nunan, Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, University of Limerick, Alan Wall Director, Department of Education and Skills and Niall O Donnch&uacute;, Assistant Secretary, Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Group has met on a number of occasions and has been proactive in meeting organisations from both the arts and education sectors.  Progress is being made on a number of initiatives including developing a website \/ portal as a key communications and information channel for both the education and arts sectors.  Suitable models for Art Rich Schools and for artists become involved in the programme are also being examined by the Arts Council and this Group.<\/p><p><br \/>  There is no specific funding provision in my Department's Vote for arts in education this year.  However, the Deputies may be aware that in May 2012 I announced the introduction of a new philanthropic initiative on a pilot basis for arts and culture organisations.  The initiative - the <i>Philanthropic Leverage Initiative <\/i>- was designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment of the arts from private sources. The initiative, established in 2012 provides an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new funding relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts.  The initiative proved very successful with a multiplier of 4.26 in philanthropic donations being leveraged for the arts.  The arts got a boost of over &euro;1 million last year, of which less than one-fifth came from the public purse.<\/p><p><br \/>  This year, &euro;210,000 will be available to arts organisations under the scheme and the majority of the Philanthropy Initiative funding will be directed towards arts and culture organisations seeking support for projects that include an education component.  The application form includes a provision that in the event of multiple applications competing for limited grant allocation, priority will be given to Arts in Education projects aimed at disadvantaged (DEIS) schools. In 2013, it is hoped that the Philanthropy Initiative, while continuing to provide an incentive to arts organisations to engage in fund-raising, will also encourage arts and culture organisations to engage creatively with children and young people and add to their education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000056#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"St&aacute;das na Gaeilge san Eoraip","counter":48,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000056#WRB01750"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[26246\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000056#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"an leagfaidh s&eacute; amach plean, ina mbeidh spriocanna bliant&uacute;la, maidir le l&iacute;on na n-aistritheoir&iacute; agus na n-ateangair&iacute; at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il do na poist ar ardchaighde&aacute;n at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il ag &Eacute;irinn san Aontas Eorpach faoi 2016; m&aacute; dh&eacute;anann s&eacute; sin, an bhfoilseoidh s&eacute; an plean seo chun go mbeidh na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; Gaeilge in ann cabhr&uacute; leis na spriocanna a bhaint amach agus chun go mbeidh an pobal ar an eolas faoi na deiseanna fosta&iacute;ochta at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il san Aontas Eorpach","asker":"1080","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":50,"content":"<p>I m&iacute; an Mheithimh 2005, chinn Comhairle na nAir&iacute; san Aontas Eorpach go mbeadh st&aacute;das mar theanga oifigi&uacute;il agus mar theanga oibre de chuid an Aontais ag an nGaeilge.

In order to allow my Department to be in a position to respond to issues as they arise during the course of the year, the &euro;124,000 is not yet fully committed and no expenditure has occurred to date. My Department will continue to minimise expenditure under this heading as far as possible and, as with 2013, I expect that savings will again be achieved against this allocation.<\/p><p>  For completeness, I wish to bring to the Deputy's attention that from time to time my Department also commissions engineering or environmental experts to provide technical reports on specific issues as required. While the providers of these services are consultant engineers, environmental consultants or may describe themselves in other such terms, their work is not classified as &quot;consultancy services and policy reviews&quot; and is not funded from the Department's Administrative Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000056#WRB02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Lough Leane Loop Trail","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000056#WRB02450"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[26012\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000056#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will provide an update on the round Lough Lein trail, County Kerry; the anticipated timeline for the project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":60,"content":"<p>In July 2012 I convened a Steering Group involving representatives of the key stakeholders in the Lough Leane trail project and charged the Group with the planning and development of the trail.

What was most clearly evident during the long and sometimes difficult discussions was the very strong and unanimous support among member States for efforts to reach a political solution to this appalling conflict.  The EU is extending its full support to the initiative of the US and Russia to bring all sides in Syria to the negotiating table on the basis of the Geneva Communique of June 2012.  In its Conclusions, the Council reaffirmed that the EU will spare no effort in helping to create the appropriate conditions for a successful convening of the conference which is envisaged.<\/p><p>  The EU also remains deeply engaged in efforts to address the horrendous humanitarian consequences of the conflict. The Union is the largest contributor to the UN-led humanitarian efforts, with some &euro;700 million pledged in support of the relief operations in Syria and in neighbouring countries.  The Council renewed its commitment to respond to humanitarian needs in Syria and in neighbouring countries and it urged all donors to fulfil pledges made at the Kuwait humanitarian conference on 30 January. <\/p><p>  Renewal of the EU's sanctions against Syria, including the arms embargo, gave rise to long and intense discussion within the Council.  I reiterated on behalf of the Government our firm view that lifting the arms embargo would be unlikely to assist efforts to achieve a political resolution.  On the contrary, the provision of arms to the Syrian moderate opposition, no matter how well-intentioned, is only likely to contribute to further militarisation of the conflict and to greater levels of violence in Syria and in the wider region.  I further stated my belief that lifting the arms embargo ran the clear risk of endangering the US-Russia led \"Geneva II\" initiative.<\/p><p>  It is obviously a matter of regret that the Foreign Affairs Council was unable to agree to renew the EU arms embargo against Syria.  As a result, this will now expire on 31 May.  However, I welcome the fact that the Council did agree to renew the remainder of the existing sanctions directed against the Assad regime.  These will continue in force for a further year, following adoption of a Council Decision later this week.    <\/p><p>  It is important to emphasise that all 27 member States of the EU remain fully united in their desire to promote the earliest possible end to violence and a political resolution leading to transition and the establishment of a functioning democracy in Syria.  In the Council Declaration that accompanied the Council Decision on renewal of the sanctions package, it was noted that no member State intending to do so will proceed at this stage with the delivery of arms to Syria.  The Council also agreed to review its position before 1 August on the basis of a report from the High Representative on the developments related to the US-Russia initiative and on the engagement of the Syrian parties.<\/p><p>  In relation to calls which have been made for the establishment of a no-fly zone over Syria, this would obviously necessitate broad international agreement and could only be authorized through a UN Security Council Resolution specifically mandating such a step.  Regrettably, the Security Council has not been able to agree any Resolution on Syria since the conflict erupted in March 2011 and it appears most unlikely that the political will exists within the Council at present to reach agreement on such a proposal. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000058#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid Provision","counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000058#WRD01450"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[26367\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000058#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on the expected level of funding that will be provided in his Department's budget for overseas aid in Budget 2014; if he will confirm that Ireland will be in a position to fulfil a commitment to keep its provision of overseas aid at 70 cent in every &euro;100 by the year 2015; and if he will indicate the current level of invigilation of that funding in programme countries; and the way his Department measures the impact and success of Irish Aid in each country concerned.","asker":"1020","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":109,"content":"<p>The Government is strongly committed to Ireland's overseas aid programme.

Over the past two years, the Government has broadly stabilised the budget for development assistance.  This is an important achievement.  We will endeavour to maintain aid expenditure broadly at current levels until economic circumstances permit us to make further progress towards achieving the 0.7% target. <\/p><p>  Preparations for Budget 2014 are currently under way.  Budget 2014 will be framed in the context of the Government's overall fiscal consolidation strategy of reducing the deficit to below 3% of GDP by the end of 2015.

These include the move from the very successful pilot to full implementation of the appointments service in the Molesworth Street office; and the withdrawal of the ordinary post service over time.<\/p><p>  In November 2012, the Passport Office in Molesworth Street launched a pilot programme to allow customers to book, via a simple web based system, guaranteed time slots before travelling into the office.  The pilot has proved very successful.  The public have responded very well to this pilot programme and in particular are very welcoming of the fact that the many hours previously spent queuing in the office has been eliminated.  Customers are now in and out having lodged their application in approximately 10 minutes.  Additionally the pilot has extended the public opening hours of the office from 09.30-16.30 to 09.00 -17.00.<\/p><p>  Priority in the system is given to those with urgent travel needs (travelling in 3-10 days) with the majority of appointments available to those who fit into this category.  Additionally, the Passport Service continue to provide the service of turning around applications on the same day in cases where a passport is required for travel necessitated by an emergency such as the death or illness of a family member.  All others are encouraged to use the passport express service.<\/p><p>  There has been a 33% decrease in counter applications year to date with a corresponding increase in passport express applications.  The appointments system critically allows the Passport Service to identify and prioritise those applications with greatest need for short turnaround.  Additionally, from the customer perspective, the change has removed the necessity for the public to queue for many hours, of unknown duration, and early in the morning outside in inclement weather.  <\/p><p>  For citizens resident on the island of Ireland, the cheapest and most efficient means of processing their passport application continues to be through the passport express services operated on behalf of the Passport Service by An Post and by the Post Office in Northern Ireland.  This service, which involves a pre-checking facility, has a maximum ten working day turnaround.  <\/p><p>  This compares favourably to postal applications not transmitted through the passport express system, of which over 90% are either inaccurate or incomplete on arrival, with 35% lacking the correct documentation and the vast majority lacking the correct fee.  As a consequence, these applications take more than twice as many man hours to process as passport express applications, thereby draining resources from the processing of valid applications submitted through the passport express system or through the appointment system.  <\/p><p>  With a view to further improving the quality of service to the public, therefore, applications from addresses on the island of Ireland received by regular and registered post after 30 June 2013 will be returned to the applicant who will be advised to resubmit their application through the passport express service.  Information on the changes to application procedures will be advertised in the national press, on the Passport Service website and through social media channels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000058#WRD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":113,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000058#WRD01875"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[26408\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000058#WRD01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the recent discussions he had, in addition to discussions the Minister of State for Trade and Development had, with the former British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the Right Honourable David Miliband; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":115,"content":"<p>I met with David Miliband on Wednesday, 22 May, in his capacity as former Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in the British government.

HR Ashton gave a short update to Ministers on the latest round of EU-facilitated dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina.  It is hoped that the implementation plan for the agreement reached between the two sides in April will be fulfilled by the end of this year. <\/p><p>  HR Ashton and the UK Foreign Secretary noted the successful outcome of the London conference on Somalia on 7 May, which raised $350m for justice, security sector and governance development programmes.<\/p><p>  Ministers had an exchange of views on the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) in preparation for the discussion on defence issues scheduled to take place at the European Council meeting in December.  In my intervention I noted the importance of civilian CSDP missions as instruments for advancing the EU's foreign and security policy objectives, and the importance of the December European Council also addressing these missions.  I agreed with other colleagues on the need to improve the management of civilian CSDP missions to ensure that they respond effectively to developing needs. <\/p><p>  While it was hoped to have a detailed discussion at the Council about the Middle East Peace Process, due to time constraints it was agreed that this item would be postponed until next month's meeting, when it is also intended that Conclusions will be adopted. <\/p><p>  As mentioned, discussions at the Council were dominated by consideration of the ongoing crisis in Syria in advance of the deadline for renewal of the EU sanctions package on 31 May.  There was strong and unanimous support among member States for efforts to reach a political solution in Syria.  The EU is extending its full support to the initiative of the US and Russia to bring the parties to the negotiating table on the basis of the Geneva Communiqu&eacute; of June 2012.  As emphasised in the Council Conclusions, the EU will continue to work with all stakeholders to try and find a peaceful solution to bring the conflict to an end. <\/p><p>  The Council renewed its commitment to respond to humanitarian needs in Syria and in neighbouring countries, notably Lebanon and Jordan, and urged all donors to fulfil pledges made at the Kuwait humanitarian conference on 31 January.  Renewal of the EU sanctions package, and in particular the arms embargo, was the subject of long and intensive discussion among member States.  In my intervention, I set out the Irish position, in particular our view that lifting the arms embargo is unlikely to assist efforts to achieve a political resolution.  On the contrary, the provision of arms to the Syrian moderate opposition, no matter how well-intentioned, is only likely to contribute to further militarisation of the conflict and to greater levels of violence in Syria and in the wider region.  I further stated the Government's belief that lifting the arms embargo runs the clear risk of endangering the US-Russia led \"Geneva II\" initiative. <\/p><p>  The Council agreed to extend, for a twelve-month period, all of the existing restrictive measures in place against Syria and its current rulers, with the exception of the arms embargo.  It is obviously a matter of regret that we were unable to agree to renew the arms embargo.  As a result, this will now expire on 31 May.  It is important to emphasise that all 27 member States of the EU remain fully united in their desire to promote the earliest possible end to violence and a political resolution leading to transition and the establishment of a functioning democracy in Syria.  In the Council Declaration that accompanied the Council Decision on renewal of the sanctions package, it was noted that no member State intending to do so will proceed at this stage with the delivery of arms to Syria.  The Council agreed to review its position before 1 August on the basis of a report by the High Representative on the developments related to the US-Russia initiative and on the engagement of the Syrian parties.<\/p><p>  Despite these difficult discussions, it is worth repeating that the EU remains fully supportive of, and engaged in, the efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution to this appalling conflict and to address its horrendous humanitarian consequences.  This position has been clearly affirmed in the Conclusions adopted by the Council on 27 May which can be accessed on the official EU website (links below).<\/p><p>- Council conclusions on Syria:<\/p><p>http:\/\/www.consilium.europa.eu\/uedocs\/cms_Data\/docs\/pressdata\/EN\/foraff\/137316.pdf (original version - EN)<\/p><p>- Council declaration on Syria:<\/p><p>http:\/\/www.consilium.europa.eu\/uedocs\/cms_Data\/docs\/pressdata\/EN\/foraff\/137315.pdf (original version - EN)<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000058#WRD02600","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":125,"content":"<p>Question No. 52 answered with Question No. 45.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Recruitment","counter":126,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000059#WRE00350"},{"type":"question","counter":127,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[26473\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000059#WRE00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the date on which the current panel for the recruitment of third secretaries in his Department was formed; when the panel will expire; the number of persons listed on the current panel and the number appointed from the panel; when a new panel will be formed to generate a new list of persons to be called to become third secretary; if applications for inclusion on the panel will be publicly advertised through the Public Appointments Service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":128,"content":"<p>The recruitment of Third Secretaries is conducted on behalf of my Department by the Public Appointments Service (PAS).

My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, takes the lead on Government policy in relation to biofuels and EU policy on biofuels, including the European Commission's proposal to limit the use of foodcrop-based biofuels in transport to 5% by 2020.<\/p><p><br \/>  The EU Renewable Energy Directive of 2009 requires that, by 2020, 10% of transport fuels should come from renewable sources.  The Directive also provided that the ongoing effects of its implementation be monitored by the European Commission.  Following a number of studies on the Directive's effects, in October 2012 the Commission published a proposal to amend the Renewable Energy Directive and the Fuel Quality Directive.  The Commission included a proposal that foodcrop-based biofuels should at most comprise half of the 10% quota required to come from renewable energy sources.  This proposal, in conjunction with the incentives for advanced (next-generation) biofuels, signals the desire of the Commission to move towards the use of advanced biofuels made from feedstocks which do not compete with the production of food.  While Member States agree that the issue must be addressed, it remains an extremely complex matter, and agreement has not yet been reached on the 5% cap. Negotiations are continuing, and it is expected that a progress report will be submitted for the meetings of the Energy and Environment Councils in June 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  The fight to end extreme hunger is, and will remain, a key priority for Ireland's international development programme, which takes a comprehensive approach to the challenge.  This includes a focus on good governance in respect of land use. The scale of the challenge of fighting global poverty and providing nutritious food for a growing population, in the context of a changing climate, was highlighted at the international Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Climate Justice which the Government organised in Dublin last month.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the context of its G8 Presidency, the British Government is hosting an important international meeting on hunger and under-nutrition in London on 8 June, on the theme '<i>Nutrition for Growth: Beating Hunger through Business and Science'<\/i><b>.  <\/b>Ireland is a core partner in this initiative and the Taoiseach will participate, at the invitation of the British Prime Minister. The event will build on the Olympic Hunger Summit held at Downing Street in August 2012, which the Taoiseach also attended.<\/p><p><br \/>  The London meeting will focus specifically on under-nutrition, an often silent element of hunger which has devastating consequences. Over 40% of children under the age of five in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are undernourished, putting them at greater risk of infection and death, and seriously limiting their ability to reach their full potential. I am determined that Ireland will continue our strong international advocacy and action to address hunger and under-nutrition.  In London, we will focus particularly on supporting efforts to harness public and private investment which will assist low-income countries to fight under-nutrition.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland's new policy on international development, <i>One World, One Future<\/i>  which was launched in early May, sets out in clear terms the goals and focus of our development efforts. It aims to enhance coherence of Government policies for development results. It will result in a more focussed approach across all Government Departments, harnessing the particular contributions, expertise and knowledge that each can offer. The Interdepartmental Committee on Development, which I chair, will have a strengthened role, and will be responsible for producing a biennial report on Ireland's progress on policy coherence for development.

In this context, we very much welcome the recent publication of the US Senate&rsquo;s Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill which provides for reform of the US immigration system.  The bill is progressing through the Senate system and on May 21, the Senate Judiciary Committee completed its detailed examination of proposals for comprehensive reform of the US immigration system as set out in Bill.  It is expected that the Bill will now go forward for further debate by the full Senate over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  The comprehensive draft legislation, which was drafted over several months by a bi-partisan group of eight US Senators, includes provisions that would legalise the status of thousands of undocumented Irish people and provide a path to permanent residency.  It also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US via the proposed E-3 visa.  The Bill is a very positive development.  Its provisions, if adopted, would help to end the great hardship and uncertainty faced by undocumented Irish in the US and their families here in Ireland.  The inclusion of a new provision to allow several thousand Irish citizens to legally avail of employment opportunities in the US every year is also particularly welcome.<\/p><p>  It is important to recall that the overall issues involved are complex and sensitive ones within the US political system.

It is a condition of any deferral that, if a claimant's circumstances change, Revenue must be notified.  A change of circumstances may result in the deferral being terminated in respect of future LPT.

Section 23A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 supplements this general rule and provides that certain companies incorporated in the State are to be regarded as being resident in the State for tax purposes. <\/p><p>  A company incorporated in the State is not regarded as tax-resident here where - either the company or a related company is carrying on a trade in the State and either &mdash; the company is ultimately controlled in a tax treaty country or in an EU Member State or the company or a related company is quoted on a recognised stock exchange in the EU or in a tax treaty country, or - the company is treated under a tax treaty as not resident in the State. <\/p><p>  Companies that are tax resident in Ireland are liable to tax on their worldwide income with credit given for foreign taxes paid on income earned abroad.  Companies that are not tax resident in Ireland and which do not carry on a trade in Ireland have no liability to Irish corporation tax and have no obligation to file an Irish corporation tax return or to identify the country in which they are resident for tax purposes.<\/p><p>  Non-resident companies that carry out business activities in Ireland through an Irish branch are not exempt from or outside the scope of corporation tax.  Such companies are liable to corporation tax on such proportion of their profits as are attributable to business activities carried on through the Irish branch.  These companies are obliged to file a corporation tax return but only in respect of their Irish branch operations.  The corporation tax return requires the non-resident company to tick a box on the return where the company in question is non-resident but has an Irish branch.  There is no requirement for such a company to identify its country of residence for tax purposes on its corporation tax return.  There is also no requirement for such non-resident companies that have an Irish branch to report their non-Irish branch profits to Irish Revenue as such profits are not, as a matter of law, subject to Irish corporation tax.<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no requirement in Irish tax law for a company to claim the status of Irish registered non-resident company.  While there is no requirement for a company to claim Irish registered non-resident status, the Revenue Commissioners as part of their normal compliance activity in the area of corporation tax, would seek confirmation from a company as to how it is structured and would verify that all relevant corporation tax rules have been correctly applied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000060#WRF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Compliance","counter":169,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000060#WRF01850"},{"type":"question","counter":170,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[26377\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000060#WRF01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of tax inspections conducted on companies with a turnover in excess of &euro;500 million and in excess of &euro;1 billion each year since 2000.","asker":"1080","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":171,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that data are not maintained in a manner which would enable this question to be readily replied to.

It relies on arbitrage between the different tax rules used in different countries and is categorically not part of the Irish tax offering.  Differences arise in the legal and tax systems between countries.  International tax planning takes account of these differences in national systems and rules.  What companies do outside of Ireland is beyond the scope of the Irish tax system.  We cannot conclusively determine the effective rate of tax paid under international tax structures by reference to taxation in Ireland alone.  <\/p><p>  The profits charged in Ireland fully reflect the functions, assets and risks located here by a multinational group.  The payments to the non-resident company represent the required remuneration of intellectual property assets funded and owned outside the State and its tax payments are properly reduced in these circumstances by reference to expenditure incurred for the purpose of its trade.  Ireland cannot expect to receive or retain the remuneration of these assets.<\/p><p>  The only way to effectively deal with such arrangements is for countries to work together to examine these structures and to consider how international rules can be amended to ensure fair levels of taxation.

All companies in Ireland pay the standard 12.5% rate on their trading profits arising in Ireland.  All companies here pay a corporation tax rate of 25% on their non-trading income, and chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.

I would also restate that Ireland is not a tax haven.  The OECD identifies four key indicators of a tax haven and none of these apply to Ireland: the first is having no taxes or only nominal taxes; the second is a lack of transparency; the third indicator is an unwillingness to exchange information with tax administrations of OECD member countries; and the fourth indicator is absence of a substantial activity requirement.  None of these criteria apply to Ireland.

The approach set out in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2013 on this matter is in fact designed to ensure that the same broad level of pension reduction is applied in the case of each of the two groups of pensioners referenced by the Deputy's question.  I would note that the reductions planned for public service pensions above &euro;32,500 apply to retirees from all sectors of the public service; and that Garda pensioners and other public service pensioners are treated alike.<\/p><p><br \/>  The fundamental change provided for in the Bill is that a public service pension that is currently valued in excess of &euro;32,500 will be reduced with effect from 1 July 2013.  The reduction in such pensions will range from 2% at around the threshold level of &euro;32,500 (subject to no pension being reduced below &euro;32,500) to 5% for the highest value public service pensions. Pensioners who retired up to end-February 2012, (i.e. during the 'original' grace period) are already subject to the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR).  The planned further pension reduction of 2 to 5%<font color=\"#A16252\"> <\/font>  will therefore be secured by increasing, with effect from 1 July 2013, the PSPR rates to which these pensioners are currently subject.

The fees for 2010, 2011 and 2012 in respect of Dublin Castle Gift Shop amounted to &euro;19,046.16. A tabular breakdown by site, of the sales income generated by visitor memorabilia in respect of the Office of Public Works sites for the years 2011 and 2012 is as follows.  The figures in respect of 2010 are currently being complied and will be furnished to Deputy O'Mahony in due course.  As the majority of Office of Public Works visitor sites have limited space and facilities to operate a retail outlet, and our prime focus is on the preservation and presentation of the sites in

These measures are contained at sections 42-51 of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999 as amended. <\/p><p>  First, as a precondition of incorporation, every application for registration is required to demonstrate that the proposed company intends to carry on an activity in the State. <\/p><p>  Secondly the 1999 Act required that every company registered in the state was required to maintain an Irish resident director or a bond to the value of &euro;25,394.76. The Irish resident director requirement was subsequently changed under the Companies (Amendment) Act 2009 to a requirement for a director resident in the European Economic Area. The requirement for either a bond or an EEA resident director does not apply if the company obtains from the Registrar of Companies a certificate that the company has a real and continuous link with one or more economic activities in the state. The company concerned must provide proof of such a link.<\/p><p>  A statement from the Revenue Commissioners that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the company has such a link is deemed proof of a link under the Act.

No. 461 of 2012) were signed, these Regulations had a deferred operational date of 1 June 2013. The main provision of these Regulations was the change in the definition of client by removing the phrase &quot;in the course or furtherance of a trade, business or undertaking, or who undertakes a project directly in the course or furtherance of such trade, business or undertaking;&quot;. This removal means that domestic home owners having construction works carried out on their own domestic dwellings will from 1 June 2013 have certain responsibilities under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2006 to 2012.<\/p><p><br \/>  Occupational health and safety is as important on a small domestic construction site as it is on a larger commercial site, possibly more so. Evidence has shown that between 2010 and 2012 many serious injuries and 11 deaths have occurred on domestic construction sites. The extension of responsibilities to include domestic home owners as clients will help combat such fatalities and serious injuries on domestic construction sites. Furthermore, in 2009 the European Commission began Infringement proceedings against Ireland regarding, amongst other things, the exclusion of domestic home owners from the definition of client. The introduction of the change in definition is necessary for Ireland to comply with our obligations under European law and avoid substantial fines for the taxpayer.<\/p><p><br \/>  Arguably, the increased standards will promote the use of experienced competent and reputable contractors thereby reducing undeclared work in the shadow economy. The Deputy refers to the owners of buy to let properties, I would like to point out that there will be no change to the responsibilities for such owners as landlords always had responsibilities to make appointments under the Construction Regulations as their properties would be considered within the criteria for a trade, business or undertaking. I would also point out that in relation to works carried out on domestic dwellings health and safety requirements existed prior to the introduction of this amendment.<\/p><p><br \/>  The provisions of the Construction Regulations apply to the contractors by way of their responsibilities to their employees in relation to provision of a safe place of work. The provisions of the Construction Regulations will now relate to all works that fall within the definition of construction work. This definition corresponds with that in Directive 92\/57\/EEC on implementing the minimum health and safety requirements at temporary or mobile construction sites. Exclusions to such provisions apply in situations where there is only one contractor on site and where there is no particular risk involved, and where the work does not exceed 30 days duration. Where individuals require advice on whether the works they are having done will require them to make appointments under the Construction Regulations they can consult the Health and Safety Authority for clarification. There are a number of tasks that are not affected by the change in the definition of client as they do not fall within the definition of construction work, for example routine home DIY, grass cutting, painting your garden fence, cleaning your windows, replacing your locks or getting new blinds fitted.<\/p><p><br \/>  There is a responsibility on all persons engaging others to carry out construction works to ensure themselves that the person they engage are competent to carry out the tasks they are engaged to do. The Health and Safety Authority have suggested a number of ways to assist domestic homeowners to assess competence, such as looking for certificates of competence in the trades involved or asking about previous works carried out and speaking to previous clients. The Authority is producing a helpful guide aimed directly at home owners having construction work carried out in their own homes, this will be available on the HSA's website (). A guide to assist contractors carrying out construction work on domestic dwellings will also be available and the Authority's workplace contact unit is available to the public to offer any assistance required (Lo Call 1890 289 389).<\/p><p><br \/>  Upon the making of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) (Amendment) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 461 of 2012), I asked the HSA to carry out a full review of the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2006 to 2012 and produce a consolidated set of Regulations. As part of this review I asked that the HSA identify revisions that can be effected to reduce the regulatory burden imposed on all clients in construction, while not diminishing workplace health and safety standards. A provision in the Regulations imposes a duty on a contractor to advise a client of his or her responsibilities under the Construction Regulations, where the contractor becomes aware of a situation where the client is not complying with their responsibilities. This consolidated set of Regulations will be in place shortly and will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as required by the Statutory Instruments Acts 1947 and 1955.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000065#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Enlargement","counter":314,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000065#WRL00750"},{"type":"question","counter":315,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[26447\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000065#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he intends to allow citizens of Croatia to have full access to the jobs market here under European Union freedom of movement of workers rules; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":316,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[26448\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000065#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"when he expects legislation to amend the Employment Permits Act of 2003 and 2006 to be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas to allow Croatian citizens, as the newest member of the European Union, full access to the employment sector here from 1 July 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":317,"content":"<p>I propose to take Question Nos. 123 and 124 together.<\/p><p>  On 9 December 2011, Croatia signed the Treaty of Accession to become the EU's 28th Member State. Ireland signed the Instrument of Ratification for the Croatian Accession Treaty on 21 September 2012. The ratification process, by the parliaments of all 27 EU Member States, is expected to be concluded by the end of June 2013. Therefore, entry into force and accession of Croatia to the EU is expected to take place on 1 July 2013. An assessment has been made, in light of analysis and recent data, of the possible impact on the labour market by granting access. The assessment included a review conducted by Forf&aacute;s which considered the likely impact of opening access to the Irish labour market to Croatian nationals following Croatia's accession to the EU.<\/p><p>  A number of factors are noted in respect of this issue. Firstly, it is highly unlikely that significant numbers of Croatians wish to migrate to Ireland. Ireland's current economic status presents a very weak &lsquo;pull&rsquo; factor for Croatians. There are low numbers of job vacancies except in areas experiencing a shortfall in skills supply e.g. Information Technology &ndash; additional migrants to such sectors would be welcome. International studies show that migration is heavily influenced by existing migrant populations and established social networks in the destination country. Eurostat estimates that there are approximately 350,000 Croatian nationals currently resident in the EU. Germany, Austria and Italy account for 91% of Croatian nationals living within the EU. According to the 2011 Census, there are only 846 Croatian nationals resident in Ireland. There is therefore not a sufficient population of Croatians in Ireland at present to create an attracting factor.<\/p><p>  There is a very low propensity for Croatians to emigrate. A Gallup survey undertaken in 2010 suggests that the numbers of Croatians with firm intentions of leaving Croatia are relatively low (only 0.1% of the adult population or 4,000 people were considering moving permanently from Croatia in the following 12 months). Ireland did not feature as a target destination. This corresponds with Employment Permits data concerning nationals of Croatia where only 12 employment permits were issued in 2012 in respect of Croatian nationals. Secondly, in quantitative terms the size of Croatia&rsquo;s labour force is relatively small with a total labour force of 1.78 million with only circa 350,000 people in the 25-34 age group (generally the most mobile demographic of a country&rsquo;s population). Ireland's labour market, in line with EU obligations, is already open to an EU workforce of 229 million.<\/p><p>  Thirdly, experience suggests that opening access to the Irish labour market may not have a significant impact on the State's services. PPS numbers are a unique reference number issued to persons when transacting with Government Departments and other Public Bodies. The experience in respect of Bulgaria (a country with a labour market twice the size of Croatia and to which Ireland gave full access to its labour market in 2012) suggests that only a modest increase arose in respect of PPS registrations which could not be described as having a distortionary impact on the Irish labour market.<\/p><p>  Fourthly, a further factor borne in mind when estimating the impact of access versus restrictions to a labour market, is the issue of undeclared work. The Government decision pertains only to employment - Croatians will, in any event, enjoy certain rights afforded to all EU citizens from 1 July and will therefore be able to reside in Ireland subject to restrictions under the Residence Directive. Such nationals will be able to study, work as self-employed, or establish businesses here. Applying restrictions to employment when it is possible work as self-employed can increase the potential for undeclared work. The main problem with undeclared work is that workers fall outside the tax net. They are also more likely to undercut minimum wages in low-skilled jobs and might contribute to the observed unemployment rate if this undeclared work displaces jobs among registered members of the labour force.<\/p><p>  Finally, it was noted that Ireland has an excellent relationship with Croatia and it is important that this relationship is developed further for the benefit of both countries. Bearing in mind that Croatia applied for membership of the EU under Ireland's last Presidency of the EU it is timely that Croatia will join the EU just after the conclusion of Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the EU. By providing full access, Ireland is continuing its policy of openness to new Member States and highlights the need for continued EU solidarity. Based on the evidence available, Forf&aacute;s concludes that it is unlikely that Croatia's entry to the EU will have a significant distortionary impact on the Irish labour market and recommended that transitional arrangements should not be applied in the case of Croatian nationals seeking to work in Ireland following Croatia's accession to the EU. In light of all these issues, Government has decided not to exercise an option under the Treaty to restrict access to Ireland&rsquo;s labour market for nationals of Croatia. As legislation must be enacted in order to give legal effect to the opening of Ireland's labour market to Croatia upon its EU accession, the Bill will be introduced as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000065#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Relations","counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000065#WRL01050"},{"type":"question","counter":319,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[26456\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000065#WRL01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the recommendation that Ireland made to the European Commissioner for Trade, Karel De Gucht, on his proposal that the European Union impose a 47% tariff on imported Chinese solar panels and telecommunications equipment; if he joined other member states in pressing the Commission to drop the proposed import tariffs; his policy in relation to this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":320,"content":"<p>The European Commission initiated anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations on imports from China of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules (Solar Panels) and key components.

The number of young long term unemployed represented a fall of 8,300 on the  figure of 35,600 at the end of 2011.<\/p><p>  In the first instance, the Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle all forms of unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.  Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.<\/p><p>  The Government is also implementing a number of programmes to assist young unemployed persons and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market.  There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance\/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies and includes the Youthreach programme providing 6,000 integrated education, training and work experience for early school leavers without any qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age.  The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme scheme provides a range of courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people over 21 years of age, particularly focusing upon early school leavers.  The Back to Education Allowance scheme run by the Department of Social Protection provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education.  Over 6,500 young people participated on this scheme in the last academic year.<\/p><p> Approximately 12,000 persons aged under 25 completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2012.  This excludes apprenticeships and evening courses.  This year MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions, which is part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs initiative, is currently being rolled out by the Department of Education.  MOMENTUM will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 long term jobseekers to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors.  Over 1,250 of these places are assigned specifically for under 25s.<\/p><p>  The JobBridge National Internship Scheme is focused on providing work experience to young people with the total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 at 2,700.  Long-term unemployed youth will also benefit from the JobsPlus initiative which is designed to encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people.  Under this scheme, the State will pay circa &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the employer to recruit a person from the Live Register.<\/p><p>  In the December Budget, funding was secured for an additional 10,000 places this year across a range of programmes, including JobBridge, T&Uacute;S and Community Employment.  About a quarter of these places are expected to be taken up by unemployed young people. <\/p><p>  With regard to the expected impact of policy, the original Action Plan for Jobs sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people.  In this context, the Department of Finance anticipates that the overall unemployment rate will fall from 14.7% in 2012 to 12.3% in 2016.  This could be expected to see youth unemployment fall from over 30% in 2012 to 24% or less in 2016. <\/p><p>  In addition, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 includes the Pathways to Work initiative&rsquo;s targets for increasing the number of people who are long-term unemployed moving into employment and reducing the average length of time spent on the Live Register.  Specifically, these targets are that at least 75,000 of long-term unemployed people will move into employment by 2015 (starting 2012); to inncrease the exit rate of people on the  live register  for two years or more by 50% (to 40%) by the end of 2015; and to reduce the persistence rate (the rate at which short term unemployed people become long term unemployed) to 25%.  As two out of five young unemployed are long-term unemployed, these targets are pertinent to young people. <\/p><p>  A new recruitment incentive, JobsPlus, has also been developed by my Department and was approved by the Government as part of the Action Plan for Jobs, and is aimed specifically at the long-term unemployed.  This incentive will cover the cost of c. &euro;1 in every &euro;4 of an employer&rsquo;s wage costs and will be launched for availability by July 2013.  Young people are likely to be major beneficiaries of this initiative as employers tend to hire young people when there is a recovery in employment.<\/p><p>  Following from the formal adoption of the EU Recommendation on Implementing a Youth Guarantee, the Government will review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.<\/p><p>  The scale and nature of the measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is to be hoped that the favourable developments in the number of young unemployed seen in 2012 is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  <\/p><p>  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will almost certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education, training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment. It is to be hoped that any measures taken by government in relation to the implementation of the youth guarantee will see youth unemployment fall even further than is already anticipated on the basis of existing policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000066#WRM00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":334,"content":"<p>Question No. 130 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Status","counter":335,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000066#WRM00650"},{"type":"question","counter":336,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[26310\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000066#WRM00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Carlow will receive a decision on a review they sought for an exceptional needs payment; and if she will expedite an answer.","asker":"968","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":337,"content":"<p>The person concerned will have a decision on the review next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000066#WRM00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Appeals","counter":338,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000066#WRM00850"},{"type":"question","counter":339,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[26316\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000066#WRM00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a disability allowance appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":340,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the person concerned was assessed by a Medical Assessor of the Department of Social Protection who was of the opinion that she was capable of work.

The second is the school meals local projects schemes through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.  The Government has allocated an additional &euro;2 million for the school meals programme in 2013, providing a total allocation of &euro;37 million.<\/p><p>  The school meals programme normally operates in line with the academic year, from September to the following June. There are approximately 1,300 schools\/groups in the programme for the current academic year benefitting over 191,000 pupils.  Priority for funding is given to schools which are part of the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills&rsquo; initiative for disadvantaged schools, &lsquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rsquo; (DEIS).  The Department has written to approximately 170 DEIS schools requesting expressions of interest in participating in the scheme for the coming school year. To date, some 75 schools have expressed an interest in participating in the scheme. <\/p><p>  The Department also contacted a further 11 schools\/groups who had already made an application to join the scheme. These schools were invited to participate in the scheme for the remainder of the current school year. One organisation, a School Completion Programme in Bray, Co.

This programme will provide a food club for children attending St. Fergal&rsquo;s Senior National School in Ballywaltram, Bray, Co. Wicklow.

Employers, unions and trustees have been making strenuous efforts to protect the viability and many measures have been introduced to support these efforts.  Between 1980 and 1999, the defined benefit pension environment was healthy with average pension schemes managing fund returns of the order of 20% per annum.  Until 2000, few schemes had any difficulty meeting the Funding Standard.  DB pension schemes have suffered a series of shocks over the last number of years.  At the end of 2007, 80% of defined benefit pension schemes satisfied the Funding Standard.  At the end of 2008, following the downturn in financial markets, the situation was reversed with in excess of 80% of schemes failing to meet the Funding Standard at the end of 2008.  The Funding Standard was suspended at that time in order to give the trustees and sponsoring employers adequate time to assess their schemes and consider a response to improve the funding position.   <\/p><p>  The reintroduction of the Funding Standard was delayed on a number of occasions pending changes to legislation which were designed to help trustees respond to the funding challenges facing pension schemes and protect scheme members.  These changes were carried out in the context of the publication of the Green Paper on Pensions in 2007, the downturn in financial markets in 2008, and the review of the defined benefit pension model in 20010\/2011:<\/p><p>- Significant legislative changes in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act in 2009 allowed for the restructuring of underfunded schemes by removing the priority given to post-retirement increases for pensioners to ensure a more equitable distribution of assets in the event of the wind-up of a DB scheme;<\/p><p>- The powers of the Pensions Board were strengthened to ensure that pension contributions are remitted by employers to scheme trustees;<\/p><p>- The Pensions Insolvency Payments Scheme was established to reduce the cost of purchasing pensions for trustees where the employer has become insolvent;<\/p><p>- Legislation was introduced in 2010 and 2011 to provide the option of a sovereign annuity for trustees;<\/p><p>- Changes to the defined benefit model and the Funding Standard were introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012.  The re-introduction of the Funding Standard followed;<\/p><p>- Legislation is being brought in the current Social Welfare and Pensions Bill to strengthen the powers of the Pensions Board. <\/p><p>  The primary change to the Funding Standard in 2012 was the introduction of a requirement for a risk reserve to assist the longer term stability of defined benefit schemes.  This was introduced to provide a &quot;buffer&quot; against volatility in the financial markets and provide some level of protection for scheme members.  The risk reserve has an in-built mechanism to incentivise trustees to better match their assets with the scheme's liabilities in their investment strategies and guidance was issued in this regard.  In view of the current funding status of defined benefit schemes, an extended time period was given for the introduction of the risk reserve: it will be operable from 2016 and schemes do not have to meet the reserve until 2023. <\/p><p>  Trustees of defined benefit schemes are expected to submit funding proposals to the Pensions Board at the end of June 2013.  At present, it is considered that 80% of schemes are underfunded.  It is the responsibility of the Pensions Board to ensure that the minimum funding standard is enforced and I will be receiving regular updates from the Board on the timeliness of submissions.  Following receipt of proposals, it will be possible to get a more accurate indication of the level of under-funding in defined benefit pension schemes.  It will also allow for the impact of the many measures already introduced by Government to be assessed, including the potential benefits to schemes of the use of sovereign annuities\/bonds.  Compliance with the regulatory structure is essential for the future sustainability of defined benefit schemes and to protect members' benefits.  <\/p><p>  This requires consideration of a number of policy options, including corporate debt.  The Review of the Irish Pension System which was published by the OECD in April this year which described the Funding Standard (including the recent changes) as &quot;undemanding&quot; will also inform further developments in this area.  I am keeping the situation under review and will report back to Government in the coming months on these issues.  A wider package of legislative proposals and additional reforms will be considered at that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000068#WRO01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Appeals","counter":413,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000068#WRO01550"},{"type":"question","counter":414,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[26571\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000068#WRO01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a domiciliary care allowance appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork.","asker":"993","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":415,"content":"<p>An application for domiciliary care allowance was received from the person concerned on the 14th November 2012.

The second is a relocation interim legal agreement for qualifying turf cutters who have expressed an interest in relocation but no relocation site is currently available for them to relocate to.  This relocation interim legal agreement provides for the payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum while these applicants are awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs.  The third is a relocation final legal agreement.  This agreement has been issued to qualifying turf cutters where a site has been assessed as suitable for relocation and is ready or can be made ready for use for domestic turf cutting. <\/p><p>  Turf cutters who sign and return the applicable legal agreement to my Department will also receive a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500.  The legal agreements are modelled on those which have been agreed with groups of turf cutters from Clara Bog in County Offaly, and from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog in County Galway.  The explanatory document which accompanies the legal agreements was drafted by officials of my Department.  The interim legal agreement is required in the case of relocation sites because, for the majority of raised bog special areas of conservation, the relocation site and the terms and conditions applicable to those sites will take time to finalise.  Turf cutters are being asked to sign the interim agreement on the understanding that when a relocation site is sourced, assessed and agreed they will be asked to sign a final legal agreement at that time.  If it is not possible to find a suitable relocation site, for example, for reasons of quality or quantity of turf, planning requirements, or issues in relation to the purchase or lease of a site, then the Department will consult with turf cutters as to the best option to take at that time.  <\/p><p>  For the avoidance of all doubt, it is the absolute aim of my Department to secure a relocation site for every person who has applied for one.  That is what my officials are working to achieve, and progress is being made in that task.

The agreements being issued reflect this reality.  The interim agreement is designed to give all stakeholders the time to deliver relocation options that work for turf cutters.  The clear directions that I have given my officials is to examine all relocation options with a view to securing alternative cutting locations for as many turf cutters within the shortest timeframe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000068#WRO01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Architectural Heritage","counter":420,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000069#WRP00150"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[26476\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000069#WRP00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the criteria used for the allocation of the structures at risk fund 2013; if county councils are able to apply for funding in next year's programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":422,"content":"<p>I recently announced the allocation of &euro;475,000 in grant funding to thirty-four local authorities under my Department's Structures at Risk Fund 2013 to enable conservation works to forty-five heritage structures in both private and public ownership deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration and which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000 - 2012.

To this aim I recently met with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to enhance co-operation between my Department and both tourism bodies in promoting heritage and tourism.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am particularly conscious of this in the context of 2013 being the year of The Gathering initiative.  My Department is actively engaged in a wide range of activities to this end, both in co-operation with bodies such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Office of Public Works, and in promoting its own initiatives such as our 'Places to See' and 'Monuments to Visit' websites, which provide directions to lesser known heritage sites and details of what the visitor can expect to find on arrival. Capital funding is provided by my Department to support the Office of Public Works' conservation programme for the State's heritage portfolio, many properties from which attract high levels of visitors to Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  The unique qualities of Ireland's national heritage play a significant role in enhancing and projecting Ireland's image abroad, and in supporting economic renewal through cultural and heritage tourism and in downstream opportunities, such as in the retail, catering and accommodation sectors.  For example, I understand from F&aacute;ilte Ireland that some 3.5 million overseas visitors engaged in cultural activities while in Ireland in 2011.  Over 2.5 million tourists visited historic houses or castles, while 2 million visited our archaeological monuments, with over 3.7 million visitors to heritage sites where the Office of Public Works provides a guide service.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department's network of National Parks and Nature Reserves are also a major part of Ireland's tourism attractions.  It is my intention to encourage and facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, public access and appropriate visitor use in these parks and reserves. Such access and use must, of course, be consistent with the ethos of the parks as natural places of peace and tranquillity set in scenic landscapes, as well as being compatible with the conservation and biodiversity considerations that are of necessity associated with the management of heritage properties.<\/p><p><br \/>  Despite current economic challenges, it is my intention to invest in visitor facilities in the parks and nature reserves to maximise their sustainable use and enjoyment. To this end, and building on previous investment in this area, my Department is working on proposals to further develop visitor facilities, such as walking and cycling routes, enhanced signage and interpretation. <\/p><p><br \/>  As regards visitor centres, in the last couple of years my Department opened modern visitor focussed centres at Ballycroy National Park, Co. Mayo, Clara Bog Nature Reserve, Co. Offaly, and a visitor information point for the Burren National Park in Corofin, Co. Clare.<\/p><p><br \/>  I anticipate that the redevelopment of Killarney House in Killarney National Park will be a major tourism asset in years to come. The House, once complete, will serve as the main visitor and interpretative centre for the National Park, highlighting the beauty and interpreting the richness and significance of the Park's landscapes, habitats, flora and fauna, as well as telling the story of man's interaction with the Park over the centuries. It is also intended that some of the formal rooms will be restored to their former glory.  This is a major project for my Department and involves collaboration with OPW as project managers and F&aacute;ilte Ireland which has committed funding of &euro;5.2 million towards the project, under its Tourism Investment Programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, my Department provides core funding for several heritage organisations such as the Heritage Council, which supports a range of initiatives including National Heritage Week, and the Irish Architectural Foundation, which runs the successful Open House event each year.<\/p><p><br \/>  This year, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, my Department is also initiating a pilot programme, the <i>Historic Towns Initiative<\/i>, in Youghal, Westport and Listowel with the Heritage Council and the local authorities in each town.   My primary objective with this initiative is to ensure that the participating towns have access to, and an understanding of, appropriate guidance to assist them in best conserving their heritage assets and, in so doing, underpin the sustainability of their community and local economy.  It is my hope that meeting these goals will also, by extension, significantly enhance the visitor experience in these towns, thus helping to maximise the potential positive contribution of tourism to each of these towns and their respective hinterlands.<\/p><p><br \/>  These are just a sample of the overall range of initiatives and programmes my Department is helping to promote, support or guide as a means of preserving the quality and diversity of our heritage, which in turn, is basis for positively promoting that heritage abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000069#WRP00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":431,"content":"<p>Question No. 165 answered with Question No. 21.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme Payments","counter":432,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000069#WRP01050"},{"type":"question","counter":433,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[26506\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000069#WRP01100","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which settlement has been reached with the various turfcutters and or bog owners throughout County Kildare who have been affected by EU generated special areas of conservation or nationally imposed restrictions; the extent to which relocation or other are imminent in respect of the remainder of cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":434,"content":"<p>There are 2 raised bog special areas of conservation in County Kildare affected by the cessation of turf cutting - Ballynafagh Bog and Mouds Bog.  56 applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme have been received and acknowledged by my Department in respect of Ballynafagh Bog and 101 applications have been received and acknowledged by my Department in respect of Mouds Bog. 28 and 39 of these applicants respectively have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog. 42 payments and 8 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of the applications received from Ballynafagh Bog and 51 payments and 35 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of the applications received from Mouds Bog.<\/p><p>  Progress has been made with a view to the relocation of qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog to Timahoe North, County Kildare.

The opportunity to harness this resource for the export market, and realise its potential for investment, job creation and economic growth has been identified.  To this end, I signed a Memorandum of Understanding on energy cooperation with my UK counterpart, Mr Edward Davey, on 24 January this year.  This Memorandum of Understanding clearly signals the joint interest of Ireland and the United Kingdom in developing the opportunity for trading in renewable energy to our mutual benefit.<\/p><p>  Detailed consideration of how Ireland's onshore and offshore wind resources might be developed for export to the UK is now underway, with a view to determining if it is beneficial for both countries to enter into an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) under the EU Renewable Energy Directive.  There are very complex issues to be considered, including the actual scale of the export generation capacity required.  Though it is ambitious, the target for completion of this work on the IGA is early 2014.<\/p><p>  Should an Inter-Governmental Agreement be entered into, the development of any new wind farms for the export market would be underpinned by a clear policy framework.  Such developments would also be subject to a selection process and to the Planning and Development Acts, including their requirements for public consultation.  The mechanism for remunerating any wind farms that may in the future export renewable energy to the United Kingdom has yet to be decided, but will not involve any subsidy costs being imposed on the Irish State or consumer. Any Inter-Governmental Agreement would also have to ensure an adequate return to the Irish Exchequer.<\/p><p>  There are potentially significant employment opportunities arising from the building of wind farms developed for export under a possible Inter-Governmental Agreement.  It is estimated that a 3,000 megawatt development could provide between 3,000 and 6,000 job years in its construction phase, depending on the timescale for completion of the project. There is also potential for jobs in the on-going maintenance of turbines over a 20-year operating life.<\/p><p>  Further employment opportunities could arise if turbines or components were to be manufactured in Ireland.  All relevant State agencies, particularly in the enterprise area, would have to coordinate their activities early in the process to ensure employment potential of export projects is maximised.  This opportunity has already been identified by the Investment Development Agency and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technology growth strategies.  Recruitment of the work force for the development of wind export projects would be a commercial decision for the project promoters concerned, and subject to in the normal way to Irish and EU employment law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000070#WRQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Provision","counter":456,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000070#WRQ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":457,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[26308\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000070#WRQ00800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the lack of broadband facilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":458,"content":"<p>Ireland's telecommunications market has been fully liberalised since 1999 in accordance with the requirements of binding EU Directives.

The latest figures show that by the end of March this year, 22,733 Pay As You Go electricity meters, 18,000 token meters and 38,592 gas Pay As You Go meters had been installed under this provision.  <\/p><p><br \/>  I welcome the fact that the CER continues to work with industry and customer advocacy groups (such as the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and St Vincent de Paul) to ensure that these measures are working as effectively as possible and to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to assist customers through this difficult period and that disconnections resulting from genuine inability to pay are minimised and only occur as a very last resort.<\/p><p><br \/>  Implementation of the measures set out in the Government's Affordable Energy Strategy, published last November, is pivotal to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers and improving energy affordability.  In addition, the Government will continue to support the delivery of energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households in 2013.  Funding of &euro;17 million to Better Energy: Warmer Homes in 2013 will support the delivery of energy efficiency measures to approximately 10,000 homes.  This will result in energy savings of 18 GWh, corresponding to monetary savings of &euro;1.8 million (4.6kt CO<sub>2<\/sub>).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000070#WRQ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hydraulic Fracturing Policy","counter":462,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000070#WRQ01150"},{"type":"question","counter":463,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[26337\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000070#WRQ01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will report on his recent attendance at the information session on fracking at the Royal Irish Academy, Dublin; his policy on fracking; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":464,"content":"<p>On 17 April, 2013, I attended the Information Session on Fracking at the Royal Irish Academy.  The Academy hosted this discussion in order to place scientific facts on the record in a measured manner.  Speakers at this meeting included, Professor Shannon, Geosciences Committee, Professor Richard Davies University of Durham, Professor Padraic O&rsquo; Donoghue, Chair Engineering Sciences Committee, Dr. Rob Ward, British Geological Survey and Dr. Gareth Ll Jones, Institute of Geologists of Ireland and Conodate.<\/p><p>  I spoke at the information session and provided an update on Ireland&rsquo;s current position with regard to fracking in terms of the award of Licensing Options over parts of the Lough Allen and Clare Basins, advising that such Licensing Options are designed to allow companies assess the natural gas potential of the area; that they are largely based on desktop studies of existing data from previous petroleum exploration activity and that any drilling activities that would involve hydraulic fracturing are excluded under these Options.  I confirmed that since those Options were granted, my Department has not approved any application for, nor licensed the use of, hydraulic fracturing in the Irish onshore. <\/p><p>  I acknowledged in my address that there is a considerable and genuine concern about the potential environmental and health considerations related to this activity and that the nature of the debate so far has tended to exacerbate these concerns and I welcomed input from the Academy because whatever decisions are taken must be based on transparent assessments of solid evidence.  For this reason in October 2011 I asked the EPA to examine the whole issue of fracking and its potential environmental implications.  I have commissioned the EPA to undertake a broadly-based study, in order to identify best practice in respect of environmental protection for the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques.  The terms of reference for this research have gone out to public consultation, and have elicited a large response.  It is anticipated that this research will commence in the second half of this year.  The conduct of the study is expected to take at least 12 months, and I confirmed that any applications for exploration licences proposing the use of hydraulic fracking that may be received in the interim will be put on hold, pending publication of this important research.<\/p><p>  In the context of my address, I also briefly discussed the global economic perspective to the unconventional oil and gas phenomenon, including the US boom in unconventional fossil fuels which has, in the main, been supported by populations already accustomed to onshore oil and gas production, favourable fiscal regimes, financial interest of land owners in oil and gas production on their property, and the already existing infrastructure in the form of pipelines and service industries.<\/p><p>  It is recognised that the advent of unconventional oil and gas has been a 'game-changer' on the US energy market with global repercussions, but is also playing a significant role in economic development in the US.  As the EU is likely to remain a &quot;higher&quot; energy cost region in the future, it is unavoidable that we consider the impacts that unconventional oil and gas production will have on security of supply, energy prices and competitiveness.  At the end of April as President of the EU Council, I hosted an informal meeting of the EU's Energy Ministers.  Several EU member states are weighing the benefits and risks of exploiting shale gas reserves and this meeting afforded an opportunity to compare notes on this issue for the first time.<\/p><p>  It will be the end of 2014 before Ireland completes a rigorous interrogation of the geological and ground water data, impacts and mitigating measures and regulatory issues to inform the policy options here and I can confirm that scientific analysis will inform any actions that might be contemplated in Ireland thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000070#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Speeds","counter":465,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000070#WRQ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":466,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[26386\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000070#WRQ01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will issue a detailed progress report on the roll out of broadband high speed broadband to all parts of County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":467,"content":"<p>Ireland's telecommunications market has been fully liberalised since 1999 in accordance with the requirements of binding EU Directives.

Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Kerry, can be found on ComReg's website at .  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme.  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU's target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  During the preparation of Ireland's National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services.  More detailed information on the broadband products offered by the relevant service providers should be available on their respective websites.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department has recently appointed experts to assist in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  My Department is about to embark on a formal mapping exercise to identify the areas of the country to be targeted in the State-led investment under the Government's National Broadband Plan to ensure the provision of high speed broadband services where the commercial market will not deliver.

In my Presidency capacity at EU level during the first six months of this year, I very specifically raised this issue with my EU Ministerial colleagues with a view to establishing a mechanism to better support protection of fundamental rights and the Rule of Law in Member States by sharing best practice, monitoring standards and formulating appropriate recommendations and guidelines for action across the Union as an effective response to this problem.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment that we will promote policies which integrate minority ethnic groups in Ireland, and which promote social inclusion, equality, diversity and the participation of immigrants in the economic, social, political and cultural life of their communities. A significant level of activity is taking place in pursuit of this commitment.<\/p><p><br \/>  A number of key departments and agencies have developed specific strategies to ensure that their services respond to Ireland's changed demographic in an interculturally competent and inclusive manner. The strategies developed include: an Intercultural Health Strategy; an Intercultural Education Strategy; a Cultural and Arts Policy and Strategy; the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Diversity Strategy; and an Action Strategy for Integrated Workplaces.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration has responsibility for leading and coordinating work relating to the integration of legally resident immigrants. The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration continues to work with many sectors including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local authorities, sporting bodies, Government Departments, the social partners and broader civil society including cultural and ethnic minorities, to further progress the integration and diversity management agenda.<\/p><p><br \/>  Funding has been provided to a number of local authorities around the country and local programmes have been undertaken to educate the public on issues such as immigration, integration and anti-racism. For example, Dublin City Council ran an anti-racism campaign on the Dublin transport system in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 using funding provided by the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration.  Dublin City Council also support a number of festivals supporting diversity such as the Chinese New Year and the Indian Diwali 'festival of lights'.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration also provided support to an NGO called Show Racism the Red Card to run a creative competition for school children in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Funding was also provided to the Holocaust Educational Trust for educational initiatives that teach children the dangers of racism and the importance of integration and tolerance.  Further details of the work done by this Office in the area of managing diversity and combatting racism including details of the funding granted to promote integration between the established and immigrant communities is available at www.integration.ie.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Garda Racial, Intercultural and Diversity Office is also constantly working through community engagement to urge people to come forward and report any suspected racist crime to their local Garda&iacute;. It advises the public about the existence of Ethnic Liaison Officers and also of the services available to victims of hate crime at the Garda Racial Intercultural and Diversity Office. The services of Ethnic Liaison Officers are advertised on the Garda website and appointed officers are named with details of their station.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy's correspondent may also wish to consult the links on the website at  where she will note the many non-governmental organisations active in this field.

Restorative justice in the context of youth crime was introduced on a statutory basis for the first time in the Children Act 2001, as amended.  There are two restorative justice initiatives provided for in the Act: a restorative conference or restorative caution included in the Garda Diversion Programme and a court-ordered restorative justice family conference delivered through the Probation Service.<\/p><p><br \/>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na use Restorative Justice processes in the delivery of the Diversion Programme under Part IV of the Children Act, 2001, as amended. Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers (JLOs) are trained as Restorative Justice Practitioners and in Mediation Skills. The latest Annual Report of the Committee to Monitor the Effectiveness of the Diversion Programme indicates that JLOs dealt with over 900 cases using a restorative justice approach where a crime was committed by a young person. In addition since 2010, the report indicates that eight 8 JLOs qualified as trainers in restorative practices and collaborated with local communities and other agencies, in particular, the Probation Service in delivering training and developing restorative practice communities.  Restorative Justice philosophy has also been introduced to Garda Youth Diversion Projects which are managed by the Irish Youth Justice Service and operate on the basis of a strategic partnership between IYJS, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and community based organisations. Since 2011, facilitator skills training in Restorative Justice has been rolled out to Youth Justice Workers working in the projects.This training programme is ongoing during 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  Young Persons Probation (YPP) works within the Children Courts nationally to implement all relevant requirements of the Children Act 2001, (as amended) in particular Part 8 (Probation family conference) and Part 9 (orders relating to community supervision) of the Act.<\/p><p><br \/>  All Young Persons Probation staff have been trained in the preparation, delivery and action planning\/monitoring which are essential to the Probation family conference (Part 8 of the Children Act 2001 as amended).  Conferences are convened at the request of the Courts within 28 days and subject to the satisfactory production and completion of the action plan, there is an option for full diversion from the Criminal Justice system. The Probation Service in conjunction with its partner agencies has also introduced and consolidated a number of Restorative Practices\/approaches in the management of court ordered supervision in the community and more infrequently supervision following a period of detention. These include, victim awareness\/empathy work, Restorative conferences (not court ordered but part of supervision contract with young person and parent), Victim Impact Panels which include community volunteers and Victim\/Offender Mediation.  YPP staff have received accredited training in Restorative Practices and the majority of dedicated staff are now up skilled in this area. This training is frequently provided on an interagency basis. <\/p><p><br \/>  While I am satisfied with the work undertaken to date and the ongoing developments in the roll out of restorative justice initiatives, I will continue to monitor the impact of these latest developments in conjunction with the criminal justice agencies involved, and the results will be taken on board in considering future developments in this area.   <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000073#WRT00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Spent Convictions Legislation","counter":554,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000073#WRT00700"},{"type":"question","counter":555,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[26346\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000073#WRT00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012 will be initiated; if a person who was convicted of cannabis possession in 2005 will have their conviction spent under the Bill; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":556,"content":"<p>In relation to the timeframe for the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 210  of  22 May 2013, copy under.<\/p><p><br \/>  As regards a conviction for the possession of cannabis, the Bill's provisions are based on the sentence imposed rather than on the offence committed.

Incentivised Regimes provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour. The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment. There are three levels of privilege - basic, standard and enhanced.<\/p><p>Each prison has developed an information booklet on how the scheme operates and specifically on the criteria and privileges associated with each level of regime.<\/p><p>The standard set of core privileges provided in each prison comprises of different levels of daily gratuity ranging from &euro;0.95 to &euro;2.20, the number and length of visits a prisoner is allowed to receive and the number of telephone calls a prisoner is allowed to make. Each prison has drawn up a list of privileges available under each regime level. The list of available privileges is likely to vary between prisons and within different areas of a prison, depending on the operational and infrastructure requirements of each prison. Examples of other incentives offered include improved accommodation ( e.g. move from dormitory accommodation to a single cell in an open centre, move to a cell with in-cell sanitation), access to facilities such as DVD player, games consoles, etc, and access to employment opportunities within the prison e.g. kitchens, laundries etc.<\/p><p>The table following shows the number of prisoners at each level broken down by institution on 27 May, 2013.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Institution<\/th><th><div>Basic<\/div><\/th><th><div>Standard<\/div><\/th><th><div>Enhanced<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><td><div>140<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Castlerea<\/td><td><div>13<\/div><\/td><td><div>163<\/div><\/td><td><div>176<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cloverhill<\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><td><div>290<\/div><\/td><td><div>119<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><td><div>135<\/div><\/td><td><div>88<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dochas<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>80<\/div><\/td><td><div>58<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><td><div>169<\/div><\/td><td><div>67<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Loughan House<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><td><div>126<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Midlands<\/td><td><div>11<\/div><\/td><td><div>270<\/div><\/td><td><div>461<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mountjoy<\/td><td><div>24<\/div><\/td><td><div>250<\/div><\/td><td><div>255<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Portlaoise<\/td><td><div>11<\/div><\/td><td><div>35<\/div><\/td><td><div>152<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Shelton Abbey<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>107<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>St. Patrick's<\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><div>86<\/div><\/td><td><div>65<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Training Unit<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><td><div>99<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wheatfield<\/td><td><div>34<\/div><\/td><td><div>357<\/div><\/td><td><div>307<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000073#WRT01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Staff","counter":567,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000073#WRT02000"},{"type":"question","counter":568,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[26435\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000073#WRT02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of officers that have been made available to integrated sentence management in each prison; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"990","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":569,"content":"<p>The Irish Prison Service is implementing an Integrated Sentence Management (ISM) initiative within the prison system. ISM involves a new orientation in the delivery of services to prisoners and an emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with both specialist and non-specialist services in the prisons.  The end result is a prisoner-centred, multidisciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress.<\/p><p>Over 1,000 new prisoners participated in ISM in 2012. At the end of April this year there were over 2,300 current and active cases and over a thousand prisoners had sentence plans in place at that time.<\/p><p>Currently 16 ISM Co-ordinators are in place in 10 institutions as set out in the table underneath. The staff concerned are made up of redeployments and others who are functioning on an acting basis into the roles. It is envisaged that, through further redeployments and a forthcoming internal competition, full time ISM Co-ordinators will be assigned to all prisons in the coming months. Having a dedicated team of ISM Co-ordinators in all prisons will enhance the effectiveness of the sentence management system and facilitate the growing numbers of prisoners participating in the process.

In keeping with the normal practice at informal meetings, no binding decisions were made, but the meeting made a very valuable contribution to the ongoing negotiations by giving all three institutions the opportunity to discuss each other&rsquo;s positions and explore the potential for reaching common ground on these issues. <\/p><p>  As regards direct payments, attention focused on the distribution of payments within Member States (also known as internal convergence), capping and reduction of payments (the latter also known as degressivity), and voluntary coupled support. On capping, the Council has a clear mandate from the European Council conclusions on voluntary capping, and much of the discussion focused on the question of whether degressivity should be voluntary or mandatory. On voluntary coupled support, the Parliament argued for a higher level of support than that proposed by the Council.<\/p><p>As to internal convergence, this is clearly the biggest issue for Ireland in the negotiations. There is much common ground between the Parliament and the Council concerning the model of partial convergence originally proposed by Ireland and supported by a number of Member States, as an option for Member States.  However, the Commission re-stated its preference for a minimum rate of convergence. Further discussion on the issue of redistribution or internal convergence will take place between now and June and Ireland very clearly raised concerns at the informal Council with regard to the Commission&rsquo;s proposals on a minimum payment.   <\/p><p>  Three issues under the Single CMO regulation, namely, sugar quotas, export refunds and vine planting rights, were addressed. On sugar quotas, the main issue is the date of expiry of the quota regime, with the Council position (2017) between the Commission (2015) and Parliament (2020) positions. On export refunds, attention focused on whether this measure should be confined to exceptional or crisis circumstances only, as now suggested by the Parliament, or whether it should remain a normal part of the so-called &lsquo;safety net&rsquo; measures, as agreed by the Council last March. On vine planting rights, the debate focused on two key points, namely, the commencement and expiry date of a proposed new authorisations regime, in respect of which the Council generally occupies the middle ground between the Commission and Parliament positions.<\/p><p>  As regards the rural development proposals, attention focused on proposed areas of natural constraint (formerly known as less favoured areas), and particularly on the commencement date for the new arrangements, where again, the Council generally occupies the middle ground. Finally, on the so-called &lsquo;horizontal&rsquo; regulation, which deals with the financing, management and monitoring of the CAP, discussion centred on the number of paying agencies per Member State, where the Council wants to keep the number to the minimum necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000076#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Applications","counter":655,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000076#WRW00800"},{"type":"question","counter":656,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[26449\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000076#WRW00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a disadvantaged area scheme payment will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":657,"content":"<p>Under 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, holdings of eligible applicants are required to have met a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units for a retention period of six consecutive months, in addition to maintaining an annual average of 0.15 livestock units calculated over the twelve months of the scheme year.

The issue of compensation during the compulsory phase of the BVD programme must be placed in the context of the economic benefits accruing to farmers arising from the eradication of this disease as well as the scarce budgetary resources available to my Department.  The benefits of the BVD programme represent a private good to farmers: profitability improves as a result of the removal of BVD persistently infected (PI) animals from herds and the payback period for the removal of these animals is very short (6 months for dairy cattle and one year for beef cattle).<\/p><p>  Eradication of BVD disease is important to farmers and the strategy of my Department remains one of concentrating its scarce resources in continuing to support Animal Health Ireland financially in its ongoing work in developing the necessary infrastructure   to eliminate the occurrence of BVD from the national herd, thereby minimising financial losses for farmers and improving animal welfare.

Persistently infected (PI) animals will shed high levels of virus throughout their lifetime and are a major source of infection for other animals.  In light of this, the Order prohibits the movement of these animals except for disposal directly to slaughter or under Ministerial permit. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000076#WRW01400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Applications","counter":662,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000076#WRW01500"},{"type":"question","counter":663,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[26452\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000076#WRW01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a farmer who is in REP scheme 4 will receive their 2012 disadvantaged area scheme payment; the reason for the delay in making this payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":664,"content":"<p>Under 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, eligible applicants are required to have met a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units for a retention period of six consecutive months, in addition to maintaining an annual average of 0.15 livestock units calculated over the twelve months of the scheme year.

The EU Sugar Regime underwent a radical reform in 2005 following major EU decisions to restructure the industry.  A temporary restructuring scheme was introduced with the aim of reducing EU sugar production.  Greencore, the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota, availed of this voluntary scheme, dismantled its facilities and ceased production in 2006.  Ireland secured &euro;353 million as part of the reform package of which &euro;220 million went to beet growers, &euro;127 million to Greencore and &euro;6million to machinery contractors.  There is no mechanism under the present EU Regulations which would allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for the production of sugar.<\/p><p>  I know you will be aware that in 2011 I met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of establishing a new sugar\/bioethanol facility in the country.  I understand from figures published by the interested groups who are investigating the possibility of building a new facility, that the overall capital cost costs involved could range from &euro;250 million to &euro;400 million, depending on what type of facility will be constructed.  At the meetings I stated that any venture to develop a combined sugar\/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense in order to be viable.  I also further suggested to both groups, the desirability of there being only one single proposition in play, as both studies had indicated a potential for only one such viable project and both groups had appeared to accept the reasonableness of this position at the time.  Only recently, I re-stated that any business plan for a new venture in this area, would need to be competitive and that it would have to justify the very substantial investment to build a new facility.<\/p><p>  I have strongly supported the current EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals to completely abolish sugar quotas from 30 September 2015, as part of the ongoing CAP Reform discussions.  At each meeting of the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers since October 2011, which has addressed this issue, I have intervened to fully support the Commission proposals for quota abolition.  I also raised the issue with EU Agriculture Commissioner Ciolos during his visits to Ireland last year and in several other contacts with him, I have informed him of the growing momentum here for the revival of the sugar industry.<\/p><p>  In recent discussions at the Council of Agriculture Ministers, which I am chairing under our EU Presidency responsibilities, a deep divide emerged between one group of Member States, including Ireland, which favoured abolition of quotas in 2015 and another group of Member States which wished to extend quotas to 2020 and beyond.  As current President of the Council, I made a compromise proposal that garnered the support of a large majority of Member States, to extend the quota regime for a further two years until 30 September 2017 when it will finally cease.  This is the formal negotiating mandate for the Agriculture Council, as we enter the final phase of the ongoing CAP Reform negotiations.  The European Parliament is in favour of extending quotas to 2020.  The Council is now in detailed trilogue discussions between the EU Commission and the Parliament on the general CAP Reform package, including the future of the EU sugar regime, and I am hopeful that I can bring these talks to a successful conclusion before the end of our Presidency role on 30 June next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000077#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fodder Crisis","counter":690,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000077#WRX00750"},{"type":"question","counter":691,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[26533\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000077#WRX00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will extend the imported fodder rransport scheme for at least a further two weeks in view of the difficulties facing the farming community particularly in areas such as counties Cavan and Monaghan where very unfavourable weather conditions continue to prolong and intensify the fodder crisis and farm income problems; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":692,"content":"<p>On 24 April I established a &euro;1 million transport fodder scheme to help alleviate the difficulties being encountered by farmers.

The approach I am taking in developing  the Strategy has received Government approval.  My intention is to create an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s early years sector and a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to 6 years.<\/p><p>  A broad range of issues relating to regulations, standards, quality assurance, and inspection are currently being considered by the Expert Advisory Group which is advising my Department on the Strategy. As Minister I am committed to ensuring high standards in early years service provision, both in terms of care and curriculum.  The role of quality provision is critical in contributing to childhood development and I an determined that this key objective will be reflected fully in the Early Years Strategy.  One of the specific issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the future role and regulation of the childminding sector, which is already an important component of early childhood care and education.  At present preschool services are subject to the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.<\/p><p>  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three preschool children from different families in the childminder&rsquo;s home.<\/p><p>  The National Guidelines for Childminders, compiled by the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee established under my Department, provide guidance to childminders in regard to the Regulations and good practice in the provision of child care services.  In that context, the City and County Childcare Committees, which assist my Department in implementing its early childhood care and education programmes, encourage childminders to voluntarily notify themselves to their local Committee.  As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the Child Care Regulations set the minimum standards which services are legally required to comply with.  My Department will continue to adopt a pro-active approach to promoting the highest standards of care and education throughout the sector, including childminders, given their importance in this crucial phase of children&rsquo;s lives.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I published the Draft Heads and General Scheme for the Children First Bill 2012 on 25 April 2012 and immediately referred the Heads of Bill to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for consideration and advice.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children published their report in July 2012.  As part of the Joint Committees consultation process a number of submissions were received.  Overall there was a welcome that the legislation would increase the focus on child protection.  The contributions in the main came from organisations already implementing Children First.  Submissions were not all in agreement and many points emerging needed to be considered and reconciled.  This involves consideration of policy and operational issues, including those pertaining to childminders, as well as the best legal approach to achieving Children First objectives. In this regard, officials within my Department have consulted with a number of organisations and individuals and I recently met with a number of key stakeholders to discuss the complex issues that have arisen. I have also taken the opportunity to consult with a number of experts in relation to the development of the policy in this area. These discussions will inform the preparation of enhanced policy proposals that is currently underway.<\/p><p>  The obligations of mandatory reporting are onerous and the inclusion of specific professionals and post holders is being considered very carefully at this time including persons working in the child care sector generally.  I should emphasise that under the existing Children First National Guidelines, there is very clear advice available to all employees, volunteers and parents on how to raise any concerns they have about a child's safety and welfare.  It is my intention to submit further proposals to Government as soon as possible with a view to the drafting of the Children First Bill as a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000077#WRX01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Adoptions","counter":702,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000077#WRX01550"},{"type":"question","counter":703,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[26365\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000077#WRX01600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will outline her Department's engagements, if any, with families who have adopted children born in Mexico and who have subsequently been unable to have these adoptions recognised or registered here; and if she will report on the extent to which her Department is working with families affected to come to a resolution of their difficulties.","asker":"1020","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":704,"content":"<p>The responsibility for the registration of intercountry adoptions is a matter for the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI), an independent quasi judicial entity established under the Adoption Act 2010.

Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.

The savings required in 2014 in the youth budget under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure amount to &euro;2.976m. Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department has tried to be as equitable as possible in achieving these savings. In considering how best to manage within the reduced budgets available, organisations are being asked to consider the scope for reducing administration costs and overheads, if this is at all possible, in order to maintain the front line youth services for young people. I have met, and continue to meet with, many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to minimise the impact of these necessary savings in order to ensure that the provision of quality youth services to young people is sustained in these challenging times.<\/p><p>In 2011, For&oacute;ige, following an internal review of the organisation&rsquo;s wide range of provision for young people, reprioritised its areas of youth provision and programmes.  This reprioritisation, which was proposed to my Department, enabled For&oacute;ige to strengthen their Big Brother Big Sister (BBBS) Programme nationally.  For&oacute;ige decided, with the permission of my Department, to reallocate the funding provided by my Department from their Youth Information services to the Big Brother Big Sister Programme.  Additional funding was also provided by my Department to For&oacute;ige for the Big Brother Big Sister Programme in 2012 and 2013.  While I fully appreciate the value of the Big Brother Big Sister Programme and the challenges facing it in the current fiscal climate, given the savings required within my Department's budget under the CRE, I do not envisage any further scope for the provision of any further increase on the funding already provided to For&oacute;ige.<\/p><p>A comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding has been commenced in my Department and it is anticipated that the findings of this report will inform the future development of youth programmes and services.  My Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year. The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000078#WRY00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":719,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000078#WRY00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Issues","counter":718,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000078#WRY00500"},{"type":"question","counter":719,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[26557\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000078#WRY00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a commitment to the long term future of a school (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":720,"content":"<p>I am having enquiries made of the Health Service Executive in relation to the matter raised by the Deputy.

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme. There has been no change to the Government&rsquo;s over-arching commitment to this goal. This Government is the first in the history of this State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. <\/p><p>  On examining the progress made in the universal GP care plan, it has became clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic for a short-term arrangement. Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness. The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public. This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions. As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition. While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. <\/p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the delay in the initial step of the roll-out of the universal GP service. In doing so, it has considered the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay. <\/p><p>  No decision has been taken by the Cabinet Committee or by Government on changing the first step of the plan to extend GP care without fees to persons with chronic illnesses. Instead, it has been agreed that we should prepare and set out a number of alternative options with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  Minister Reilly and I expect to report back to the Cabinet Committee in the near future. As part of this work, consideration will be given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation this universal health service.  <\/p><p>  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources in the two most recent Budgets. The HSE Vote now contains funding of &euro;30 million for this year for an initial phase of the provision of GP services as part of this Programme for Government commitment.<\/p><p>  To conclude, far from abandoning its commitment to universal GP care, this Government is determined to expedite the implementation of a national GP service for the entire population, something to which no previous Government has ever aspired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000079#WRZ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":775,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000079#WRZ02050"},{"type":"question","counter":776,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[26392\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000079#WRZ02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny will receive an appointment for hip replacement surgery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"973","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":777,"content":"<p>The National Waiting List Management Policy, <i>A standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, January 2013,<\/i> has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.

The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is 10% to 11% for the general population.  Five to ten per cent of all breast cancers are explained by the presence of BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 gene mutations, which increases the lifetime risk to 60% to 80%.<\/p><p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) established a National Hereditary Cancer Programme in 2011 with the National Centre for Medical Genetics in Crumlin Hospital. There are two groups of women involved &ndash; those who have been diagnosed with cancer and those who have a family member who has been found to carry a gene mutation. <\/p><p>  The NCCP has launched cancer genetic clinics in St James's and the Mater Hospitals in 2011 and 2012 respectively, with the addition of a new service in Cork University Hospital in 2013. The programme is primarily focussed on patients who have hereditary breast, ovarian and bowel cancer.  <\/p><p>  This has led to a 30% increase in the number of patients seen and assessed.  In 2012 the clinics in St James&rsquo;s and the Mater Hospitals have assessed and tested almost 200 women (with breast or ovarian cancer) for the BRCA gene mutation. This represents over a 100% increase in the number of women tested nationally, compared with 2011.<\/p><p>  The NCCP has confirmed that there are waiting times for genetic testing for patients with suspected hereditary cancer mutations.  This delay relates mainly to the need for genetic counselling prior to being tested, in order that women are fully informed of the implications of a positive test result.  It is inappropriate to have the test without counselling. <\/p><p>  The NCCP and the National Centre for Medical Genetics are continuing to work to ensure that the service is expanded to meet national needs.  This improvement in access to counselling and genetic testing will reduce the current waiting times.  <\/p><p>  The NCCP will also work to implement the recommendations of the recent HIQA Report on Breast Cancer Surveillance, which outlined the potential benefits of a standardised surveillance programme for women aged less than 50 years at elevated risk of breast cancer due to a genetic predisposition or a strong family history.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000080#WRAA00400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme","counter":786,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000080#WRAA00450"},{"type":"question","counter":787,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[26418\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013053000080#WRAA00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Kildare will receive confirmation of funding under the nursing home support scheme;

The future of the LDCs is a matter for that Department.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p><p>  An overall budget of &euro;9.133 million has been allocated by the Department of Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport to the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) for 2013, representing a small decrease on the 2012 allocation of &euro;9.77 million, at a difficult time financially.  My aim is to strengthen the RTP by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making\u00a0the programme a sustainable part of the public transport system. This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.\u00a0 To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0with effect\u00a0from 1 April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.<\/p><p>  I am well aware of the very valuable work done by RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community.\u00a0 However, given that resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is\u00a0necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.\u00a0 Current structures are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved. If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline. Work has been underway over the last six months to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. This has involved consultations with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the County and City Managers Association and the Rural Transport Network.<\/p><p>  I have not as yet taken any decisions on restructuring.\u00a0.
