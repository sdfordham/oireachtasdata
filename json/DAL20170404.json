People are extremely frustrated, annoyed and angry by the lack of activity at Government level to resolve this dispute.  The simple refrain across Ireland is that if this dispute was in Dublin, it would have been resolved a long time ago.  That is the general sense in regional cities, rural towns and across the countryside and one which we encounter all the time.  There is massive disruption.  Many businesses are reporting a significant decline in footfall and business activity in the towns and cities affected.  Some 2,500 staff are also very worried about their position, notwithstanding the 110,000 people who use Bus &Eacute;ireann services which are no longer available to them.<\/p>  <p>  We have insisted from the beginning that there are policy dimensions to this issue which the Government refuses to acknowledge.  The Minister has stated, for example, that one cannot have cross-subsidisation of the Expressway services from public service obligation, PSO, funding.  That is not true.<\/p><p>The NTA can through the reasonable profit mechanism, which is there and which is allowed under EU regulations, facilitate transfers under that facility to the bus companies.  It is interesting that under that arrangement Dublin Bus received &euro;4.5 million last year while Bus &Eacute;ireann received &euro;400,000.<\/p> <p> The Dublin-rural issue is evident again when comparing how Dublin Bus is funded under the PSO and how Bus &Eacute;ireann is funded.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is not getting its fair share and is not getting a reasonable deal.  The same applies to free travel.  Bus &Eacute;ireann recoups approximately &euro;4.70 per passenger availing of free travel on the Expressway service while the average fare is &euro;11.74.  There has been a significant reduction in the free travel subsidy since 2010.  The reasonable profit mechanism might sound complex as a formula but the bottom line is Bus &Eacute;ireann gets a lower subsidy per passenger than Dublin Bus under the PSO operation as well.  Whatever way you look at this, rural and regional Ireland is not getting its fair share.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is an indispensable part of the transport infrastructure of rural Ireland and of the towns and cities outside Dublin.  That sense of prioritisation is not manifest in the Government's response to this crisis.<\/p> <p> From the outset the company has insisted on preconditions before the unions enter into WRC talks, which is unacceptable.  The talks should be without precondition but they should be assisted.  Why will the Government not make an intervention on the policy front that would create the background, which would facilitate a resolution of this dispute at the WRC?  The Government and the NTA have options open to them if they see fit to use them but so far the Government has been determined to avoid any consideration of legitimate policy issues that could help here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400003#A00300","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491311100,"counter":9,"content":"<p>This is the 12th day of an all-out strike at Bus &Eacute;ireann and it has discommoded hundreds of thousands of people.  I condemn the wildcat strike which took place unofficially last week and which brought this city and so many other places, as well hundreds of thousands of people, to a standstill.  The Deputy mentioned that this would have been sorted out long ago if it was in Dublin, drawing an analogy that the country is being treated differently from other areas.  The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Sport has intervened in respect of policy decisions in so far as the PSO is concerned and his colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills has been looking at the question of the school transport system while the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has been looking at the question of rural transport take-up of any changes that might occur to the Expressway service.  The Deputy said it is possible to cross-subsidise the service; my information is different.  Subvention is only provided for PSO services and it cannot, under law, be provided for commercial services such as the Expressway service.  The Deputy seems to have a different view on that and that is something I will check.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the unions and management get together with the WRC.  As the Deputy mentioned whatever way you look at it - and whatever you look at it, the Deputy is correct - there is a strike on here and the only way to settle that is around the table between unions and management.  They have both agreed there are issues that need to be dealt with and the company needs to reform how it goes about its business to address the inefficiencies that exist.  The place to settle those issues is not on the airwaves; it is around the table assisted by the WRC.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has been more than encouraging that unions and management would get together on this matter.  The only parties that can agree a fair and acceptable deal to sort this out and have Bus &Eacute;ireann continue to do the job it has done for many years are those in management and in unions.  Nobody else can do that deal for them and no amount of taxpayer's money can solve the inefficiencies that both management and unions agree exist within the company.  They both want to talk about them and the opportunity is available through the WRC to settle this.<\/p>  <p>  On matters of policy, the Minister has been active.  On matters of encouraging both sides, unions and management, to get back to talks at the WRC, I hope an invitation to resume those talks will be extended to them quickly and that people will understand that realistic negotiations between management and unions are required to solve these internal issues.<\/p><p>The WRC and the LRC are ready to assist, as they played a leading role in dealing with previous industrial relations within the CIE group.  The biggest impact is on Bus &Eacute;ireann's PSO network.  Those who rely on those services have little alternative public transport options.  The impact is lessened on the loss-making Expressway network as there are numerous competitors providing bus services in addition to the rail network.  It is an issue that can only be sorted out at the WRC.  I hope an invitation is extended to both union and management again quickly to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400004#B00200","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491311400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Since 2016, the NTA, under EU regulations, has had to pay a reasonable profit on PSO services to CIE companies.  Where a reasonable profit is paid to a director or operator, it is a matter for that company to decide how it wishes to apply these funds.  It goes through all the possible applications of reasonable profit.  No one is arguing that Bus &Eacute;ireann is not very successful at discharging its PSO service obligations because it is.  One of the anomalies that has arisen is with regard to the amount paid to the two semi-State bus companies.  Why is Bus &Eacute;ireann being paid so little in contrast to Dublin Bus?  In 2016, Bus &Eacute;ireann was only paid &euro;400,000 in reasonable profit while Dublin Bus was paid &euro;4.5 million.  That is 11 times more than Bus &Eacute;ireann.  That is despite the fact that Bus &Eacute;ireann is paid a lower subsidy per passenger than Dublin Bus for PSO services.  If the Government was serious about this and committed to it, there are ways and means of contributing to its resolution, not by saying it is entirely the workers of the company who have to bear the brunt of all of the restructuring, which is what has happened to date.  People are facing 30% cuts in their take home pay.  That is the Government position.<\/p>  <p>  The company is fortified by the position taken by the Government and the Minister, which is a race to a bottom in terms of wages.  It is a savage cut and a disproportionate burden on the workers in terms of the restructuring and the transport policy dimensions which not only involve what I have just spoken about but also the free travel issue.  The company has lost a lot since 2010 in terms of the subsidy it used to enjoy per free travel passenger.  The Taoiseach has an obligation for the Government to make sure this is resolved fairly quickly.  What I said to the Taoiseach at the outset is not my opinion.  It is the opinion of the people across the country that if this was in Dublin it would have been resolved a long time ago.

The extent of the damage done to the Garda cannot be overestimated - it is immense.<\/p>  <p>  This issue is bigger than any political party.  It is about the fundamental administration of justice.  People across the country in every community are left scratching their heads as they wonder how someone who has messed up so badly and presided over fiasco after fiasco is still in her job.  They are wondering how N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan is still the Garda Commissioner.  People rightly ask themselves how ordinary rank and file garda&iacute; can be expected to account for their actions when their boss, the top garda in the country, is immune from that same basic standard of accountability.

In no other walk of life would this be a matter for debate.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner is not a new kid on the block.  She has been the boss for three years and was deputy commissioner prior to taking the top post.  It is unbelievable that the T&aacute;naiste accepts the Commissioner's line that she must remain in her role to complete her \"journey of work\", as she describes it.  This is the same journey of work that has fostered the list of debacles in which the Garda finds itself embroiled.  Does this journey also include her speculating out loud as though she were some detached onlooker that the controversy around breath tests and motoring offences might not be the end of scandals surrounding the Garda?  Is the Taoiseach okay with this frightening lack of accountability?  He is in charge.  This corruption, malpractice and mismanagement in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is happening on his watch.

This is bigger than any political party, as the Deputy says.  It is bigger than any individual, and it is about trust and confidence, it is about respect, it is about pride, it is about an organisation of 14,000 people - that rises to 15,000 people - being able to be seen to do their job professionally, competently and in the interests of the State in which we reside and the people that they have a duty of care to in terms of both their security and their protection from criminal elements.<\/p>  <p>  This goes back quite a distance, as the Deputy is well aware.  I might say to her that the Government treats this with the utmost seriousness.  The T&aacute;naiste briefed the Cabinet this morning on her proposals for a commission on the future of policing in Ireland arising from the decision made last week by Government that there should be an independent analysis of the figures in respect of fixed notice penalties and the question of breathalyser statistics.  Both of those have been referred to the independent Policing Authority, which, as the Deputy knows, has the full right to contract in any expertise - national or international - that it so wishes to look at those statistics and determine how they happened, why they happened, who is responsible and who is accountable.<\/p>  <p>  The second decision that the Government made was on the longer term restructuring of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and that is not in any way to take from the valid propositions put forward by the independent Garda Inspectorate.<\/p><p>It is not to take in any way from the exceptional work now being carried out by the chairperson of the independent Policing Authority, Ms Josephine Feehily, or from the review and additional powers being sought by Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.

As he is in the mood for catching up, he might want to catch up on another issue as well.  I refer to the case of a young man who has narcolepsy, which is a lifelong debilitating disorder.  He can fall asleep without warning and has done so.  He has smashed his teeth and broken his bones.  He experiences terrifying hallucinations in a state of sleep paralysis.  He has to be given expensive anaesthetics so that he can get a few hours' sleep.  He has developed joint and muscle pain.  He suffers from anxiety and depression to the extent that he has tried to kill himself.  He is 14 years of age.  This condition, for which there is no cure, limits every aspect of his daily life.  While his condition is bad, the worst thing is that he did not always have it.  He was not born with it.  It is not a genetic disorder.  This was an avoidable catastrophe.  This young man, like 80 others, developed the condition as a result of receiving the Pandemrix vaccination for swine flu in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive and the State Claims Agency went into the High Court last week unnoticed and undocumented to obstruct this boy and people like him who are seeking documents under discovery.  The HSE and the SCA said they would voluntarily disclose these documents in 2015.  We need to be clear about the fact that the HSE decided to purchase Pandemrix and continued to distribute it even after it knew it was dangerous and untested and before most of the public in Ireland received it.  It knew there was a sevenfold or eightfold risk of serious adverse effects in comparison with its sister drug and alternative vaccinations for which there were no adverse side effects.  Poland, Switzerland and the US did not give a licence to Pandemrix, but Ireland gave GlaxoSmithKline, GSK, full indemnity against its harmful side effects.  Incidentally, the company made &euro;8 billion in profits out of it.<\/p>  <p>  In 2009, before 95% of Irish children were vaccinated, the Irish Medicines Board, which is now known as the Health Products Regulatory Authority, was told there was a huge difference between the safety profiles of these vaccines.  Did the board tell the Minister about this, as it had a statutory obligation to do?  Given that it was in possession of that knowledge, why did it continue to administer the least safe vaccine?  Was it cheaper?  Did the Government have a deal with GSK in return for jobs?  Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland, France and, recently, Britain have all compensated victims.  In contrast, this country's Government is continuing to deny the requests of victims for discretionary medical cards and other benefits.  I want to know why Ireland is the only country that does not operate a no-fault vaccine damage payment scheme.  Will the Government introduce such a scheme and order the SCA to co-operate with it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400008#F01700","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1491312600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Daly for raising this matter, which is of intense personal sensitivity for the young person involved.

We will follow that up for the Deputy.  The Minister for Health has met representatives of SOUND, which is the support group for people with narcolepsy, in recent days.  He has sanctioned the go-ahead for the centre of excellence for sleep disorder at St. James's Hospital.  This has been sought for a very long time and has been welcomed by the group involved.  As Deputy Daly knows, the programme for Government includes a commitment to examine supports for people who have been harmed by vaccines.

Parents are distressed about the inadequate provision of care for their children as they get older.  Some parents are fearful that their adult children will be moved from congregated settings, where they have lived for most of their lives, to community settings.  Parents are struggling to transport their adult children to disability day centres.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Taoiseach aware that a significant number of parents, in particular those living in west Cork and Kerry, are driving their adult children for up to four hours a day to the nearest disability day centre?

The fact is that if one has a child with severe disabilities who is 18, he or she is not entitled to a free transport service to day-care centres.  If that child is a day younger than 18, he or she will get a free transport service.  That is a fact.  I have been approached by parents all over west Cork and Kerry and there are probably others throughout Ireland.  Parents have been travelling on a daily basis from Bandon, Bantry and Skibbereen to and from the service in Cork, which is a twice daily journey.  I have met with those parents and spent time discussing the matter with them.  I have been in contact with the HSE but I cannot succeed in getting people to sit around the table despite the fact that we still have a situation in which buses with only one or two people on board are passing very close to these centres already.  It is simply a matter of people sitting down and using their heads.  There must be a policy that can be applied.

He was to speak to the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Shoukry, last week, but that meeting did not happen because he was held up in Washington on Middle East business.  The Egyptian authorities were more than willing to assist in this matter.<\/p>  <p>  While this might not be a normal intervention, it was done because of the comments in respect of Ibrahim Halawa's health.  The Government arranged for an Irish doctor nominated by the chief medical officer to go to Cairo last week.  He participated in a consular visit to Ibrahim Halawa at the Wadi el-Natrun prison on 29 March with the ambassador.  He was there for four hours.  They met Ibrahim Halawa for an hour and a half.  The doctor observed a medical examination of Ibrahim Halawa carried out by an Egyptian doctor.  It is not appropriate for me or any other Government spokesperson to reveal or comment on the details of Ibrahim Halawa's health condition.  As the Deputy knows, these matters are private and confidential.  However, I can say the Irish doctor, who is a GP, recommended that specialist medical evaluations take place and that Ibrahim Halawa be returned to Ireland for such assessments and on humanitarian grounds.<\/p>  <p>  Last evening I sent another urgent letter to President el-Sisi on the basis that he be released on humanitarian grounds.

We in the Social Democrats are committed to significantly extending both paid and unpaid parental leave in Ireland.  The Bill deals with the extension of unpaid parental leave.  It seeks to extend the rights of parents to parental leave from the current 18 weeks to 26 weeks.  The Bill would mean that all parents with qualifying children would have an entitlement to six months' parental leave.  The six month entitlement would also apply to those parents who have already exhausted their existing leave entitlement once they have qualifying children.  In effect, such parents would receive an additional eight weeks per child.<\/p><p>Parents in Ireland must rely on the European Union institutions rather than this country for parental leave rights because our current parental leave entitlements derive almost entirely from EU legislation.  While member states are allowed to go further, Ireland has stuck to just above the bare minimum of leave set down by Directive 2010\/18\/EU.  It is time we legislated for parental leave of our own volition, rather than being prompted to do so by the EU.<\/p> <p> The Bill is primarily about work-life balance.  Working parents lead very busy lives.  For many, there is a constant struggle to do the best they can for their children while trying to hold down a job.  For others, the cost of child care is so prohibitive that they forgo their employment because the cost of going to work outweighs their salary.  While reducing child care costs is important in itself, another help to parents is extending parental leave.  We must, therefore, go much further than the current provision.<\/p> <p> Extending parental leave has many benefits for families, employers and society as a whole.  It allows parents to hold on to their job while spending more time with their children.  It is very much in the interests of young children that they have engagement with their parents from an early age and can make strong bonds with and enjoy sustained attachment to their parents.  Various studies have shown that strong parental supports, including parental leave, improve female participation in the workforce.  This leave also provides flexibility to parents.  With no statutory entitlement to term time leave in Ireland, it can be used, with an employer's agreement, to cover term time.<\/p> <p> By reducing demand for formal child care, extra parental leave can help reduce the cost pressures for everyone in this sector.  There is no cost to the State and in most cases no net costs to employers.  From an employer's point of view, parental leave can be critical in retaining key employees.  It can help improve succession planning, reduce absenteeism and boost productivity.  Parental leave also opens up opportunities in the workforce for people who are unemployed. <\/p> <p> Ireland falls well behind other countries in terms of parental leave, both paid and unpaid.  Parental leave is paid in a majority of other European Union countries and only six EU countries, apart from Ireland, do not allow for income replacement when taking parental leave.  According to a recent European Commission staff working paper on this issue, the average duration of parental leave among member states is 86.9 weeks.  The Bill would begin the process of bringing Ireland closer to European norms.<\/p> <p> The Social Democrats are offering this Bill as a starting point.  We are open to working with any Deputy who wants to contribute to the legislation and improve it in any way.  We look forward to constructive engagement as the Bill progresses.  While we would like to go much further in making provision for paid parental leave, Opposition parties are not in a position to do so under current rules.  This is, however, an important starting point and we urge Deputies to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400016#O03200","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":219,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491317100,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P00600","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491317100,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Sale of Illicit Goods Bill 2017: First Stage","time":1491317100,"counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to make it an offence to purchase illicit alcohol, illicit tobacco and illicit solid fuel; to make it an offence to purchase such goods from an unregistered or unlicensed retailer; to provide for the imposition of a penalty in respect of such offences; to provide for an on-the-spot fine in respect of such offences; and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>Is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir domsa &eacute; mo ch&eacute;ad Bhille, an Bille um Dh&iacute;ol Earra&iacute; Aindleatacha 2017, a chur ar aithne na D&aacute;la inniu.  I thank Deputies Robert Troy and John Lahart and Retailers Against Smuggling for their input and help in preparing this legislation.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the introduction of a series of new measures which are directed at tackling the trade in illegal alcohol, tobacco and solid fuel.  One of the key measures proposed is to make it an offence for a person to buy illicit alcohol, tobacco or solid fuel.  The Bill also makes it an offence for a person to buy alcohol, tobacco or solid fuel from an unregistered retailer.  In addition, it introduces an on-the-spot fine of &euro;100, which will be imposed where a person buys alcohol, tobacco or solid fuel which is illicit or from a retailer who is not registered or licensed.<\/p><p>Illicit trade in Ireland is estimated to have cost the Exchequer in excess of &euro;2.4 billion in 2015.  As I indicated, the Bill makes it an offence to purchase illicit alcohol, tobacco or solid fuel or to purchase alcohol, tobacco or solid fuel from an unregistered or unlicensed retailer.  It provides for the imposition of a penalty and an on-the-spot fine in respect of such offences.  A &euro;100 fine would apply for the following amounts: up to one litre of spirits, and each additional litre or part thereof; up to 200 cigarettes, and each additional 200 cigarettes or part thereof; up to 150 g of rolling tobacco, and each additional 150 g or part thereof; and up to 10 kg of solid fuel, and each additional 10 kg or part thereof.  <\/p><p>  The Bill contains 14 sections and is divided into five Parts, which I do not propose to discuss in detail at this stage.<\/p><p>Lower alcohol tax rates and excise duties in other jurisdictions fuel the smuggling of alcohol into Ireland.  The production and distribution of counterfeit spirits is also common.  A key driver for the illicit trade in tobacco products is the level of excise duty.  Criminals are attracted to the high profitability of this market as taxation policies in Ireland have given rise to opportunities for illegal traders to make profits by not paying domestic rates of duty.  From a demand perspective, increases in excise duties and taxes have driven up the final price of cigarette products, with the price of a pack of 20 cigarettes currently standing at almost &euro;11.  This has increased the demand for cheaper products supplied by the illicit market.<\/p><p>With regard to solid fuel, the introduction of the carbon tax in the Finance Act 2010 had the effect of increasing prices for fuel products throughout Ireland.  This has given rise to a sharp increase in the growth of illicit trade in solid fuel products such as coal, peat briquettes and sod peat.  Most of this activity involves cross-Border smuggling and the illegal import of solid fuel from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland.  The Bill provides a practical solution to the problem of trade in illicit goods.<\/p><p>Small shops are the lifeblood of local economies in towns and villages.  In an increasingly homogenised world we need to preserve our small local businesses as their distinctive character is what makes each town and village unique.  Locally owned businesses build strong communities and create more jobs in towns and villages.  For this reason, we need to protect small shop owners and businesses by creating a deterrent to stop members of the public buying from illegal sources.  The Bill makes it an offence to purchase such goods from an unregistered or unlicensed retailer and provides for the other offences I have outlined. <\/p><p>The effects of Brexit, including the significant weakening of sterling and concerns over possible customs and tariffs, will have a considerable knock-on impact on the level of illicit goods smuggled into Ireland.  I recognise that Revenue officials and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will need more resources to combat smuggling in the coming years because Brexit has created a political climate that is likely to make cross-Border smuggling more lucrative, with a fluctuating sterling and potential tariffs.  The Bill ensures that a major gap in the legislation surrounding illicit trade is closed.  We need to provide legislation in order that retailers and Revenue do not lose yet more money to criminals.  Every time a product such as tobacco, alcohol and solid fuel is purchased from an illegal source, not a single cent goes to the State, while the criminals involved in illegal smuggling get richer and richer.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P00900","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P01000","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":227,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P01100","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491317100,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P01300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P01400","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491317100,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Croatian Delegation","time":1491317100,"counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400017#P01600"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317100,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Before proceeding with business, I wish on my behalf and on behalf of the Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to offer a c&eacute;ad mile f&aacute;ilte, a most sincere welcome to Her Excellency, Mrs. Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107, President of Croatia, who visits us during her State visit to Ireland.

The date of the next meeting of the Cabinet committee has not yet been confirmed.<\/p>  <p>  I attended the Rome Summit on 25 March, as well as an audience with Pope Francis in the Vatican the previous evening.  On the morning of 25 March, the 27 EU Heads of State and Government met without the UK in the room where the Treaty of Rome had been signed in 1957. The event included speeches by the Italian hosts, the Maltese EU Presidency, and the presidents of the three EU Institutions.  There were no interventions from other Heads of State or Government.  We agreed to adopt and then formally signed the \"Rome Declaration\".  This short document highlights the important achievements of the EU over the past 60 years, the continuing importance of our shared values, and our commitment to addressing our future in a united and coherent way.<\/p>  <p>  In discussions leading up to the event in Rome, and during informal conversations in the margins, I stressed that the EU, founded on the rule of law, democracy and human rights, has delivered peace and prosperity across the continent, and that this is best preserved and promoted through the Union.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that, despite some differences, there was a strong sense of unity among EU leaders in Rome.  I also highlighted the need to focus on our core values, and to co-operate in areas where we agree, and where Europe can add value such as completing the Single Market and supporting jobs through trade.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I had no scheduled bilateral meetings in Rome.  However, I used the opportunity of the summit to engage with my EU counterparts and to reiterate Ireland's concerns arising from Brexit, specifically around Northern Ireland and the peace process, the common travel area, and our interwoven economies.  The UK triggered Article 50 on Wednesday 29 March.  Draft negotiating guidelines have since been circulated to member states, and I am pleased that these reflect Ireland's particular concerns, as, indeed, did Prime Minister May's letter to the European Council.  The draft guidelines will be further discussed at senior official and ministerial level over the next few weeks, with a view to agreeing them at a meeting of the European Council on 29 April.  We will continue our process of intensive engagement with member states and EU institutions during this period.<\/p>  <p>  I have not met bilaterally with Chancellor Merkel since Article 50 was triggered.  However, I will travel to Germany later this week, and am due to have a bilateral meeting with the Chancellor in Berlin on Thursday.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400018#Q00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1491317700,"counter":245,"content":"<p>The EU Council guidelines published last Friday reveal what I believe to have been a failure by the Government to stand up for Irish interests.  Article 11 deals with the island of Ireland, the peace process and the North, and it is vague and conditional.  It contracts starkly with Article 22, which deals with Spain and Gibraltar and gives a determining say to Spain on whether any trade deal beyond Brexit will apply to Gibraltar.  After Britain leaves the EU, any future trade deal that cannot be agreed until after Brexit will need the agreement of all members states but Spain is positioning itself by suggesting that the trade deal might only apply to Gibraltar in a situation of joint sovereignty between it and the British.  This has resulted in an outpouring of English jingoism not witnessed since the Brexit referendum campaign last summer.  Last weekend, former Tory leader, Michael Howard, evoked the memory of  Mrs. Thatcher and the possibility of war with Spain.  <i>The Daily Telegraph<\/i>went so far as to rush off to analyse which state had the better navy.

I do not have the exact date now but I will come back to the Deputy with it.<\/p>  <p>  I disagree with the Deputy that the document circulated by the EU in respect of the draft guidelines is a failure.  The guidelines are not a failure.  They include a very strong acknowledgement of our unique circumstances and special case, the need to protect the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and our intention to maintain bilateral arrangements with the UK such as in respect of the common travel area.  The draft guidelines will be circulated among the 27 member states.  The priorities which we have outlined for some time are also referred to specifically in the letter from Prime Minister May to President Tusk of the Council.  They are also referenced specifically in the European Parliament paper.  The Parliament has to give approval to the negotiated document at the end of the day.  From that point of view, chief negotiator Barnier, President Tusk of the Council, President Juncker of the Commission, Prime Minister May and the European Parliament all recognise Ireland's particular, special and unique circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  It is also fair to say that Gibraltar is a different case from Ireland.  Ireland and Northern Ireland, the peace process and the common travel area are all guaranteed by the Irish and British Governments under the Good Friday Agreement and an international legally binding treaty registered with the United Nations.  Gibraltar joined the EU with the UK and any change in the status of Gibraltar is a matter between the UK and the Kingdom of Spain.  That is a clear position, which is different from what applies here where we have a peace process, a Border, an international legally binding agreement and where the priorities outlined by the Government are contained in the EU draft guidelines, the British Prime Minister's letter and the European Parliament paper.

These are not soft assurances at all.  They are written, specific intentions from the British Prime Minister's point of view.  That is correlated on the other side by the very clear statement from the European Council.  The third element of that is the very clear statements from the European Parliament.  The European Parliament should not be forgotten here because it has to give its consent to the outcome of the negotiations.  Deputy Burton spoke of an all-Ireland dimension.  Deputy Howlin, the leader of Deputy Burton's party, spoke at both civic forums on an all-island basis and made a valuable contribution, as did many of the other party leaders.  There is no Executive at the moment in Northern Ireland.  I hope that can come together very quickly so that common objectives and the voice of the North can be heard at these discussions.  The opportunity for all-island solutions in respect of water, energy and animal health are all possible.  We have a specific set of unique circumstances that apply in the case of Ireland.  Deputy Burton also talked about slippage.  Unemployment today is at 6.4%, which is down from 15.2% when Deputy Burton and the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, took up duty in the previous Government.  It is an extraordinary change in a few short years.  There have never been more opportunities in so many ways for creating employment.  Brexit is a challenge.  It contains uncertainties but these are all matters for us to negotiate hard on.  As I have often said, we have prepared assiduously in so many ways with long-term low interest, by hedging forward and with extra trade missions and support for small companies exporting out of here.  We will treat this as a very serious matter in respect of the protection of our economy and our citizens' jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400019#R00700","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318300,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I am conscious there is a further debate on Brexit later today and tomorrow during which we can address in more detail the events of the past ten days.  Some of the points raised during the Treaty of Rome commemorations deserve comment.  In both the United Kingdom's notification and the draft negotiating position, it is fair to say that certain of Ireland's concerns are addressed.  It is welcome that no one appears to be in favour of a hard Border but everything else is up for negotiation.  We have not really had a definition or fleshing out of what people mean by a hard Border versus any other kind of border.  One major point of concern is the failure of the United Kingdom Government to propose any provisions which might be specific to devolved governments.  Not only is special status for Northern Ireland not proposed, it appears to be explicitly ruled out.  It is looking at a pan-British approach to the relationship with the European Union.  Crucially it omits to mention that 1.8 million people in Northern Ireland will retain the right to European Union citizenship irrespective of the settlement.  There are a series of issues that we would like to see addressed in more detail in the European Union's negotiating document.  The most important is that it must acknowledge the unique position of Northern Ireland and its citizens.  Will the Taoiseach commit to seeking an acknowledgement of the EU citizenship of residents of Northern Ireland post-2019 in the EU's negotiating document?  It is a simple question.

I want to see in the negotiated outcome the language of the portion of the Good Friday Agreement relevant to the future opportunity that may present itself in Northern Ireland.  As the visionaries of the Good Friday Agreement foresaw, there may be a time when the people vote to have a united Ireland.  The language of the Good Friday Agreement that allows for that should be included as part of the negotiated outcome so in that eventuality, Northern Ireland would not then be asked to trigger Article 49 to rejoin the European Union.  It would be allowed to do so in a seamless transition in the same way as East Germany was able to form the federal republic with West Germany when the Berlin Wall came down.  It is important.  For those who drafted the Good Friday Agreement, it was quite a visionary thing to put in because that time may come.  It will be important that the negotiations include that language as the continuation of the vision and foresight of those who drafted the Good Friday Agreement in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400019#R00900","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318300,"counter":257,"content":"<p>By way of clarification, the Taoiseach said the Government will publish a detailed list of actions.

A weekend report in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>claimed that the Government was afraid that Irish companies would relocate to Britain to avoid tariffs and currency risks.  It also claimed to have received a series of internal Government documents under freedom of information request that showed the breadth of the Government's concerns across a range of sectors, including fishing, research, forestry and agrifood.  Apparently, one of the documents revealed the Government's concern about the possibility that, post Brexit, Britain would be in a better position to attract foreign direct investment.  Is that true?<\/p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's briefing notes warn that this State faces &quot;a very uncertain situation related to the management and sharing of a large number of different fish stocks&quot;.  The British fishing industry wants to exclude all foreign boats, including Irish ones, from its fisheries zone after Brexit.

I accept my responsibilities as Taoiseach in terms of the negotiating mandate and requirement that we have here, and that is why I have kept the Opposition party leaders fully briefed on the preparations for Brexit in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  It is true, and I agree with the Deputy, that we have never been down this road before.  Nobody has moved Article 50.  Nobody has left the European Union.  This is going to have an impact, not just nationally or internationally, but also globally, and it will have an impact on the economies of the island of Ireland.  That is why it is very important that the Deputy's own party would work with the other parties in the North and put together the Executive, which will speak for the economic aspects and the businesses and the trade unions and the workers in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Yes, I think it is probably true that, over the last number of years, there have been Irish firms that set up subsidiaries or relocated some of their enterprises in Britain long before Brexit ever came.  It is also true that, in respect of the interest being expressed in Ireland from financial houses, banks or sectors of them, they are very interested in relocating to Ireland.  Many have multiple units at the moment.  They will want to continue to be part of the Single Market.  They have the second highest busiest route in the world, with connectivity, English language speakers and access to a churn of young talent, which is very important in terms of the products and services that are going to be provided in the future.  Clearly, we have lost &euro;500 million in value terms, because of currency fluctuations, in the drinks and food industry, and Enterprise Ireland has been very conscious of this.<\/p>  <p>  Fish stocks will probably be one of the most complicated arguments of all.  The Common Fisheries Policy is not something that can be unravelled in individual segments because it has been a traded business over very many years when some countries had no real interest in their fisheries potential, including ourselves, I have to say.  While it might be very much in Britain's interests that Brexit would suit it, in that a majority of the quota is caught in British waters, clearly there will be some very complicated negotiations to be held about the fisheries industry and fishery stocks in the time ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400020#S02400","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318900,"counter":289,"content":"<p>Clearly, agriculture has suffered some difficulties in the context of an approaching Brexit.  This applies in some areas of agribusiness, most notably the mushroom trade, which was partly brought on by changes in the value of sterling.  There are other issues, not just with fishing, but also tourism.  For the first time in a long while, tourism figures have fallen somewhat, although hopefully not much more.  Much of this relates to changes in the value of sterling, with people who have been planning a break in, for example, County Donegal finding that their pound sterling does not go as far.<\/p>  <p>  I am asked a certain question all of the time.  I am sure that other Members are as well.  What, if anything, is the Government doing to help businesses in agriculture, tourism and so on?  I have read everything from Enterprise Ireland and the IDA and I know that the Taoiseach and Ministers have run a series of conferences, but the Taoiseach just pointed to a key issue.  Notwithstanding his acknowledgement that certain areas face difficulties, he referred to Ireland potentially attracting new banking jobs to Dublin, for example, but that is exactly what the crisis is going to be about.  Jobs are leaving rural Ireland and tourism areas on the west coast, including in the north west, are facing falls.  Those who work in the west and the rest of rural Ireland in fishing, farming, agribusiness, mushrooms in Monaghan or elsewhere will not get those banking jobs in Dublin or Cork city.

The Wild Atlantic Way is a concept that has caught on.  The lakelands and the midlands districts are seeing a huge surge of interest from abroad, as is Ireland's Ancient East.  The Norwegian decision to fly from Cork, Shannon, Belfast and Dublin will do for long haul what Ryanair did for short haul.  I expect seriously increased numbers to come in.  Clearly, Ireland is seen as a very attractive location from a hospitality point of view.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, on the broader scene we are making a joint bid for the rugby world cup for 2023.  Advance preparation is very much in train there.  The British Open will be coming here in 2019.  The Irish Open will for one in three years go to Northern Ireland.  The opportunities for the hospitality sector are very strong.  It should be remembered that the Minister for Finance reduced the VAT rate during the Deputy's own time in Government, from 13.5% to 9%.  That is oftentimes forgotten, but not only did it sustain the industry, it created between 35,000 and 50,000 new jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Unemployment is at 6.4% today.  This is almost full employment, as the Deputy recognises.  That trend was in the downward direction when both she and Deputy Howlin were in the previous Government.  I see Microsoft and Indeed here in Dublin, NGINX in Cork, Allergan in Westport, multiple announcements of jobs in the Limerick area, and the advance factories in Sligo, Athlone, Castlebar and Tralee being completed and seriously investigated in terms of employment opportunities.<\/p><p>These are opportunities here for foreign directive investment.  That line of investment continues to be strong.  When I was in the United States recently I came across many people interested in following through either on initial assessments or existing investments here.  When I was in Davos earlier in the year with the Minister for Finance we met 20 chief executives, many of whom are looking seriously at Ireland in terms of investment.  On the other hand, we have given Enterprise Ireland additional resources, staff and facilities to help small and medium enterprises to export.  There were 100 trade missions abroad this year.  We can sell far more in the eurozone, the Nordic countries and beyond.  These are opportunities in respect of which we are working hard with the ministries for trade and diplomatic services.

In that context, has the Cabinet Committee on the Economy, Trade and Jobs commissioned or produced a position paper or analysis on the impact on trade of a hard Brexit and has it undertaken a sector by sector analysis in terms of the impact of the British decision to leave the European Union?  We have some idea of the likely impact on the agrifood sector.  The Taoiseach referenced fishing rights in terms of our capacity to fish our quota, a significant amount of which currently takes place in British waters.  It seems to me that we cannot take our eye off the ball in terms of trade.

As the Deputy will be aware, work in respect of the cross-city Luas project is ongoing, as is work on connecting bridges and extension of the DART line.

These are the issues on which we are following through.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Martin's question, all of the options have been examined.  The Deputy is correct that trade is the issue.  In regard to the negotiations that are to take place the nature of the trading relationship is still not clear.  The document from President Tusk is going through the 27 and will be signed off on, hopefully, on 29 April.  The document sets out the ground work and foundations of what will happen.  This goes back to the issue of full membership of the Customs Union, partial membership of the Customs Union, no deal and the consequences of that for tariffs, as pointed out by the Deputy.  In terms of where we are now, the letter triggering Article 50 has been put in place; an initial response has been issued by the European Union and the foundation document on the discussions and negotiations that will take place has been issued.  It remains to be seen what the eventual outcome will be.<\/p>  <p>  We launched the new trade, tourism and investment strategy entitled, Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World.  We have also made it clear that 135,000 of the 200,000 to be created by 2020 will be outside the Dublin region.  In regard to Deputy Haughey's point that Dublin is not ready for Brexit, I know there will be serious investment here by the different financial sectors but it will not all happen in 18 months.  A bank deciding to locate here will have to go through a regulatory process in regard to licensing and so on.  The Minister for Finance has made arrangements for the European Central Bank to provide expert personnel if that is needed.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the ports issue raised by Deputy Howlin, the Minister has already pointed out that following the opening of the European Investment Bank office in Dublin there are opportunities here for major pieces of infrastructure and there will be an income stream to deal with those loans.  Again, much depends on the trading relationship and whether tariffs will apply at ports because that could change the economic model of the port to be involved.

An issue seems to have arisen with litigation-based insurance, such as employer liability and public liability insurance, because of the lack of predictability and the inconsistency in court awards.  In some cases, businesses are taking the risk of not having any insurance at all.  They are being forced to take that crazy risk so that they can stay in business.

However, such services are part of the viability of businesses in the first place, therefore they cannot portion out that part of their business.<\/p>  <p>  The work we have done to date has identified particular problems, to which the Deputy alluded, regarding certain businesses taking on higher excesses which is difficult for them in terms of managing their bottom line.  Self-insurance is on the increase.  Businesses involved in self-insuring could be putting their entire business at risk if they encounter a problem in the future against which they had not provisioned.  It is a worrying trend.<\/p>  <p>  We are also considering the role brokers might be able to play and expanding the terms of reference to include that.  Fraud is also important.  We are receiving very good information from businesses on how fraud is affecting their businesses.<\/p>  <p>  We need to examine issues in order to bring greater consistency to this area, such as the personal injuries commission that has been set up already and is working, strengthening the PIAB and in the second quarter of this year, the changes to the legislation on that.

The creation of ISIF was a commitment in the last Government's programme for Government.  The previous Government gave ISIF a unique double bottom line mandate to invest on a commercial basis in a manner designed to support economic activity and employment in Ireland.  This mandate sought to demonstrate that the State was prepared to invest its limited investment funds in projects that would yield a commercial return, thus demonstrating its confidence in the future of the Irish economy.  The intention of this investment was to leverage additional private sector investment, which I am pleased to state has been higher than expected to date.<\/p><p>Given ISIF's new and unique mandate as a sovereign development fund and because of the uncertainty regarding investment opportunities in Ireland, it was agreed at the time that a formal review of the ISIF investment strategy would take place after 18 months.  This was to allow a sufficient period of time to elapse before considering the operations and impact of the fund.  The investment strategy review which is due to be completed shortly is examining the performance and impact of ISIF.  The review includes an appraisal of the success of ISIF's mandate to the end of December 2016 and requires engagement by both my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the process.<\/p><p>I am sure the Deputy shares my view that ISIF's double bottom line mandate represents a unique strategic opportunity for Ireland.  The mandate is designed to ensure that ISIF's investment generates a return, attracts investors and recycles funds.  Without wanting in any way to pre-empt the review that is currently under way, I am encouraged by the quality and impact on the Irish economy of ISIF's investments.  ISIF has built up momentum already, including through its future pipeline.  ISIF has already committed &euro;2.7 billion and acts as a catalyst for other investors to invest in Irish projects.  This includes a commitment of &euro;361 million for infrastructure investment essential to the future competitiveness of the economy.  In addition, ISIF's ability to attract co-investment from the private sector means that &euro;7 billion of total investment has been committed to the end of December 2016.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>It is apparent from the investments already in the public domain that, as envisaged at inception, ISIF is utilising its unique investment characteristics of scale, long-term perspective and flexibility to target high economic value investment in Ireland in a way that other funds cannot.  ISIF has made investments in the following key economic sectors, namely, housing and construction, SME credit, venture capital and equity funds, connectivity, renewable energy, water provision, forestry and agriculture.  The fact that the proceeds of ISIF investment can, unlike State spending, also be recycled to support future economic activity in Ireland illustrates the potential that the ISIF model offers and on which ISIF is currently delivering.  I look forward to receiving the ISIF investment strategy review as it will be a useful opportunity to consider ISIF's work to date and the most appropriate use of the fund to help meet the forthcoming challenges that the State faces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400024#W00100","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1491321300,"counter":353,"content":"<p>At the end of 2016, the fund's global portfolio was &euro;6.65 billion.

When I look at the investments to date, some of them are very good.  Some of them are quite niche in nature, however, and it is clear that more mainstream investments which can meet the terms of the commercial mandate should be explored.  For example, is there more we can do in relation to investment in broadband through ISIF?  There are many unbuilt roads nationally which we know are to be tolled.  Would they meet the terms of the commercial mandate?  Similarly, a certain amount of housing has been provided in partnership with funds.  Should we be doing more in that area?  Public transport passengers pay fares and, as such, investments in this area can be commercial if they are properly constituted.  We should be doing more across all of those areas.

The public private model has worked to some extent.  ISIF has made significant progress and I am sure it is aware of this debate today.

I am aware of the report which was published by Oxfam on 27 March.  The report makes a number of comments about the level of tax paid by certain banks in respect of their operations in each country of operation, including Ireland.  The report also asserts that 31 different jurisdictions, including Ireland, should be considered tax havens.  I understand that the report relies on publicly available data published by banks under the capital requirements directive, CRD IV.  The report takes this data and uses it to assert the effective tax rate suffered by banks in the countries in which they operate.  While I will not comment on the tax affairs of individual taxpayers, there are a number of reasons that using this data to assert a company's effective tax rate may create a misleading picture.<\/p>  <p>  Calculating a company's effective tax rate requires looking at a company's profits as calculated under Irish tax law and the amount of tax charged on those profits under Irish tax law.  This information is not included in the public country-by-country reports.  For this reason, caution is needed when using the country-by-country information when commenting on a company's tax affairs.  For example, the profit figures filed in the CRD IV reports generally relate to profit calculated for accounting purposes.  Companies, however, do not pay tax on their accounting profits, but rather on their taxable profits.  There are a variety of legitimate differences in how these figures are calculated in each country.<\/p><p>For example, all capital expenditure is treated differently for accounting and tax calculations. <br\/><br\/>Similarly, the tax on profit or loss figure in the publicly disclosed information may relate to tax actually paid over to Revenue rather than the tax charge suffered by the company.  For example, where a company has losses carried forward from a previous year, this would reduce the amount of tax that must be paid over but does mean the company is not subject to a tax charge on its profits.<br\/><br\/>Officials in my Department are examining the report in more detail and have arranged a meeting with Oxfam to discuss the report's contents.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>I would like to point out that all companies in Ireland pay the standard 12.5% rate on their trading profits which are generated in Ireland.  Higher rates of 25% and 33% apply to certain profits.  My Department has previously worked with Mr Seamus Coffey, who is currently conducting a review on the corporation tax code, on a technical paper to provide clarity about the seemingly conflicting figures and methodologies for the effective rate of tax paid by companies in Ireland.  This paper found that the effective rate paid nationally is between 10.3% and 10.7%.<br\/><br\/>I strongly reject the report's suggestion that Ireland is a tax haven.  There is no clear analysis as to why Ireland would be considered as such and we do not meet any of the vague criteria that the report suggests are indicative of tax havens.  The report itself notes that international institutions, such as the IMF and OECD, do not consider Ireland to be a tax haven.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400024#W00900","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491321900,"counter":362,"content":"<p>As the Minister knows, and he has been quite concerned about it, Ireland's reputation on tax is a very tricky issue, particularly in the context of Brexit.

We are then talking to other companies that are not directly financial services companies themselves, but an element of their business is significant enough that they have a subsidiary that might be operating in a particular area, for example, for payments.<\/p>  <p>  We have the IFS2020 strategy,  which is a five-year strategy for increasing our international financial services offering.  We worked with industry to develop that strategy.  As a result of having that strategy in place since 2015, it meant we were ahead of the game in attracting financial services firms into Ireland to allow that continuity of service into the Single Market.  Not every company that relocates out of the UK is going to come here.  We have to be honest about this.  There is going to be a flow to this.  From the meetings I have already had and from the decisions that have already been taken by companies, there will be a strong flow to Ireland.  It is up to the companies themselves to decide when they want to notify the public, their customers, their staff, shareholders and regulators in jurisdictions in which they are currently based.  When they do that, then we will be in a position to comment publicly about that.  Companies will be relocating here, but they will also relocate to other jurisdictions in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400026#Y00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1491322500,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Here is the fear.

It still says two plays, which is FinTech and another one, which escapes me.  Brexit presents a big opportunity, which is now different, which is to say that we are not just going to try to get insurance companies, reinsurance companies, trading firms and so forth.  There is a real opportunity to say that we can bring the entire ecosystem over to Dublin or wherever it sets up in Ireland.  One of the reasons London is so strong is because it has the full ecosystem.<\/p>  <p>  A core piece of this is the infrastructure.  The fear from financial services players in Dublin is that we might bring some of these firms over, but because we do not create a sustainable infrastructure around them, in time they might move to Luxembourg, Frankfurt or elsewhere.  The information I have from very well-placed people within the industry is that the infrastructure firms are not being approached by the State and need to be.  The infrastructure firms are saying that they are being wined and dined by the French, the Belgians and the Spanish and by Luxembourg, and they are not seeing sight nor sound of the Irish.  Nobody is saying that the Minister of State is not busy.  We know he is busy.  My sense is that we could be more strategic, more clever and have a strategy that encompasses the full ecosystem so that when we get these firms over here, they stay here and grow rather than relocating here temporarily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400026#Y00300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1491322500,"counter":384,"content":"<p>We share the same ambition here.

It is part of the strategy that we are developing to make sure that every opportunity that might come from Brexit is there and available to us to take advantage of.  Companies will make relocation decisions based on a number of factors.  We have heard we are coming in the top three of companies' potential relocation options across the board.  They will pull a trigger for this jurisdiction, but they will also pull it for other jurisdictions and for other legacy reasons, for example.  One big international bank has decided to go to Paris.  It made sense because a legacy acquisition 12 years ago meant it already had the authorisation for its banking licencee.  If one looks at the action plan for 2017 under the IFS2020 strategy, there are two component parts.  The first component part is the Brexit narrative, talking about contingency planning, communications, the Central Bank piece in this and other areas like International Baccalaureate education and what we need to do.  The second part is the 40 individual action points and how we are going to address them just in this year alone.  There is the matter of IFS and how we plan to grow it for the year.  Some points are very Brexit-related and some are less directly so.  <\/p>  <p>  No one individual ecosystem in international financial services is going to relocate to another jurisdiction.  In insurance, for example, not all insurance companies are going to go to one place and it is good that they do not.  It is good that they operate from different jurisdictions, in different markets into the Single Market when they can.  The skill-set and having the people here are very important to us.  That is why one of the pillars of those 40 action points in the IFS strategy for this year is looking at education, trading and skills development, and also attracting Irish emigrants back home into these high-level jobs that are being created, not just in Dublin but also Cork and other parts of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400026#Y00400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Other Questions","time":1491322500,"counter":385,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400026#Y00450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Debt","time":1491322500,"counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400026#Y00475"},{"type":"question","time":1491322500,"counter":387,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[16418\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400026#Y00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has held discussions recently with the NTMA in relation to the national debt repayments which will fall due in 2018 to 2020; his views on the fact that a quarter of Ireland's national debt is due for refinancing in that period; the way this will impact the fiscal position; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The total balance outstanding on these bonds is currently just over &euro;42 billion.  In addition, the majority of the bilateral loans received from the UK, Sweden and Denmark as part of the EU-IMF programme also mature during that period.  This brings the total medium-term to long-term debt refinancing requirement over that three year period to approximately &euro;46.5 billion.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that although there are two loans from the European financial stabilisation mechanism, EFSM, totalling &euro;3.9 billion, with contractual maturity dates in 2018, these are due to be refinanced by the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, in light of the maturity extensions granted to EFSM and European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, loans in 2013.

The expectation is that these bonds can be refinanced at lower coupons based on the current interest rate outlook.  The current interest expenditure forecast reflects this expectation.  For the period of 2018 to 2020, refinancing requirements have already been significantly reduced in recent years.\u00a0 Following the early repayments to the IMF of December 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 and their replacement with cheaper long-term market-based funding, the liability to the IMF in that three-year period has been reduced by approximately &euro;11.5 billion.  The maturity extensions granted to EFSF and EFSM loans in 2013 and bilateral bond switching have also helped to reduce the refinancing requirements over that period by over &euro;7 billion.  The NTMA has also built up significant cash balances as part of its pre-funding strategy.

However, the European Union excise regime which governs the production, processing and holding of excisable products imposes certain restrictions on intra-Union movements of these products.  These restrictions impact on the importation of mineral oils for vehicle and household use from Northern Ireland.  The EU excise regime governing the movement of excisable products, that is mineral oils, tobacco products and alcohol, does not apply to solid fuels such as coal and, as a result, solid fuel is not subject to cross-Border movement controls typical of other harmonised excises such as mineral oil tax and tobacco tax. <\/p><p>I will deal firstly with the importation from Northern Ireland of mineral oils for use as vehicle and household fuels.  Persons bringing mineral oil fuel for vehicles into the State from Northern Ireland must pay excise duty, that is mineral oil tax, on that fuel except where the fuel is present in the fuel tank of a vehicle at the time that vehicle is brought into the State or where the fuel is in a single portable vessel with a capacity of not more than 10 litres that is in that vehicle at the time of coming into the State, and where the proper UK excise duty applicable to the use of that fuel in the vehicle involved has been paid in that jurisdiction.<\/p><p>Persons bringing mineral oil into the State for use other than as road vehicle fuel, for example for heating use or for agricultural tractors or stationary motors, must pay the mineral oil tax on that fuel.  In the case of gas oil or kerosene, where a person wishes to pay only the reduced rate applicable to those fuels when intended for use other than as road fuel, the oil must be marked with the fuel markers prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p>All commercial movements of mineral oil into the State from Northern Ireland are subject to a movement control system.\u00a0 Movements of duty-suspended mineral oil are subject to\u00a0an EU-wide electronic system, known as the excise movement control system.  In the case of movements of duty-paid oils, such movements may only take place under an equivalent paper-based control method.  Where a person intends to sell or deal in mineral oils the appropriate mineral oil trader's licence, issued by the Revenue Commissioners, must be held.  Other control measures include obligations on oil traders to provide detailed information on their fuel transactions to Revenue.  This allows Revenue to monitor mineral oil supply chains to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution for investigation.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>I am satisfied that the current restrictions on the importation of oil for vehicle and household use are comprehensive and support Revenue in tackling any issues regarding the illegal importation of mineral oil.<\/p><p>I will now deal with the importation of solid fuel, and specifically coal, into the State from Northern Ireland.  All solid fuel supplied in the State is liable to solid fuel carbon tax.  This tax was legislated for in 2010 but its commencement was delayed until 2013 to allow for a mechanism to be put in place to address the risk of coal products with lower environmental standards being sourced from outside the State.  Regulations to enable local authorities to regulate and control the type of coal supplied in the State were put in place by the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and are now the responsibility of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p><p>As I already explained, EU law does not require compliance with movement controls for solid fuels for excise duty purposes.  Therefore, no excise movement controls apply to imports of solid fuel from Northern Ireland, whether by private persons for their own use or by traders or businesses for commercial purposes.  Revenue collects solid fuel carbon tax on a self-assessment basis and enforces compliance by way of audit.  Excise law does not give Revenue an authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel.  Similarly, the transport or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland are not, in themselves, Revenue offences and Revenue's officers have no authority to challenge such transportation or possession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400028#AA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1491323700,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his answer.

Some agreements were reached between the Northern Ireland authorities and our Department of Justice and Equality to deal with the issues on an all-Ireland basis and I welcome these.  I understand that a standard truck carrying 20 tonnes of coal from Northern Ireland to the South, without the application of carbon tax and with a differential in VAT, gives an advantage of more than &euro;2,000 to the person conducting the illicit trade.  It is very hard for the legitimate merchant and retailer to compete.  Hardware Association Ireland has put forward some suggestions to the Revenue Commissioners and to the Department, such as the registration of all solid fuel traders provided for in the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015, which requires a valid tax clearance certificate for such traders to register.  The association also called for a public awareness campaign to let the public who buy these cheaper products know that they are illicit and that carbon tax or the proper rate of VAT has not been paid in our jurisdiction.  Hardware Association Ireland also recommends very thorough audits by Revenue on the people involved in this illicit trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400028#AA01000","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1491323700,"counter":408,"content":"<p>My initial reply dealt exclusively with controls on the importation of fossil fuels.  The collection of solid fuel carbon tax is heavily reliant on the regulatory regime for solid fuel put in place by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.

These environmental standards are higher than those that apply in Northern Ireland.  The regulations provide for the enforcement of the relevant environmental standards by local authorities.  Local authorities have powers to inspect premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel, to collect samples of coal to check for adherence to environmental standards and to prosecute traders involved in selling illicit coal.

At budget time, my officials estimated that the help-to-buy incentive would cost &euro;40 million per annum but &euro;50 million in 2017 due to the backdating of the relief in respect of properties which became eligible for the scheme since 19 July 2016.<\/p>  <p>  To avail of the incentive involves two stages.  Stage 1 is the application stage, wherein prospective applicants can query whether they qualify for the incentive.  They can also get clarity on the maximum amount of rebate they could potentially benefit from, based on their tax paid in a four-year period.  Stage 2 is the claims stage, wherein applicants who decide to proceed with purchasing or building a qualifying property must provide documentary evidence of the relevant property transaction or their mortgage drawdown.<\/p>  <p>  The estimates for the potential cost of the incentive that have featured in recent media reports are based on the number of applications received by Revenue to stage 1 of the scheme, rather than the number of claims to date.  However, many of these applicants may never make a claim to stage 2 for a variety of reasons.  These could include individuals who do not go on to obtain mortgage approval, who may decide to purchase a second-hand property, or who are not able to source the new home that they desire.<\/p>  <p>  As of 31 March 2017, Revenue had received 4,698 applications to stage 1 of the help-to-buy incentive.  Of these, 1,006 stage 2 claims have been created to date.  A total of 534 of these have been approved, at an estimated cost to the Exchequer to date in the order of &euro;8.2 million of the &euro;50 million allocated for the cost of the incentive in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's query concerning cost containment measures, the help-to-buy incentive is by its nature a demand-led scheme.  Therefore, artificially restricting its potential uptake in such a manner would be detrimental to its policy aims and would be unfair to those potential applicants who could lose out as a result.  In addition, should the cost of the incentive exceed the original estimate, it could be indicative of an increase in the supply of new homes, which is exactly what I intended to encourage through its introduction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400029#BB00700","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1491324300,"counter":416,"content":"<p>Over the past 48 hours since the two reports have been published, households have been asking if we are in some kind of time warp.

Since the scheme is for people principally buying starter homes, then it is an incentive to put a deposit together.

This will attract foreign direct investment into Ireland and will create a substantial number of jobs.<\/p><p>NAMA has made a significant contribution to social and economic development in other respects also.  I refer the Deputy to NAMA's website, <i>www. nama.ie\/social-initiatives\/<\/i>,which contains extensive information on how NAMA seeks to manage its portfolio in a manner that complements the objectives of Government Departments, local authorities, State agencies and public bodies.\u00a0 NAMA's work in this respect includes the provision of homes for social housing and properties for schools and other public uses.  NAMA also works closely with IDA Ireland to identify suitable properties for companies investing in Ireland.  All this has been managed in the context of NAMA's overriding commercial mandate, as set out in section 10 of the NAMA Act.\u00a0 <\/p><p>NAMA has made\u00a0a substantial contribution in the social housing sector by working with its debtors and receivers, the Housing Agency, local authorities and approved housing bodies.  It established the NAMA asset residential property service, NARPS, as\u00a0an innovative model to expedite social housing delivery. \u00a0NARPS has significantly reduced the upfront capital costs for local\u00a0authorities in delivering to date more than 2,370 residential units for social housing.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>NAMA also played a key role in the resolution of unfinished housing estates within the State. \u00a0In 2010 NAMA had exposure to 332 unfinished housing estates.  That has now reduced to 11 unfinished estates at this stage and they are expected to be resolved by end-2017.<\/p><p>I would also\u00a0point out\u00a0that NAMA is seeking to facilitate the delivery of 20,000 homes over the period from 2016 to 2020, subject to commercial viability. \u00a0Since 2014, NAMA funding has facilitated the delivery of 4,700 units by its debtors and receivers.<\/p><p>As regards the Deputy's question as to the obligations on purchasers to build homes, I am advised that NAMA contributes to the delivery of housing in three ways.  First, as mentioned above, it seeks to facilitate and fund the delivery of 20,000 homes by 2020 through funding residential projects controlled by its debtors and receivers.  Second, its debtors and receivers sell sites to the market which enables other developers to contribute to housing delivery.  Sites for 40,000 units have been sold since 2010.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is not possible to impose legal obligations on asset purchasers to undertake activity without significant loss in the site values.  Third, NAMA enters into licence arrangements with non-NAMA developers which require them to carry out development on sites securing NAMA loans in return for a fee.<\/p><p>Taken together,\u00a0I hope the Deputy will agree that NAMA has made, and continues to make, a significant contribution to the social and economic development of the State and that it does so successfully within the context of NAMA's overriding commercial mandate, as set out in section 10 of the NAMA Act.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware,\u00a0does not own property.\u00a0\u00a0owns loans. \u00a0As a\u00a0lender,\u00a0cannot force a borrower to take action which would reduce his or her repayment capacity such as providing a property for\u00a0social\u00a0or private\u00a0housing where that is not economically optimal.\u00a0 To do so would compromise a borrower's\u00a0capacity to repay his or her debts to\u00a0and would constitute\u00a0a direct breach of the borrower's property rights, as protected under Article 43 of the Constitution. \u00a0I am advised that a direction running counter to these obligations is not one lawfully open to me in all the current circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400030#CC03200","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1491324900,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Section 2(<i>b<\/i>)(viii) of the NAMA Act provides that NAMA should &quot;contribute to the social and economic development of the State&quot;.

This is less than five months from now, which means time is short.  Parents are concerned by what they consider to be a lack of certainty and progress on the school.  I have repeatedly raised this issue and pressed the Department and Minister to progress the matter.  I understand the Minister has on his desk sufficient information to make a decision on who will be the patron of the school.  Will he identify the patron to allow it to proceed with the establishment of the school?<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of population growth in Ballincollig in recent years, a new school was announced in November 2015.  In September 2015, 448 children enrolled in the town's schools, one of which accepted 94 children and refused almost as many again.  Despite this, the next step in the process was not taken until one year later, in November 2016, when expressions of interest were invited to potential patrons.  Three patron groups submitted applications by 6 January 2017 and the new school establishment group has been reviewing these submissions in the intervening months.  In response to a question I asked the Minister in late February, he indicated a decision on patronage was due within weeks.  One month later, a decision has not been made and the school is due to open in less than five months.  A great deal of work must be done before September.  Staff must be hired and an open and transparent hiring process will add a number of weeks to the process.  The building must be finished and enrolments taken, which mean the timetable is very tight.<\/p>  <p>  The position in Ballincollig contrasts strongly with the position of the fourth school in the same school bundle, which is located in south central Dublin.  The Dublin school will have 18 months to do the same work as the school in Ballincollig.  The new school establishment group has made a recommendation, which is on the Minister's desk.  Will he release the name of the patron and allow the patron to establish the school?  Locals are concerned and have been outlining their concerns when they call into my office in Ballincollig or meet me on the street.<\/p><p>They are asking what is the story with the school and whether there will be a place for their child in September, which is less than five months away.  If they have expressed interest in another patron that is not approved, will there be a place for them in the new school?<\/p> <p> The school is only taking in one junior infants class.  What happens if there is more demand than that?  If a second class is required, will provision be made?  What will happen regarding children with special educational needs?  The Department is currently amending the way in which support for them is allocated.  How will SNA supports be allocated for the new school in Ballincollig?  Will it be done using the old model or via the new model using a baseline and profile of the area?  Given the tight timeframe, it is expected a temporary building will be in use from September.  How long with the children be in this building and what facilities will be available to them?  Will there be playgrounds, green areas and so on?  How soon will the new eight classroom permanent school be built and occupied?  These are realistic questions that are concerning for parents and they cannot approach a school authority to get answers.<\/p> <p> The New Schools Establishment Group, NSEG, has been reviewing the bundle of four schools for the past three months.  Three submissions were made regarding Ballincollig.  They have been reviewed and are on the Minister's desk.  Can he release the Ballincollig decision in order that the school can be developed?  That would clear up much of the uncertainty that is troubling parents.  It would mean the patron could finalise the details of the school building and offer places to children and it would mean parents would know where they stand.  There are less than five months remaining for the school to be opened and parents have numerous concerns.

As he rightly recognised, my Department conducted a study of the demographic pressures throughout the country and indicated that four new primary schools and nine new post-primary schools were justified.  Under the procedure operated within my Department, when it is identified that there is a demographic need, the Department runs a patronage process to decide who will operate the school.  The criteria used in respect of patronage of the new school place particular emphasis on parental demand for plurality and diversity of patronage, with parental preferences from the area to be served being central to the process.  In this regard, patrons and prospective patrons must collect and demonstrate evidence of parental demand from the area to be served for the model of provision proposed as part of their application under the process.  My Department invited applications for the patronage last November and that closed for applications in January.  The assessment stage of the process is rigorous and detailed and it has go through all the applications, identify whether they are within the catchment and so on.<\/p>  <p>  Once completed, draft assessment reports will be forwarded for the consideration of the NSEG, which is an external independent advisory group set up to oversee the process.  Contrary to what the Deputy said, the report has not arrived on my desk.  Following its consideration, the NSEG will submit a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  I will then announce who the successful patron of each of the four schools will be.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations will be available on my Department's website following the announcement.<\/p>  <p>  I reassure the Deputy that care has to be taken in these matters because when there is a competition between different patrons, it has to be conducted in a fair and balanced way and, therefore, the time has to be taken to do that.  I recognise the concerns of parents regarding the delay.  However, the memorandum of understanding between my Department and the County and City Managers' Association helps us to identify sites for educational use.  My Department has been working closely with Cork County Council towards acquiring a permanent site to meet the needs of the new primary school for Ballincollig.  A number of potentially suitable sites were identified and were comprehensively technically assessed.  Further consideration is now being given to a preferred site option with a view to advancing the acquisition process.<\/p>  <p>  Given the commercial sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally, the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment further at this time.  Officials from my Department will be in contact with the relevant school authorities to inform them of the permanent location for the school once the site acquisition process has been completed.  A project for the new primary school is included in my Department's six-year capital programme.  Once a site is acquired, my Department will make the necessary arrangements to advance the school project concerned into architectural planning with a view to progressing the project to tender and construction during the period 2019-21, as outlined in the programme.  In the meantime the school will open in September 2017 in suitable interim temporary accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of special education needs and how SNA allocations will be made to the school, I will revert to the Deputy as that was not covered in the briefing material, given it is a new enrolment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400032#EE00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1491326100,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Less than five months remain until the school opens in September.

Those Deputies are hiding behind and, at the same time, backing the Minister, Deputy Ross, in his attempts to run our public transport network into the ground to suit his agenda of privatisation.  Public transport, like education and housing, is a public service.  There are hundreds of thousands of people who depend on public transport on a daily basis.<\/p>  <p>  If the talks at the WRC do not work out and if the Minister persists with his agenda of privatisation and a race to the bottom of workers' rights the result will be the mother of all strikes.  The Minister and the Government will be directly responsible for the chaos that will ensue when that happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040400035#HH00800","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1491327900,"counter":515,"content":"<p>The Minister's reply is incredibly contradictory.  His statement that he has intervened to secure increased funding for socially necessary transport and free travel and that he is reviewing the commercial bus licensing system indicates that he knows he has a key role in the future of our public transport system.  The workers and management negotiating need to know these facts.  The Minister is the only person who can give them that information.  He has a cheek to talk about productivity.  Since 2009-2010, when Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael set up the current system of bus licensing which got us into the situation we are in today, there have been massive increases in productivity by bus workers in Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Irish Rail despite savage cuts in pay and staff numbers.

He is now acknowledging that as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, he is up to his neck in it.  It is a bit ironic for him to say that ministerial intervention is never required in industrial disputes given that not so long ago, the threat of a blue flu by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na led his Government to intervene by finding &euro;40 million to settle the issue.  The provision of that &euro;40 million was announced by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  It is wrong to say that Ministers do not intervene, as I have mentioned a case in which there was ministerial intervention.  Why does the Minister think garda&iacute; are more important as public servants than bus drivers?  Why does he think they should get preferential treatment?  Why did they not have to go out on strike, given that Bus &Eacute;ireann workers have spent the last 13 days on the picket line without pay?  They have been receiving the brunt of the anger and ire of people who have been discommoded.  They have unfairly been described as being, at some level, the worst enemies of this country.  Indeed they are not.

The workers who have been suffering on the picket line for 12 days are determined that they will not be done down to the extent of 30% pay cuts and an assault on our public transport system.  The Minister did not respond to what I said about TII's revelation that it has an extra &euro;100 million it did not expect to have.  I reiterate that &euro;100 million is going a-begging.  What would be more appropriate than spending some of this additional &euro;100 million, which is not earmarked for anything, on the resolution of a national transport strike that is about protecting our bus transport infrastructure and ensuring towns and villages up and down this country have a public service transport infrastructure?

The Belgian Government pays 78% towards the PSO as it is known in Ireland.  The equivalent figure is 51% in Switzerland, 49% in Holland and 12% in Ireland, which is in last place.  The underfunding of a public service like Bus &Eacute;ireann was destined to end in a crisis.  This crisis is not confined to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We also need to look at what will happen in Dublin Bus over the next year when 10% of its routes are opened to private operators.  The exact same thing that is happening to Bus &Eacute;ireann workers will happen to Dublin Bus workers.  This is an ideological assault on public transport in Ireland.

It is monumentally short-sighted because at a time when our cities are becoming more and more clogged up with cars, we need more investment in public transport.  Such investment is the right thing to do economically, socially and environmentally.  It is difficult not to conclude that the short-sighted approach that is being pursued at present has not come about by accident or on account of laziness, but has been arrived at on foot of deliberate Government policy.  The Minister seems to be a fan of paper walls between himself and Bus &Eacute;ireann and between Expressway and the PSO routes.  I would like to compare the operation of the route between Cork and Waterford by a private operator with how it is operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The Bus &Eacute;ireann service stops in ten places, including small villages.  That is a public service and the Minister needs to recognise that.

Unfair advantages are being afforded to private operators that are in competition with Bus &Eacute;ireann, which is trying to meet its public service obligation.  It is quite evident from the figures and statistics that Bus &Eacute;ireann is not competing on a level playing pitch.  Private operators must be obliged to have some public service obligations too.  The Government cannot consistently allow routes to be cherry-picked by the private operators, while at the same time wondering why Bus &Eacute;ireann is having difficulties with its financial viability.  We are not asking the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to get involved in the industrial relations side of this matter.

He mentioned that the examination of the free travel scheme \"is almost complete and the issue will be resolved satisfactorily\".  As we know, Bus &Eacute;ireann receives far less compensation than private operators in respect of passengers who use the free travel scheme.  That is part of the solution.  The management of Bus &Eacute;ireann is staring down the barrel of examinership as it tries to close a deficit.  The Minister is saying that part of the solution is almost complete.  He needs to deal with that part of the solution to this problem.  We have been told that efficiencies were used to find &euro;50 million for the garda&iacute; and a further &euro;120 million to bring forward the &euro;1,000 increase under the Lansdowne Road agreement.
