Are the minutes of the meeting of 6 December 2012 agreed?  Agreed.  On matters arising from the minutes, we will deal with the draft report on the HSE under item 6.  The other issues referred to in the minutes relate to Dublin WaterWorld.  There are two issues to be dealt with.  First, the official response to our report on the VAT charge and second, new evidence that has been submitted to the committee from Dublin WaterWorld which contains extracts of legal advice to Campus Stadium Ireland from PwC where the whole issue of the weakness of the case was set out in 2002.  I propose that we accept generally the note from the Department on its reaction to our report, which, essentially, outlines its intention to implement the main points relative to our report.<\/p><p>  However, in the context of the second item, which is the correspondence received from Dublin WaterWorld, I would suggest that we hold that matter open.  What is being suggested here is that CSID was made fully aware by PwC in late 2002 that its case to levy VAT on Dublin WaterWorld was not in compliance with the VAT regulations - in e-mails, they talk about their approach being \"not perfect\".  It appears, based on this, that the case rested on the fact that Revenue had not updated its own guidelines.  Therefore, and without going into detail on what is a technical issue, we need to know why CSID, a State company, went all the way to the Supreme Court when at the minimum its legal advisers were telling it in 2002 that its case did not fit the law of the land.  The committee was given assurances that the legal advice was fully in support of the strategy pursued.  At a minimum, the extracts of legal advice, as contained in emails from PwC to its client, casts some doubt on that.<\/p><p>  I propose to ask the Accounting Officer, who only took possession of this issue when there was a change in departmental responsibility for sport, to review his files and to ascertain first, whether the files he reviewed when giving evidence to the committee contained the PwC advice that has now been made available to the committee and second, if he remains satisfied, based on this further review, that his evidence to the committee, in terms of the legal strategy followed, still stacks up.<\/p><p>  As we stated in our report, this case went all the way to the Supreme Court and now the State is facing what is, most likely, a hefty legal bill, and the evidence now submitted to the committee appears to lend more support to the contention that this issue should have been resolved in 2002 and that the VAT issue should never have been pursued.<\/p><p>  We will await a response from the Accounting Officer.  We have asked for a comprehensive and speedy response.  On receipt of that, we will place the matter on the agenda for an early meeting of the committee in 2013.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  On correspondence received since meeting of Thursday, 6 December 2012, the following is correspondence from accounting officers and-or Ministers.

In addition, it is the procurement authority for PPP projects, other than those in the transport and local authority sectors.  Major PPP contracts entered into during the past decade or so had, up to the end of 2011, cost the Exchequer approximately &euro;2.3 billion and involved legally binding commitments to pay a further &euro;4 billion.  Programmes of future projects are in place in a number of sectors and these are expected to result in further substantial Exchequer commitments.  As a result, it is important that there be a sound understanding of the circumstances in which PPPs can deliver good value and where it is better to avoid that method of procurement.<\/p><p>  There is relatively little detailed information in the public domain on Irish PPPs.  Financial commitment information is presented, in varying levels of detail, in the financial statements of public bodies.

The first objective of the NDFA is to ensure the State gets value for money on all public capital investment projects referred to it for financial advice.  Since 2007 the NDFA has been responsible also for managing the procurement of public private partnership projects, PPPs, outside of the transport and local authority sectors.  In performing its duties the NDFA is required to have due regard to the guidance and directions issued by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the financing and procurement of public investment projects.<\/p><p>  The NDFA has two quite clear and specific statutory mandates.  The first is the provision of financial advice to State authorities.  Once a project is referred for advice, the NDFA is responsible for maintaining the financial integrity of a procurement process for the specific contract and ensuring value for money is achieved in that process.  The mandate does not include advising on policy or economic matters relating to projects or other project budget issues that remain the responsibility of the sponsor and sanctioning authority.  Consequently the NDFA has no role in project identification or selection or the basis on which a project may proceed.  The second mandate is the procurement of all PPPs outside of the local authority and the transport sectors.  The NDFA acts as a procuring and delivery agent for the relevant State authority within the budgetary and project scope as defined by the sponsoring and sanctioning authorities.<\/p><p>  In the past year the education sector has been the most active for the NDFA.  The second bundle of PPP schools, having reached financial close in June 2010, was delivered ahead of the programme time, with the final school completed in October 2011.  These six schools provide accommodation for 4,700 students in Cork, Limerick, Kildare, Wicklow and Meath.  The preferred tenderer for the third bundle of schools, BAM public private partnership, was appointed in September 2011.  Planning permission was secured for all schools by May 2012.  On 9 November 2012, the NDFA awarded the contract for schools bundle 3 to BAM public private partnership PGGM Infrastructure Cooperatie, a joint venture between BAM public private partnership and Dutch pension fund administrator PGGM.  Construction has now commenced.  When completed, the eight schools in bundle 3 will provide accommodation for approximately 5,700 students in Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Limerick, Waterford, Westmeath and Wexford.  In the meantime the project will have created 1,100 jobs, of which 200 are already on-site.<\/p><p>  The NDFA continues to work with the National Roads Authority in its role as financial adviser on PPPs.  Good progress is currently being made in moving the N11-Newlands Cross public private partnership to financial close.  The preferred tenderer for the N11-Newlands Cross PPP is also BAM public private partnership PGGM Infrastructure Cooperatie.<\/p><p>  In March 2012, the Minister for Education and Skills announced details of 219 new major school building projects as part of a &euro;2 billion capital investment programme.  The NDFA, together with the Office of Public Works, the vocational education committees and county councils, will assist the Department with the delivery of more than 80 major school projects.  The NDFA has commenced work with the Department on the delivery of 18 of these 80 school building projects.<\/p><p>  The NDFA continues to provide financial advice on all projects referred to it and is currently advising State authorities on 25 active projects.  Developments in the past year included the opening in July 2012 of the new cystic fibrosis unit in St. Vincent's University Hospital, for which the NDFA provided financial advice to the Health Service Executive.  In August the NDFA was involved in the successful drawdown of a direct loan of &euro;100 million to the Exchequer to finance a programme of school building improvement projects that are to be procured on a traditional - that is, non-PPP - basis for the Department of Education and Skills.  In late November a further &euro;100 million traditional loan contract was signed between the European Investment Bank and the NTMA in respect of traditional water-wastewater projects.<\/p><p>  Recognising the continuing infrastructure deficit in certain sectors and the need for job creation, the Government announced a stimulus package on 17 July 2012 to provide investment amounting to approximately &euro;2.25 billion on a range of important new projects designed to stimulate economic growth and create employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012121300005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355394600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>May we publish the statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012121300006#E00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355394600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012121300006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1355394600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their attendance.

Mr. Murphy is far more knowledgeable than me about the UK system which has been in operation for some time.  Changes have been made recently to the structure.  At last week's meeting I referred to a report compiled by the UK National Audit Office in April 2011.  The report made observations and arrived at conclusions on the PPP system.  While it found that private finance delivered benefits for the delivery of infrastructural projects, it questioned whether more could be done to capture the share of the benefits for the taxpayer to level the playing field between the private company and the taxpayer.  Is Mr. Murphy familiar with this report?

My colleagues and I maintain extensive dialogue with our opposite numbers in the United Kingdom, both in the Treasury and the various procurement authorities, including Scottish Futures.  The book on public private partnerships was written in the United Kingdom.  The rest of the world has been learning from the United Kingdom.  It is fair to observe that it has, to date, delivered 717 infrastructural projects which might not otherwise have been delivered and which have cost tens of billions of euro.  We have studied closely the findings of the National Audit Office's report, the Chancellor's statement last week and also the introduction of the PF2 model which attempts to implement some of these conclusions and the lessons to be learned.  The perception is that some of the value achieved has been retained in the private sector and that the taxpayer needs to see more of it.  I refer to the example of Scotland where a new PFI-PPP model has been introduced which attempts to cap equity returns to the private sector.  The jury is out in this regard and it remains to be seen whether it will work.  The Scots have an ambitious PPP programme which is somewhat similar to ours and they aim to apply this model of capped returns.  The ultimate barometer of success will be whether there is a competitive and active market for these projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012121300006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1355394600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I refer to the PF2 model.

There is a real concern that if the taxpayer were to have a significant equity interest and seats on the board, this could create conflicts of interest.  I can foresee situations where serious conflicts of interest could arise.  More important, perhaps, there has been comment by professional investors in the industry that it would make it much more difficult for them to invest if they were put in a position where they would have to carry the bid risk and costs and then just before financial closure, they would have to offload a lot of their equity.

The best way of protecting the taxpayer and to ensure value for money is to ensure there is a rigorously competitive bidding process.  That provides the greatest protection for the taxpayer.

Now that the PPP operators are the only monitors of the throughput of the water and wastewater plants, they have been able to raise certain issues which were not known or sufficiently accounted for at the design stage.

I have not mentioned unpaid sub-contractors and annual contracts, but I will get to those in a minute.<\/p><p>  To knock on the head what Mr. Murphy has said, I put a parliamentary question to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, asking whether he was assured all Exchequer funded construction projects, which includes those of the NDFA, are completed in accordance with registered employment agreements.  This question was answered on Thursday, 22 November.  The Minister responded that the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, had conducted inspections on this and provided its figures for 2010, 2011 and 2012 to end-August.  NERA inspected 183 sites and found that there was non-compliance of 51%.  NERA conducted 30 inspections this year, to end-September, on electrical registered employment agreements and found there was non-compliance of 37%.  The overall level of non-compliance was 49%.  Therefore, I give diddly squat credence that the due diligence done in advance of what is happening on the ground, on the basis that the NERA inspections show 51% non-compliance with registered employment agreements, including sites for which the NDFA signed contracts.<\/p><p>  The response did not deal with the issue of whether people on the sites were claiming social welfare.  That is a different issue, but the NDFA should be concerned about it.  What mechanism does the NDFA have in place to check there is compliance in this regard?  The NDFA will say it gets a certificate of compliance from an architect when he or she signs off for payment, but that means nothing in practice.  Compliance with health and safety rules should also be verified.  I put forward the official NERA figures to debunk the theory there is compliance.

We cannot get to county managers or those who are driving the Poolbeg project, nor can we readily obtain information relating to local authorities, PPP projects and the former's input into the latter.

If people are going to take on such work, then in certain instances they should be paid for it.  However, the idea that the head of one State agency would sit on the board of another and get paid for doing so is outrageous.  I wish to clarify a number of matters for the record.

If there are enabling works in any particular projects, such as land purchase or any such items, they are not part of that particular test, that is a matter for the State of look after itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012121300016#P04000","nonspeaker":"Mr.  Gerard Cahillane"},{"type":"speech","time":1355400600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>How is that taken into account when we are looking at this in terms of being a participants<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012121300016#P04100","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355400600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>In terms of the particular value for money test for which we are responsible, it is not taken into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012121300016#P04200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Cahillane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355401200,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Who does that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012121300017#Q00200","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355401200,"counter":377,"content":"<p>That would have been done by Dublin City Council, DCC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012121300017#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Cahillane"},{"type":"speech","time":1355401200,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Does anyone check that analysis for the council?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012121300017#Q00400","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355401200,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I am not aware of how that is processed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012121300017#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Cahillane"},{"type":"speech","time":1355401200,"counter":380,"content":"<p>We need to find out.

I wish to elaborate on a number of points which may have been touched on.  I refer to the report of a review carried out by the UK national audit office.  I refer to the breakdown of the share of profit between public sector and private sector in public private partnerships.  Is it possible for either to make a profit from a PPP?  Are the terms of a PPP made public?  Does the NDFA carry out a cost-benefit analysis?  It would seem that in the case of the UK, the government would have built the projects at a cheaper cost if it had borrowed the money rather than using the PPP system.  I wish to tease out the issue of value for money.  The UK equivalent system is called a private finance initiative.  The UK national audit office report highlighted that these were poor value for money compared with a system where the government borrowed the full total and the project was then a public project.  In some cases these projects were being used to circumvent departmental budgets.  Do the contracts incentivise the contractors in any way?  Does the NDFA include a renegotiation clause in the contract?  I ask Mr. Murphy to shed some light on how PPPs work.  Irish contractors find it difficult to get bonds.  How many PPPs involve major Irish contractors?  Are their tendering prices robust?  Are they tendering at such low rates that these are not sustainable?  Does the NDFA carry our due diligence inspections on the contracting companies?  Is there scope for breaking down a PPP into a number of units so that smaller Irish building companies can tender for the work?

This is an international market, not an Irish market or a UK market or even a European market.  It is a global market.  The capital is very fungible, very mobile and will migrate to where the perceived returns are best.  For instance, Scotland has introduced a new model of PPP where the returns for equity holders are capped.  This sounds great and is marvellous protection for the taxpayer, but if investors do not take the bait, then projects will not be built.  It is a difficult and very challenging balancing act.  Our role is to ensure the best value for money for the taxpayer.  This would imply minimising the equity return to the private sector.  On the other hand, it is essential to attract sufficient interest from the private sector to create the value for money, to get the competitive tension going.

Our equity investors, who are the sponsors and leads, like to see very large projects but, with the diminished capacity we have in our market, contractors here would like to see much smaller projects.  Again, we have to find a balancing act to structure deals such that we are attractive to both parties.  It means we tend to make our projects slightly larger.  One of the reasons for that is the transaction costs that go with PPPs.  Generally, a contract value of around &euro;50 million would be the bottom threshold.  That obviously creates barriers to the participation of SMEs.  To take 2007 as an example, that was less of an issue and there was plenty of work for everybody but that is not the case today.  We have embarked on an initiative with Enterprise Ireland to look at ways in which we might offer greater transparency to the opportunities for SMEs within the PPP programme.  We are trialling that approach through the devolved schools building programme, which is the traditional one.  We, along with Enterprise Ireland, will host a market launch day for that programme next Monday and we will advise those who would participate in this that they would be required to participate, for example, in meet the buyer type events.

For a number of years, my predecessor and I have reported on PPPs.  As Mr. Murphy stated, from as early as 2003 we have been making the point that there is a need for more information in the public domain on what delivers value for money in respect of PPPs.  This also applies to capital projects in general and what makes them work.  Sponsoring Departments have an obligation to account publicly for their performances and the achievement of value for money. The Fact That my office can consider the details of an individual project is not a substitute for accountability.  The importance of putting good information into the public domain still stands.<\/p><p>  Deputy Murphy asked how we account for updated information.  I made the point last week that there is a distinction between what the NDFA does in examining a project and what is referred to as value-for-money testing in that context.  It is about trying to decide what is the better way to procure a project rather than considering value for money, which has another meaning in the sense of determining whether we need to be engaging in one project rather than another.  In this regard, I refer to cost-benefit analysis.  As Mr. Cahillane said, there are various technicalities that arise in regard to the assessments in both contexts, but the departmental guidelines on capital projects emphasise that where significant developments happen in the course of developing a project, there is a need to revisit the earlier decision &ndash; the cost&ndash;benefit decision &ndash; in the light of the later information.<\/p><p>  The National Audit Office has made a point on the visibility of returns, to which Mr. Murphy referred in the context of financial models.  Certainly, one can see the level of return expected for a project if it runs according to a model&rsquo;s projection.  However, the outturn is not known.  I do not believe there are structures in place to do so.  PF2 in the United Kingdom is making suggestions about trying to have more visibility on the actual returns achieved by private sector partners rather than projected returns suggested by the model.<\/p><p>  With regard to the projected returns, Mr. Murphy mentioned a return of 13% to 15%, which may reasonably be expected in a risk-bearing commercial venture.  That would be a central expectation but the outturn could be higher or lower.  Typically in these projects, there are limiting constraints built in so that any excess benefit would be shared between the public and private sector partners.  Alternatively, if a project does not turn out to be as lucrative as projected, there is a floor below which the private sector partner will not incur a loss.  This is the case with roads projects.  It is a very technical and difficult area.  If the Committee of Public Accounts is to be given a presentation by the NDFA, I would certainly like to attend and hear a little more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012121300019#S00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355402400,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Mr. McCarthy is very welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012121300019#S00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1355402400,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Chapter 6 of the 2011 report deals with a number of PPP projects for Departments and various bodies.

One of the unusual elements of the budget is that the House and, in particular, this committee must approve an increase in the HGRF because of the way it has been set up.  Essentially, the ceiling must be increased each year by the Oireachtas in order that the money can be drawn down.  That is why we are discussing this motion and not a series of other issues relating to budgetary decisions requiring Oireachtas approval.  With regard to how the fund has developed, members will be aware that a number of years ago, it reached its ceiling and we need to increase the fund and sanction that increase to continue to finance the horse racing and greyhound industries.  That is what I am asking the committee to do.<\/p><p>  I would like to put in context the decisions we have made on the HGRF in the budget.  This is not about simply subsidising a sector.  The State is making an investment in two industries, which give back many multiples of what we put in financially, never mind all the other benefits they generate for Ireland in terms of reputation, sporting prowess and excellence.  The horse and greyhound industries are worth approximately &euro;1.5 billion a year to the country.  They employ 28,500 people and even though many others will, politically, have a go at the horse racing industry, in particular, because wealthy and successful people are linked to the sport, the vast majority of people involved are not super wealthy.  They are ordinary people who provide services and products to the industry, work in stable yards, get up at 5 a.m. to train horses, and breed horses.  More than 85% of Irish thoroughbred horses are bred on farms with fewer than two mares.<\/p><p>  It is important to put in context why this industry is so important to Ireland and why, if we do not continue to support it financially as a State, it will be at risk of losing its competitive edge, in particular to Britain or France.  France is investing more than &euro;700 million of state money in horse racing.  We propose this year to put &euro;44 million into ours.  At the same time, Ireland continues to export 40% of all thoroughbreds exported from Europe each year and to breed the best.  The top six horses in the recent Melbourne Cup were Irish-bred.  Six of the top ten two-year olds in the world are Irish-bred.  We need to make a decision because the HGRF has been cut by 28% over the past five years.  We are spending less on the fund now than when it was introduced in 2001 with an allocation of almost &euro;59 million.  We are now spending &euro;55 million, having cut it again this year by another 2.5%.  In 2008, the fund received more than &euro;76 million and now we are at &euro;55 million which is split between horse racing and greyhound racing on an 80:20 basis.  The notion that we could knock another &euro;10 million off this amount, which one party sought in its pre-budget submission, and expect the industry to remain at No. 1 in the world in breeding and training is not realistic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012121300003#B00300","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355393700,"counter":452,"content":"<p>First, it is fair to say Fianna F&aacute;il has always supported this industry, even when other people were severely criticising it and saying we were only doing it for the great and the good.  The reality is, as the Minister rightly points out, there is huge employment in this industry and it is very important to us as a nation.  We have some natural advantages when it comes to this industry and there are not many industries where we could say we have as much natural advantage.  However, it is not so long ago that certain parties represented in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann were severely critical of the policy in place in regard to tax relief on stallion coverings, at a time when we had some 40% of world stallion coverings.  I remember how that tax relief was totally misrepresented and how people tried to say the whole horse industry was tax exempt when it was not.  This tax break was a very limited part, and a part that drew world attention and brought people to this country.  I am pleased the Minister is so supportive of what is a major employer in rural Ireland.  At the time, we again and again pointed out that if we were getting the kind of numbers out of multinationals per investment that we were getting out of this industry, people would be writing it up in lights and calling it a fantastic achievement.<\/p><p>  The question I have for the Minister is slightly different.  Unusually, we brought in legislation in 2001 which, although the Department of Finance does not like this, effectively introduced hypothecation, which meant the tax revenue that came in was directly streamed into the industry.  I believe that was a good idea.  It meant the more the industry succeeded, the more money it got, and one got into a virtuous circle.  It failed because the revenue from betting tax dropped due to the migration of people, not from betting to not betting, but from betting in betting shops to betting online.  All anyone need do is use their phone to realise why people would not bother going to a betting shop when they can do it all online on their phones.<\/p><p>  Has the Minister a commitment from the Minister for Finance that, when the new Bill is enacted next year, please God, there will be hypothecation in what will then be the betting (Amendment) Act 2013?  In other words, will all of the proceeds from the betting tax go back into the horse industry?  This would have two big advantages for the Minister.  First, it would stop him having to take money every year out of his budget that could be spent on cattle, sheep, pigs and all the other things we would like to spend money on.  Second, it would ensure the revenue stream for the horse industry in this country.<\/p><p>  When we get offline betting, will we get hypothecation and will the money go into the horse and greyhound industry or not?  Let us not forget the importance of the greyhound industry.  It might be the Cinderella of the two industries but it is very pervasive and important around the country.  In any case, if we are not going to get hypothecation, the Minister might as well scrap the whole idea of a levy where half of the levy goes into the fund and the other half goes to general taxation.  My view is that half-hypothecation is not sustainable in the long term and the Minister might as well throw all the tax into the Exchequer.  However, I believe that would be wrong.<\/p><p>  The idea of hypothecation was very simple, as I have tried to explain.  With most budget items, people can see straight away why we spend the money.  However, I think it fair to say that, in times of recession, many people do not see the horse industry as an industry and they have a resistance to spending money on what they consider a sport.  If it appears as a budget line, with no matching funds, there will be ever greater resistance and people will say \"Sure we can take &euro;20 or &euro;30 million off it.  It is only the horse guys.  They have these fantastic studs.  Look at the hedges round them.  In most places, you cannot get in the gates, they are so valuable\".  The idea of the hypothecated fund was that it clearly showed the connection between the money in and the money out.  The Minister could say quite simply that we are funding this out of the industry itself and what is coming in on one side, we are putting back into the industry because of the employment and so on.  Therefore, the link between the income and the expenditure would be reconnected in people's minds.<\/p><p>  My fear is that if the Department of Finance does what it has always wanted to do in this case, and the money is put into general taxation and gets lost in the maw of the &euro;30 billion plus of taxation, and then, on a separate sheet of paper, &euro;55 million appears for the horse and greyhound industry at a time when we are cutting carer's allowance and so on, it will be said this is a crazy thing to do, forgetting, of course, that if that industry did not exist, the betting industry would not exist here either.<\/p><p>  We will obviously approve the motion today.  However, I put down a clear marker that if the betting tax proposal does not go back to full hypothecation, that is, if the money collected from the betting tax does not go straight into the industry, we will not be supporting the Bill.  I have to make that absolutely clear.  This half-hypothecation is a cod - it is a nonsense at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012121300005#D00200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1355393700,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's comments and I would be extremely supportive.  He touches on the fact that almost 30,000 people are employed directly by the horse and greyhound industry in this country and it has an economic output of &euro;1.4 billion.  I know this well as more than 4,000 of those people are directly employed in Kildare, where I am from.  The impact on rural communities where there are few alternative streams of income is very evident.  The statistic of 85% of breeders having two mares in the farmyard stands out.  It is easy to have the imagery of the big studs but it is the small, indigenous provider that is keeping this industry going and has kept it a world leader for so long.<\/p><p>  It is worth noting that Ireland is the fourth largest producer of thoroughbreds in the world, producing 40% of EU output and 11% of the world's total.  Irish horses are exported to over 35 countries around the world, with a total value of over &euro;150 million last year.  The industry is a very important source of high value foreign direct investment and over two thirds of the production of thoroughbreds is exported every year.  Ireland has many natural advantages, such as climate, soil type and, most important, our people.  We have the expertise.  I have a habit of repeating the phrase that to get out of this recession, we do not need to reinvent the wheel, we just need to concentrate on the things we are good at and get back to basics.  The horse racing and breeding industry is one of the industries we need to support. <\/p><p>  There is a risk, however.

Like previous speakers, I support the motion.  I have been steeped in this industry since I was young.  I am proud of our reputation and excellence in the sport.  However, we need to be realistic.  The Minister mentioned the staggering amount of money which France is investing in its industry and we are all aware of the great performance of Great Britain in national hunt and flat racing.  Our racecourses are a disgrace, in particular our two top flat racecourses at the Curragh and Leopardstown.  In the Celtic tiger era there were plans to construct a world class racecourse at Abbotstown, which would have attracted in foreign trainers.<\/p><p>  I agree with the Minister that we are breeding good horses.  However, while people are buying them they no longer leave them here for training.  While I support this motion before us today a lot more needs to be done for the future and sustainability of this industry.  I agree with what was said by the previous two speakers.  We have a major artery - the betting industry - that is bleeding.  It is not yesterday or the day before that people began betting online, this commenced up to eight years ago.  Many of us have had Paddy Power online accounts for years.  I would welcome a speedy enactment of the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2012 in 2013.  <\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on the need to ensure we capture taxable income so as to allow the industry to support itself.  We should not underestimate the foreign direct investment which this industry has brought to Ireland.  Racing is believed to attract rich people.  That is true.  However, the trainers are not the rich people.  They are ordinary hardworking people.  What is wonderful about the industry is that it attracts people such as Neil Diamond, Burt Bacharach, Sheikh Mohammed or Sheikh Hamdan.  There is now interest in the industry here from Qatar and China.  Enterprise Ireland works hard to attract companies like Google and Yahoo here.  We have all the natural resources required, in  terms of our land, people and talent in this area, to achieve a great horse racing industry here.  Let us not underestimate the foreign direct investment that can ensue from the industry in the future.<\/p><p>  The reality is that people are no longer going racing.  Our racecourses are in a sorry state.  When in New Zealand and Australia during the past two years, I went racing.  Their racecourses are beautiful while ours are sad.  I was told that the sale of television rights in respect of those courses to the SIS virtual betting channel has helped them survive.  While everybody here is betting online we do not know where that money is going.  It is certainly not going to our Exchequer.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012121300006#E00200","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1355394300,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  Coming from the Carlow-Kilkenny area I know the benefit of the horse racing and greyhound industries.  The majority of horse breeding enterprises here are people with a couple of acres of land and a few mares.  Some people keep ponies for use by their children and farmers often breed them for point to points.  We all know how popular they are.  There are also other people who are involved in bigger set ups, such as, for example, Jim Bolger and the Mullins family in Kilkenny and Carlow, which are similar to small to medium businesses in terms of the number of people employed therein.  When a factory opens in a particular area and 30 or 40 people get employment there, people are aware of it.  However, much of what goes on in this industry is unseen.  As stated, much of what happens in this area happens at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. Jim Bolger could have up to 30 or 40 people riding out horses every morning, as could Willie Mullins.  The horse racing industry is huge in terms of the amount of employment it provides.<\/p><p>  It is important the greyhound industry is not forgotten.  There are people in every parish in Ireland who breed horses or greyhounds.   The greyhound industry here is also important, with many greyhounds bred here going to England to race in the Derby and so on.  As mentioned, it is important we ensure our excellence in this area is continued.  If not, somebody else will move in and push us aside.  The new money is in the Far East and China.  We are all aware that some studs are tying in with China on horse breeding programmes and so on.  It is important funding for the industry is ensured to allow us remain at the top of our game and tie into this new money.  China, which is a vast country with a huge population, is hugely interested in the greyhound and horse industry.  We must ensure our industry is properly funded to allow it take advantage of the demand from China for top quality horses and greyhounds.   <\/p><p>  While funding of &euro;45 million appears a large amount, funding in this area has been cut by 28% in the past few years.  Despite this, the industry has survived.  We must ensure this funding remains in place to allow the industry continue its excellence in horse breeding, be it by a farmer for point to point or at Coolmore for racing in the Melbourne Cup or Derby races and so on.

I suspect we are on the same page in regard to where we would like to go, first in terms of getting the system working and then in terms of looking at the future rate.  I have made no secret of the fact that I believe the betting tax should be increased, but that is not my decision.  I do not make decisions on taxation.  I will make my case and the Government will make a decision.  Let us have a system that can capture even that 1% of online and remote betting revenue, which would bring in a considerable amount of money.  I am told it may come to more than &euro;15 million because of the volume of this type of betting.  Let us get that up and running and working and have a licensing system for taking online bets from Irish punters.  It does not matter whether one is based in Zanzibar or Dublin; if one takes a bet online from an Irish punter, one must be licensed to do so and one must pay for that licence or else run the risk of being shut down.  Let us also be clear about what we are doing in the legislation.  The actual collection of the 1% of turnover is a separate matter.  In my view, most people who bet online will bet with reputable bookmakers and betting exchanges they know and trust, to which they can give their credit card details.  Primarily, one is talking about the big names - Betfair, Paddy Power, Ladbroke's or whoever.  I believe this will work and I am anxious that we should move on and finalise the legislation in order to get that new revenue stream.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012121300007#F00500","speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Messages to D\u00e1il and Seanad","time":1355394900,"counter":463,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012121300007#F00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1355394900,"counter":464,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 87, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<br \/> The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine has completed its consideration of the following motion:<blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the following Order in draft:<br \/>Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2012,<br \/>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 6th December, 2012.<\/blockquote><br \/>In accordance with Standing Order 72, the following message will be sent to the Seanad:<br \/>The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine has completed its consideration of the following motion:<br \/>That Seanad &Eacute;ireann approves the following Order in draft:<blockquote>Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2012,<br \/>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 6th December, 2012.<br \/>I thank the Minister and his officials for attending today and wish them a happy Christmas, as this is the last occasion we may be able to do so.  <br \/>I wish the Minister every success next week at the Council meeting.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012121300007#F00700","speaker":"968"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Business of Joint Committee","time":1355394900,"counter":465,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012121300007#F00850"},{"type":"speech","time":1355394900,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Before the Vice Chairman finishes, may I, too, wish all the members a happy Christmas.

However, for us, as a committee, there are some important and pertinent areas that I would like to see dealt with in the context of Ireland's Presidency.<\/p><p>  One of the foremost issues is climate change.  The committee can play an important role in climate change policy at European level and that opportunity rests on all of us in the committee, whether one is a Member of the Lower or Upper House.  I would like to see the Minister take a lead role, for example, in reducing carbon emissions and mitigating the global warming issue.  We can take the lead on that.  We are ideally placed as an island nation, with a rich maritime history.  There is significant potential in terms of renewable energy such as wind energy and on issues with which the Minister is well acquainted.<\/p><p>  The Seventh Environment Action Programme is the next big European issue.  It will set our environmental agenda until 2020.  Among other matters, it will provide guidelines for the management of the Europe Union's natural resources and it will influence the resources we use and how we will use them.<\/p><p>  A significant issue is the debate about the use of shale gas and I would like to see us establish a position in that regard.  Can we establish, for example, whether there are cleaner, more easily accessible alternative resources, and if not, why?  How important is that in terms of developing the alternative?  What stance should we as a country take on that issue?<\/p><p>  Another issue is housing, not only in terms of how it might impact on us individually in our different areas but in terms of a European-wide approach to issues such as retrofitting.  It is significant work.  There is a significant function in that regard for the committee in its work in 2013.<\/p><p>  The redevelopment of town centres is a critical issue.  It is critical to the economic recovery of many town centres and it is good in terms of reigniting the hearts of communities.  I would like to see that being pursued in our agenda in the context of the Presidency.<\/p><p>  These are important issues, but there are others.  Members will have views in that regard.  I would remind members of the two issues we are discussing.  I would urge them not to stray from them and to keep their contributions germane to those two topics.

We face many challenges in realising those ambitions, but we believe our aims are achievable.  At the end of June 2013, I hope to be able to come back to the committee and account for this high level of ambition with a number of achievements under our belts.<\/p><p>  In preparing for the Presidency, we have had extensive engagement on our emerging agenda with my colleague Ministers on the Council and their Departments, and we have had much discussion with the European Parliament and the Commission.  I have met the Chair of the Parliament's environment committee on a number of occasions and I have also been engaging actively with the relevant MEP rapporteurs for the files we have been prioritising in the past 15 months or so.  Needless to say, I have also been liaising closely with the Commissioner for the Environment, Mr. Janez Poto\u010dnik, who met the committee a few weeks ago, and with the Commissioner for Climate Action, Ms Connie Hedegaard, on the pipeline of policy and legislative proposals emerging from the Commission.

The threat will not be faced down the line, rather it is being faced now.  One does not need to go to these countries to see the effects when for much of the summer one could see water lying in fields of corn on the dry plains of County Kildare.  The fact that cornfields in the driest part of the country were under water tells us we have a problem with climate change.<\/p><p>  On the issue of indirect land use change, will the Minister outline what he has in mind and what the Council is dealing with?  I do not want to stray from the agenda, but this has been a huge issue all year and will be centre stage, not least because of the wet weather conditions.  There is a school of thought that was subscribed to by the last Government and the European Union that we should spread slurry based on use of the calendar because that is the best way to protect groundwater and rivers.  I questioned this view with the previous Minister who wrote back to tell me that it was based on European weather patterns.  I wrote back to him to state Ireland did not experience central European weather patterns.  We are living on the edge of the Atlantic and experience daily rain showers and storms.  I ask the Minister to use the period of the Presidency to address this matter because it will become a crunch issue in terms of Food Harvest 2020.  There will be more intensive livestock farming and higher densities and as such we must deal with this issue.  I want to protect the agriculture sector, but we must also protect groundwater.  We are in a different position because we have very different weather patterns than in countries in continental Europe, including Germany, France and Belgium.  We can show them what weather conditions are like and that they are very different and unpredictable.  We, therefore, need to have a different way of proceeding because it is ludicrous that farmers cannot spread slurry at certain times and when they do spread it at the times they are supposed to, it is followed by two or three wet days and the slurry is washed into rivers.  As this defeats the purpose completely, I ask that we use the period of the Presidency to address thae issue which the Minister knows will be a major one in the next five to ten years in this State, particularly in the context of Food Harvest 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012121300006#H00600","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1355412000,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I am pleased to tell the Deputy that the year is not yet over and that there will be a Government meeting next Tuesday at which one of the issues debated will be the heads of the climate change Bill.  I am sure the Deputy has noticed that I have stuck rigidly to what I set out in the road map last January and delivered on everything I said I would do.  I do not expect things to be any different next week.  I am also taking a policy document to the Government on the national climate change adaptation strategy.  That will also feature on the Government's agenda and we will see how that discussion proceeds.  It is another aspect of the climate change agenda and I am sure people will be anxious to see what proposals emerge in terms of adopting a whole of government approach towards a framework for adaptation to climate change to help deal with the problems faced.  <\/p><p>  The concept of indirect land use change, ILUC, is aimed at starting the transition to biofuel use to deliver substantial greenhouse gas emission reductions.  A reporting mechanism for emissions in respect of indirect land use is built into it.  It is a technical proposal.  Essentially, we are trying to move towards a second generation or advanced low ILUC biofuels strategy to allow these fuels to contribute more towards the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  This can be done in various ways such as through new installations, but we hope that whatever agreement is made, it can be brought into effect by 1 July 2014.  We might not get it all over the line by the end of our Presidency, but we expect to have a progress report on this file that I hope will meet the general thrust of the ILUC proposal.<\/p><p>  I am glad that the Deputy has very good and strong views on groundwater, but this was not always evident when we were talking about the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012121300006#H00700","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1355412000,"counter":493,"content":"<p>The Minister should not try to rewrite history.

We have seen major changes, including monsoon-like rainfall.  I have gone out of my way to help people to cope with the very heavy rainfall this year, subject to proper environmental standards being met, by providing for an extension of time for the spreading of slurry and making sure safeguards are put in place to maintain good environmental practice in so far as it is possible to do so.

On Doha, the expectation before the conference was that it would be more of a holding operation with little progress arising from the discussions in Durban.  Durban set out a strategy for the following three years.  The danger was that Doha would not advance matters, but we have succeeded arising from that conference in putting a work programme in place across the streams agreed there.  We have set a target of 2015 for a globally binding legal agreement.  There is an indication that there will be a Heads of Government meeting in 2014 to give the talks the required impetus.  These developments have been important to maintain the momentum towards a global agreement.<\/p><p>  Interestingly, we had some six EU co-ordination meetings during the course of the week and were able to establish a unified position on some very difficult issues, particularly on AEUs and surplus carbon tax credits.  Poland and certain other former eastern bloc member states had a great difficulty on surrendering or cancelling to balance the market and reduce emissions.  Many member states which are progressive on climate change policy wanted to see the cancellation of AEUs post-2020, but for five years it was not possible to get agreement from Poland.  Agreement was achieved in the EU meetings which were held in Doha.  There is now a unified EU position which gives us a great deal more credibility on climate change policy.  The EU contributes only 11% of emissions.  There are countries which classify themselves as \"developing\", including China and Brazil, which are major contributors to emissions and which are not making the contribution we would expect at this stage.  The European Union, with Australia, Norway and Switzerland, are the leaders who are advancing a programme on climate change and the reduction of emissions.  We are trying, albeit it is happening far too slowly, to get the USA, Russia, China and other large states on board to make the emissions reductions required to make a significant impact on quality of life and the development agenda and to mitigate the problems associated with climate change.  We are seeking also to bring forward adaptation policies and that will cost money.<\/p><p>  We agreed also at Doha on a fund.  The fast-start finance scheme agreed in Copenhagen set out &euro;7.2 billion which would be provided by the European Union to meet the needs of the least-developed and poorest countries and to assist them to adapt to climate change.  A board of directors is to be established to distribute the money.  We have met our commitments solemnly and have credibility with the small island states and least developed countries.  We have achieved in 2012 what we said we would in Copenhagen in 2009, notwithstanding the financial difficulties many European countries have been experiencing.<\/p><p>  I assure the joint committee that we will continue to be energetic in pursuing the domestic agenda on waste, water and local government reform.  We have a very ambitious agenda of reform in the Department and we have the resources and staff to meet our commitments, in particular on local government in advance of the local elections in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012121300007#J00200","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1355412600,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for attending to meet us.  I wish them every success in the Presidency.  I thank them for the information they are giving us.  I have no doubt the Minister will prove he has had nothing to worry about when he is in the hot seat.  I have no doubt he will prove to be very effective.  I want to emphasise the importance of the flow of information back to the joint committee.  As I understand the Minister and his officials will be very busy, I would like to know what plans are in place to inform the joint committee and to make us aware of the issues arising during the campaign.<\/p><p>  I wish also to support Deputy Brian Stanley on agricultural issues, which are very important.  Inevitably, we will reach a point where we must confront how we will balance the effects of climate change and the directives thereon and the need to feed the world's growing population.  I am thinking particularly of Food Harvest 2020 and beyond to 2050 and the need to avoid penalising the Irish agricultural community, 96% of the production of which is exported.  Irish farmers produce very high quality food which is recognised across the world.  We must be aware of the need to break even in that context.  There is a debate among scientists, some of whom say that global warming is determined by cycles and that over various periods of time, it changes.  While I acknowledge the need to take action to preserve the climate, one must consider the Amazon where large tracts of forestry are being removed and corporate conglomerates such as Shell and BP are engaged in destructive practices which further their finances.  That is having an effect on climate.  We must also compare what the heavily industrialised nations are doing with the directives being enforced in Ireland.  There is little we can do, but we suffer significantly by way of efforts to improve climate conditions.  We must bear that in mind as an island nation.<\/p><p>  The Minister mentioned the &euro;7.2 billion fund for small-island nations.  How much will we benefit from that?

SSE is converting the plant from oil to clean gas and will almost double its capacity to 460 MW by 2016.  This work will have a significant impact on the decarbonisation of electricity generation.

I had expected to be able to assure the committee that the programme would be progressed during our Presidency, but I cannot do so, as the budget has not been agreed.  I hope it will be agreed to in February.  This important programme is a sizable issue for many member states, although there are not many LIFE projects in Ireland currently.  Perhaps the next programme will offer us better prospects.  There is a successful project in the Burren in County Clare.  There is a great deal of potential for the programme in the Deputy's constituency, particularly where boglands are no longer in operation for turf cutting on a commercial basis.  The biodiversity agenda could be exploited in the midlands more than has been the case to date.<\/p><p>  Deputy Michelle Mulherin asked many questions on various matters.  As part of our climate change emissions agenda, we are trying to move transport, particularly haulage companies, to using gas, but it will take time.  As part of our sectoral plans with Departments, including the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, we expect them to propose on a regular basis initiatives on incentivising the use of gas and low emission fuels in the eyes of our heavy haulage network.  We are using financial instruments in this regard.  Through motor taxation, for example, we err on the side of helping people to buy cars that are more carbon and technologically efficient.  We are also promoting the use of electric cars, in that zero tax will be applied to them.<\/p><p>  In the context of the heads of the climate change Bill which I hope will be approved by the Government next week, part of our carbon strategy will put the onus on the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Transport, Tourism and Sport, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and so on to table proposals on promoting the use of technology and financial instruments, including those outlined by Deputy Michelle Mulherin, to reduce emissions and meet our national targets.<\/p><p>  Fracking is a matter for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I would not like to trespass into that area at this time, as the Deputy can understand.<\/p><p>  To respond to Deputy Paudie Coffey's questions, I am aware of the project that will bring gas through Bord G&aacute;is to Great Island in County Wexford.  An excellent initiative, areas in the south east will now have access to clean fuel, giving them a major competitive advantage.  I understand the distance from the pipe network at Great Island to Waterford Port at Belview is only 2 km.  It presents an opportunity for Bord G&aacute;is to engage with stakeholders such as Glanbia in a more proactive way than might have been the case to date to ensure clean fuel is available in the context of national policy on reducing emissions and providing the gas and other infrastructure required to expand a facility that, unfortunately, has been lying dormant for too long.  We will make representations to Bord G&aacute;is to determine what can be done to prioritise the project in extending the gas network into Waterford Port.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012121300010#M01000","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1355414400,"counter":573,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his attendance.

The fact that they are still on board following the Doha conference and that there is a work programme setting out how the targets set will be achieved over the next two or three years is significant.  There were a number of conferences in Bonn in May, at which the process of how the particular milestones, on which the European Union is leading, were to be achieved.<\/p><p>  There will probably be a Heads of State and Governments meeting in September 2014, as proposed at the Doha conference by Secretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon.

We are conscious of the need to get all countries on board.  It is hoped the programme of work put in place at Doha will accelerate and concentrate the minds of people in the countries mentioned.  Members will be aware of the huge shift in the public mood in the United States following hurricane Sandy, particularly on the east coast.

I am delighted to welcome Professor Paul McMaster, chairman of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res UK, and Ms Jane-Ann McKenna, head of the Dublin office of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res.  Professor McMaster has had a long and distinguished career in medical surgery.  He joined M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res in 2004.  He has undertaken emergency surgical work in disaster and conflict settings across the world.  He recently returned from Syria and is here today to talk about his experience in delivering emergency medical assistance there, where conditions must be horrific.  Ms McKenna is well known to all of us and she addressed the committee in September last in respect of the situation in the region of South Kordofan and the Blue Nile.  Ms McKenna also briefed us on the work in which M&eacute;decins Sans Frontier&egrave;s is involved in Syria.<\/p><p>  The committee has taken a particular interest in Syria and members remain determined to do what they can to ensure that the dreadful events there remain in the public eye.  We have prioritised matters relating to Syria at our regular sessions with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in respect of EU Foreign Affairs Council meetings.  We have placed particular emphasis on the need to continue contributing to humanitarian relief efforts.  It is disturbing to note that the recent intensification in the conflict in Syria, which has already cost an estimated 40,000 people their lives.  The risk of the conflict spilling over Syria's borders and leading to neighbouring states being drawn into it remains very high.  This makes it all the more essential that political progress be made, especially in consolidating the unity of the opposition groups in Syria.  However, the prospects remain somewhat bleak at this stage and it is difficult to be optimistic.  Above all else, this conflict is a terrible human tragedy for the world and for the region in general.  In the absence of political progress being made, the humanitarian response becomes even more important.  We wish to focus our deliberations today on the humanitarian situation in Syria, where Professor McMaster recently spent five weeks attending to the wounded.  He has, therefore, visited the front line in a number of areas in Syria.<\/p><p>  Before I ask Professor McMaster and Ms McKenna to make their presentations, I wish to advise them that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of any utterances they make before this committee.

Civilians in the north west of Syria where three of the surgical field teams are working are living in basements, usually in buildings that have been bombed.  There has been no electricity in the area for eight or nine months and winter is coming fast.  Before I left a few weeks ago, it was extremely cold at night and I can only imagine that conditions will become very difficult.  The only cooking facility in a basement is an open camp fire in the middle of the floor.  They burn wood and rooms fill up with smoke.  As a consequence, the children are wheezing and access to medication is limited.  M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res is trying very hard to get medication to the few medics who are still there.<\/p><p>  I come from the field as an angry doctor, which is not really what members want to hear.  My anxiety is caused by reports from colleagues who have been able to get into the east of the country, to which I did not go, which suggest the needs there are every bit as great as what I experienced.  The field teams feel humbled by the inadequacy of what we have been able to do in the country and we are fearful of what the winter will mean for the people and what the future will bring.  We are immensely grateful, however, for the interest and support given to M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res Ireland in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012121300004#D00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Paul McMaster"},{"type":"speech","time":1355409300,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McMaster.

However, we see young fighters with gunshot wounds.  The injuries of civilians are largely inflicted in bomb and rocket attacks.  The system in the area I was in is that helicopters drop what are called barrel bombs loaded with explosives and fine shrapnel.  They explode over a wide area and women and children are being caught in the midst of them.  We have been presented with babies with shrapnel wounds which are not medically life threatening but deeply distressing and disturbing for the family.  The team I was supporting was working in a cave, which became untenable because of the bombing.  We then moved to a chicken farm - that is progress - which we were converting rapidly to an emergency field hospital.  There we started to see many more members of the general population who had run out of medication to treat blood pressure, diabetes and asthma and were struggling to gain access to basic health care.  I performed Caesarian sections and other emergency obstetrics procedures.  I took out a tooth for a person with an abscess as there was no dental service available to the community.  Although many had fled, I was truthfully surprised by how many were still there.  It tends to be the old who cannot or will not leaves their homes, the women and the children who stay.  We were seeing fighters and predominantly treating their gunshot wounds.  Although it was very rudimentary, we were using an inflatable operating theatre inside the cave.  Some of the other teams have more sophisticated facilities.  We were able to perform basic war surgery and treated many hundreds of patients.  In general, we cannot evacuate our patients; we must care for them where they are, although I hear some are able to cross the border. It is a challenging environment, medically and surgically.  For me, as a grandparent, I find it most difficult to see the wounded children and babies.  M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res is not a political but a medical organisation.  We want to access any area in which people are struggling.

They know we are there but they still have not given us permission to be there.  From our perspective it is an extremely insecure position in which to work.  Only yesterday, we publicised a region in eastern Syria which is further removed from the focus which is mostly on the western front.  The eastern area is vast and it has no assistance whatsoever.  In a town of 300,000 people, only 50,000 remain there.  They are under constant attack.  It was even too dangerous for us to set up our operation there.

What we have learned in other conflicts over the years is that, as Deputy O'Sullivan says, the immediate physical impact is clear but the long-term distress to these youngsters is immeasurable.  We need to support the Syrians to help them to help their children.  It is very difficult for us to help because of culture and communication issues.

A medical organisation needs to be very careful in these situations.  I was in Somalia for six months where I saw the best efforts come to very little.  I have worked in the Democratic Republic of Congo and various other spots and it was extremely difficult.  It is very important that we look to people with wide experience who are involved in the wider dimension in Geneva and elsewhere.  What I say to the Deputy from a medical and humanitarian point of view is that we look to the international community to do all it can to facilitate access to medical care.  That is the plea I make.  There are ways of doing this and different models; in some areas one is more likely to be successful, but as humanitarians, we press the international community to do this.  Ireland will shortly hold the Presidency of the European Union and I know with its generous history of support of humanitarian action, that it will consider this option.<\/p><p>   On a personal level, I am almost more worried about the peace rather than the fighting in Syria.  I do not want to be misunderstood, but when one listens to the people there, they say they are going to win the war and when one asks what will happen then, there is silence.  I encourage members to use their wisdom and experience to look at the peace model.  We have been in Sudan for 13 or 14 years and my fear is that if we are not very careful, we could be in Syria for a long number of years unless folk can find a way to ensure peace means real peace for all Syrians.

The safety of our personnel on the ground is based on everyone seeing them as neutral, impartial and apoliltical.  That means that in countries in which M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res works where there is significant conflict we do not accept funding from any institution, whether it be the DFID, ECHO or the United Nations.  We use funds very generously given by individuals across the world.  I repeat that we are immensely grateful for the support Irish Aid has been able to give for vaccinations against TB, malaria and cholera and without that help we could not have done so much, but in our work in conflict areas such as in Somalia, Syria and Afghanistan, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res will not ask for or accept support from any institution.

Like them, I am filled with admiration for the work our guests do.  Professor McMaster seems to be of the view that being angry is inappropriate.  Anger is a highly appropriate emotion, but it depends on how one directs one's anger.  Professor McMaster does not come across as being angry, although I accept that there may be a touch of Swiftian <i>saeva indignatio<\/i> about him.  Both of our guests come across as being extraordinarily balanced, rational and level headed.<\/p><p>  The name M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res says it all.  Our guests referred to access.  If there is any way the committee can assist on a diplomatic level, I am sure it will do so.  We will make that one of our primary points in our communications with the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, who will take a leading role when Ireland holds the Presidency of the European Union in the new year.  We should place particular emphasis on the need for access.  <\/p><p>  I am struck by the fact that M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res uses inflatable operating theatres.  I was not aware of that fact.  Professor McMaster described working in a cave which was dusty and difficult to access but in which was to be found a perfectly functioning hospital.  I presume the use of inflatable operating theatres allows the organisation to respond quickly and in awkward situations.<\/p><p>  I wish to ask a number of questions, some of which have been posed, but I am not sure that they were answered.  M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res has adopted the admirable position of not being political; it maintains a disconnection - or disinfection - from political aspects in so far as that is possible, and is neutral, etc.  Does this permit it to make records of violations of international and human rights protocols and compile lists relating to the use of prohibited or illegal munitions such as white phosphorus, cluster bombs, flechettes and other examples of the machinery of war, or is the organisation of the view that doing so would involve straying into political territory?  From my point of view, information in this regard would be highly useful.  Some of my colleagues referred briefly to the possibility of chemical warfare occurring.  I understand a strong political warning has been issued by the European Union and the United States to the effect that there will be certain unspecified consequences if chemical weapons are used.  It has been stated Scud missiles are already being used.  I think some may have been fired at the city to which Ms McKenna referred and the population of which has been reduced from 300,000 to 50,000.  That must be appalling.  Given that the targeting systems for Scud missiles are so imprecise - at least they were in the past, but they may have improved enormously since we last came across them - I presume the intention behind their use is for them to have a psychological impact rather than anything else.<\/p><p>  I was very impressed to read the information supplied on a particular family.  There were two women and a small baby involved.  The women were hysterical and the child had shrapnel wounds which appeared to be superficial and certainly not life-threatening.  What caused the women to be so upset was the helicopters hovering overhead and dropping devices containing shrapnel.<\/p><p>  I wish to pose a couple of questions which are political in nature and intended to elicit answers in respect of how we can help.  I suggest we push the idea of access which appears to lie at the heart of the ethos of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res.  It also appears to be at the core of the practical difficulties the organisation is encountering in Syria.  Is it in a position to advise the committee or the world at large on the use of prohibited weapons, particularly chemical weapons, or is it obliged to avert its gaze from such matters?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012121300007#G00500","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355411100,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I have the highest respect for politicians who grapple with some of the biggest problems in very difficult circumstances.

I express my admiration for the tremendous work done by the organisation they represent.  We can only imagine what the people of Syria are experiencing.  This places our own problems and difficulties with budgetary issues in perspective, particularly when one thinks of children living in camps, wheezing, burning wood to warm themselves and without access to electricity, when a very severe winter is approaching.  A previous speaker inquired as to what the committee might do.  M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res has issued a statement to the effect that it has not yet received authorisation from the authorities in Syria to work there in an official capacity.  Has progress been made in this regard or is such authorisation likely to issue in the near future?<\/p><p>  Reference was made to funding and the fact that, in the main, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res only accepted funding from individuals.  How adequate is the funding it is able to raise in covering its requirements in the current crisis?  Would it have the necessary manpower on the ground to deliver additional services if extra funding was to become available?  Will our guests indicate what we might do to best assist their organisation?  Our Presidency of the European Union for the first six months of next year will I hope provide us with a platform to help the people of Syria and assist M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res in addressing some of the issues under discussion.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan indicated, what is really remarkable is the lack of media coverage of this matter.  Very few people in this country are aware of the horrific crisis and tremendous challenges with which the people in north-west Syria are trying to deal.  As Christmas approaches, everyone here is spending a great deal of money on unnecessary things.  We would all be well advised to consider where there is real poverty and where the real challenges are to be found in the world.  We should pay particular attention to the plight of the people for whom M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res is trying to provide some hope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012121300007#G01100","speaker":"1118","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355411700,"counter":627,"content":"<p>Doctors are never satisfied with what they have, as I am sure is the case in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012121300008#H00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Paul McMaster"},{"type":"speech","time":1355411700,"counter":628,"content":"<p>In Ireland we believe we have a good medical system, yet there are crises or circumstances where we are not happy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012121300008#H00300","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355411700,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I probably should not say this, but the inflatable facilities are fantastic.

I exaggerate slightly.  We can gain access very quickly and create adequate facilities to perform major war surgery.  It is not complex neurosurgery or major thoracic surgery, but it is life-saving and prevents the infective complications that so often arise.<\/p><p>  People ask me why on earth I, as a retired surgeon, do what I do.  They say I see the worst of some parts of the world.  However, I also see the very best.  That young people from Ireland volunteer, in a difficult time, to work in places that are uncomfortable, at best, and very dangerous gives great hope.  That individuals will, in difficult circumstances, give funding to us offers great hope for the world.  It is a great privilege to work with and help young teams.<\/p><p>  MSF can call on hundreds of volunteers if it must scale up rapidly.  There are always contingency plans in the background.  If we believed we were being restricted financially, we would consider urgently our priorities and ensure we released sufficient resources to allow emergency teams to be deployed.  We will not be inhibited by a lack of funds.  If this means we must make appeals to the general public, we will do so.<\/p><p>  During the years MSF has developed techniques that allow it to respond to emergencies such as the effects of a tsunami or an earthquake, as in Haiti, if necessary.  Part of the problem is public awareness.  At Christmas time people do not want to watch the horrors of Syria on television.  I do not want to do so with my grandchildren either.  Members and their committees can play a valuable role in drawing attention to the circumstances that obtain and I remain optimistic that we can respond.

I have been asked to do this and the committee has received presentations, in particular a recent presentation on sexual violence in conflict.  At that session, there was a considerable concentration on the tragedy in the Congo.  It is almost unnecessary for me to rehearse the situation.  We all know of the extraordinary contrast between the mineral and natural resource wealth of that region and the poor conditions in which people in the Congo live.  They are classified as the poorest citizens on Earth despite that vast wealth.<\/p><p>  In the past few weeks, there has been an illegal occupation of Goma, although forces have since withdrawn from it.  Some 2.2 million are displaced and approximately 5 million have died, almost as many as died during the Holocaust in Europe.  Just as today when no one from the media was present at our meeting, there is a regrettable lack of media interest in this situation.<\/p><p>  There is an increasing humanitarian crisis.  The central authorities are unable to look after their citizens in terms of medical welfare, protection from tape and so on.  They are also unable to invest in infrastructure, for example, roads and rail networks.  Electronic communications are at a minimal level.  There is a range of militias and mercenaries and neighbouring countries are greedily fastening onto the wealth.<\/p><p>  It is appropriate that we as a committee should call for an immediate end to the conflict, the disarmament of the militias and the prioritisation of and re-engagement with existing political agreements.  I do not want to go on <i>ad nauseam<\/i>, as people can read the resolution.  It is lengthy.  If I was to speak on every aspect, we would be here for a long time, but that would not advance the cause.  People would be rather put off by the monotonous sound of my voice.<\/p><p>  Increasingly, we are receiving requests from international agencies and groups outside of Ireland to try to make use of the six-month window of opportunity presented by our Presidency of Europe as well as of the fact that, with the committee's strong support, we have achieved a seat on the UN Human Rights Council.<\/p><p>  If possible, I ask the committee to pass the motion.

It is astounding that the M23 rebels could move into Goma, which was protected by the United Nations force, and then threaten to march on to Kisangani, although one would not march from Kisangani to Kinshasa; they probably took boats down the river.  They threatened Kinshasa, the capital, which is thousands of miles away.  Somebody is pulling strings in the region and I suspect the finger is being pointed at Rwanda.  These troops have now withdrawn from Goma, which means someone is applying pressure somewhere, and talks have restarted among Kinshasa, Uganda and Rwanda.

I am delighted they are present in a joint capacity.  Youth work is an area in which I am interested as a former youth worker and community development worker.  Our guests are speaking to the converted.  Given the community and civic work done by the committee's members, they undoubtedly have an interest in this issue.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to welcome from Youth Work Ireland Mr. Patrick Burke, CEO, Mr. John Gilmore, president, and Mr. Michael McLoughlin, head of advocacy and communications.  From YANI, I welcome Ms Caroline Redpath and Mr. Martin McMullan, assistant directors.  I have a great preamble ready about what the organisations do, but I will discard it as the delegates will give a presentation on the good work in which they are involved.<\/p><p>  I advise delegates that when I invite them to make their presentations, they will be protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only comments and evidence related to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>  Before I call on Mr. Gilmore to start proceedings, I will give the delegates an idea of the committee's approach.  We sit once a month, but we also do a bit of outreach work and try to visit Northern Ireland.  Recently, we visited Unionist, loyalist and Nationalist communities in east, north and south Belfast.  We still need to conduct an evaluation, which we will do in private session after today's presentations.  Our visits were interesting.<\/p><p>  We are concerned about the issues on the ground.  While driving home to Donegal last Thursday, I came across 16, 17 and 18 year olds in Omagh.  Matters are not pigeon-holed into Belfast.  We are quite concerned about the entire dynamic and questions will be asked at this meeting in that regard.<\/p><p>  I invite Mr. Gilmore to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300003#B00600","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355400000,"counter":679,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us to attend.  It is a pleasure for Youth Work Ireland to be present alongside our Northern partners, YANI.  I will provide an introduction to our organisation.  I am the president and a volunteer.  I was young when I took up my post, but now that I am hitting on 25 years of age, I am moving on a little bit.<\/p><p>  We are a national organisation and the largest youth work organisation in Ireland, comprising a federation of 22 regional youth services.  What makes us unique is that our focus is very much on the local.  We pride ourselves on being local services led by local people that come together as Youth Work Ireland on a national footing to work collectively, to ensure young people have a voice nationally and to ensure the best service provision for them.<\/p><p>  It is difficult to make estimates, but we work with approximately 100,000 young people through a number of programmes and projects.  We have approximately 450 clubs and projects, but our services also work with young people one on one and through other fora.  We try to promote an integrated service and ensure any young person who approaches us has the service he or she needs, be it focused or universal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300003#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Gilmore","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355400300,"counter":681,"content":"<p>The partnership between the two organisations is based on a strategic plan and agreement.  It is very substantial in terms of meeting and progressing work.  We have a very strong focus on front-line work with young people in communities, and although teams and managers meet to speak about the type and quality of work, we also run direct programmes.  For example, I have provided the Chairman with information about the Irish Youth Music Awards, which has over 10,000 people from young bands in local communities participating North and South of the Border.  Ms Redpath can speak a bit more about an apprenticeship programme for youth workers, run directly for young people who wish to pursue a career in youth work on both sides of the Border.  A while ago Mr. McMullan and I were strongly associated with exchange work involving young people North and South of the Border and people in the south-west Balkans in Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.  That took in the lessons of conflict and its impact on young people.  There is a significant level of direct work ongoing, which we hope is one of the strong outcomes of the partnership.<\/p><p>  In considering the committee's agenda, it may wish to examine the common challenges faced by young people in youth unemployment.  There are large numbers of young people who are not in education North and South of the Border, and we have had much discussion about that.  We are trying to raise political engagement in young people, and there is an active voices of youth group, with young people engaging directly with policy makers.  That is consistent with the national children's strategy and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  In the North there is a Let's Talk initiative, which is similar, and we are trying to bring those together as much as possible.  There is much going on of great relevance, and even in the area of health and well-being we have always tried to highlight issues about young people's mental and physical health.<\/p><p>  There is a North-South dimension to that as well, and we often hear North-South trade cited as a reason not to take action on issues such as alcohol and tobacco pricing.  The World Health Organisation advocates a public health view and I know there have been meetings between the Ministers North and South about those  issues.  We encourage the committee to take an active interest in that so that the Border is not used as an excuse not to take effective public health measures on behalf of young people, for example.<\/p><p>  It is 15 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  In working together and as institutions mature and relationships improve, we should look for more dedicated space for young people in those institutions and in civic society engagement.  Even if we want to put forward joint initiatives and measures, it is very hard to find a space to do so.  There is no North-South body in this area, and the only opportunity for co-operation is in the education field, and even that tends to be very limited in what can be done.  We are working together on a North-South basis and coming across many issues but we are scratching the surface.  It is very hard to find institutional space and, related to this, it is very hard to find the funding base to do that work.  We are robbing Peter to pay Paul even in doing the most basic or rudimentary work.  The committee should think about whether there is a way of supporting such work on a North-South basis.  There are one or two small programmes but we are merely scratching the surface and doing some very basic things.  We are dipping in and out but there should be a greater space for young people and youth organisations in the institutional framework, with some type of improved funding base for working together for the future of young people.  That would be a valuable outcome from this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael McLoughlin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355400300,"counter":682,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for having us here today.  I will provide a brief insight into Youth Action Northern Ireland and some of its key work.  Ms Redpath will take us through aspects of employability in young people and some key issues for the future.<\/p><p>  Youth Action Northern Ireland, a charitable regional voluntary youth non-governmental organisation in the North, has been around for between 65 and 70 years.  Like Youth Work Ireland, our strategic partner, we are a membership-based organisation.  We have regional bases across the North in Derry, Enniskillen, Armagh, Ballygawley, Kilkeel, Newry and the hub in Belfast.  We are based in these locations but we also prioritise work throughout the region, including Border counties both North and South, with a range of programmes operating across them.  <\/p><p>  The organisation is based primarily on research and needs assessment, working in partnership with local communities.  Our practice develops through evidence-based need, and we are a practice-based organisation that builds the capacity of the youth sector in the North.  We are also strategic in working across Departments, taking in health, education, employment and learning.  We contribute to policy discussions and involve young people in engagement with politicians and as my colleague mentioned, we are looking at Let's Talk programmes, where young people can come together on a range of issues to debate with politicians.  Our work is very much about education and a community-based approach.<\/p><p>  I will speak about peace and reconciliation before handing over to my colleague.  Reconciliation issues are a priority this year for the committee.  We are working with young people on the ground on the issue of peace education and the legacy of the conflict, and a sentiment that arises is that it is always in the back of people's minds.  There is not the same level of shootings and bombs but in the back of young people's heads, it is there consistently.  This may relate to safety of movement in school or leisure services, for example.  There is now an issue with flags in the North, which is contentious, and we must engage with young people on it.<\/p><p>  We live in a segregated society, with segregated housing, education and leisure services.  Even still there is segregated employment.  The challenge is to work with young people to try to help them develop critical minds and meet young people different from themselves.  They should learn to appreciate the diversity in Ireland beyond the traditional Protestant-Catholic population, and we have many minority ethnic communities.  We must take in how to approach broader diversity in a range of issues.  According to researchers in Queen's University in Belfast in 2009, 75% of young people expressed a fear of travelling to another community, whether for education, employment or social friendships.  That means three quarters of young people still feel very frightened with regard to mobility.  One of our executive members, who works for the Northern Ireland Tourist Board spoke recently about young people from the South, particularly Dublin, who are still frightened to come to the North and Belfast because of the legacy of the conflict and fear for safety.  That is how young people feel.<\/p><p>  The Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and BBC worked on a legacy pack a number of years ago, and we were able to hear and read the stories of mostly adult civilians and those involved in the armed conflict.  What was missing from that pack was the voice of young people.  We have been trying to capture the voice of young people through publications, with an example being Peace and Quiet, Noise and Riot.  It sums up the very volatile position in the North, where we can be living with peace and quiet and believe everything is okay, with something erupting because of volatility, leading us to feel we are going backwards rather than forwards.  We must try to capture the voice of young people so others can listen to what is going on.<\/p><p>  Some 82% of young people in a Community Relations Council 2009 report cited that they believed community relations between the two primary communities would be better if there were projects to address community relations.  However, in speaking to young people about community relations, there is often a disconnect and they can feel it is not particularly relevant; it may appear that they are apathetic and it has no impact on them but that is not true.  We must keep the work real and relevant, helping young people to provoke curiosity and break down attitudes and barriers.  We should help young people to come together through contact, paradoxical curiosity and inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin McMullan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355400900,"counter":684,"content":"<p>As Mr. McMullan said, Youth Action is a practice-based organisation and employs people to work directly with young people in communities.  He has also talked about some of the programmes we deliver.  We have key priority areas of work and I shall highlight a couple of programmes that we deliver on a cross-Border basis with Youth Work Ireland.  Like the South, we have a high unemployment rate in the North, with one in five young people out of work.  The committee showed a particular interest in this issue during its recent visit to the North.<\/p><p>  Mr. McMullan talked about the cross-Border apprenticeship programme which employed 43 young people from across Derry-Londonderry, Donegal, Monaghan, Fermanagh and Belfast for 18 months.  They completed a level 3 youth work apprenticeship programme which was recognised by the Department of Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland.  Obviously, they accessed a training grant, but we secured external funding from the International Fund for Ireland and <font color=\"#262626\">The Atlantic Philanthropies.  Both organisations have been very supportive.  <\/font>A key aspect of the programme is to increase the employability of young people.  Obviously, they learn about turning up for work on time, how to fill in time sheets and about youth work.  The programme delivers good and effective youth work opportunities to young people.  As Mr. McMullan said, it is about young people learning about life, helps them to be hopeful, optimistic and interested in their surroundings and encourages them to participate in their community and community events.  The good thing about the programme is that young people can avail of a community placement and thus become involved in youth work.  Obviously, they must do so to gain their qualification.<\/p><p>  Another key aspect is that we introduce all of the themes of peace building.  The publication at the back of our legacy pack has been a great resource for us.  As members will be aware and understand, we need people to tell each other their story, understand it, know how they feel and their attitude to various matters.  Mr. McMullan highlighted the flags issue.  Our document has been a brilliant resource for us, as it helps young people to tell their stories but also to listen to others.  At the back of the publication there is a list of shorter programmes for young people that last for 16 weeks.  They focus on the large numer of young people who are not in employment, education or training, which is a major issue for us in the North.  We go through a process with these young people and try to engage them.  We try to get them interested in undertaking a lot of confidence-building work, in addition to completing short qualification courses and learning essential skills.  This is all done to give them confidence in learning and prove to them that they have an ability to learn. A lot of these young people would have issues such as to do with drugs and alcohol and we use specialised services to provide support for them.  We also provide mentors on the programmes who work with them to help to plan and take responsibility for their learning.<\/p><p>  A lot of our work is focused on the employability of young people.  As Mr. McMullan and Mr. McLoughlin have highlighted, we provide a lot of support and try to get young people to engage in the political process.  In the North 56% of young people in the 17 to 25 year age group are not registered to vote.  It is very important, following the Good Friday Agreement and with a devolved Administration, that young people become engaged in politics and understand how it works.  We also want them to become interested in local issues.  Even though the statistics show that 75% of young people are not interested in politics, once my organisation engages with them they do become involved in local campaigns.  For example, road safety is an issue in County Fermanagh of which Ms Gildernew will be aware.  We have also got young people involved in larger campaigns in respect of public transport.  The young people concerned worked with Translink which resulted in a discount card being provided for young people up to the age of 23 years.  We can see how motivated young people are on such issues separate from a party political system.  As Mr. McMullan said, part of our work involves giving hope to young people about their future, increasing their employability and confidence in what they can do and how they engage with others, thus building a better and more peaceful society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Redpath"},{"type":"speech","time":1355400900,"counter":685,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.

I especially welcome Ms Redpath because I have worked with her previously.  I thank the delegates for their presentations in which they covered a lot of bases.  I know the difficulties surrounding young people who are not in employment and training.  It is hard to reach young people, especially those leaving care and in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.  There are many issues facing young people but one of the greatest is access to transport.  At the end of Ms Redpath's presentation she talked about the Translink discount.  A lot of young people do not have access to public transport because they live in a rural community.  The greatest obstacle is to get to their nearest town to catch a bus.  I have worked on the issue of rural transport and tried to ensure young people can access it.  Young people with disabilities find it a particular problem, while young people are excluded from many activities because they do not have access to transport.  For example, young people in Garristown cannot access services in Enniskillen because it is too far away.  Our challenge is to make services more accessible and that campaign must continue.  Many young people feel disenfranchised in more ways than one because of access issues.  I appreciate that there is co-operation in this regard, but it could be enhanced and thus benefit young people across Ireland.<\/p><p>  It is my party's policy to reduce the voting age to 16 years.  We also believe it is important to have young people engaging at 14 and 15 years of age and talking about who they want to vote for.  By the time they reach 18 years they may be a little jaded and cynical about politics.  It is also important that young people have their electoral mandate recognised.  Changing the voting age would be a huge step and a vote of confidence in our young people who get a bad press most of the time.  Things are tough and I am not only referring to drugs and alcohol but the cost of insurance.  <\/p><p>  I am particularly concerned about young people who discover that they are gay.  Statistics show that a young male will keep his homosexuality a secret for five years, or between the ages of 12 and 17 years.  That must be a lonely place for such individuals to be in.  I ask the organisations present to keep up the good work, but I also ask them to examine the issues of isolation and living in a rural community, especially for hard to reach and vulnerable young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300005#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Gildernew, MP, MLA"},{"type":"speech","time":1355400900,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late, but I had to attend another meeting.

Obesity is exerting huge pressure on people and the health service.  What do the organisations think politicians should do?

Youth Work Ireland has almost 5,000 clubs mainly located in rural parts of the country; for example, Kildare Youth Services has between 20 and 30, while in County Donegal there are up to 50.  These clubs are critical to the life experiences of young people.  It is possibly their only opportunity on a Friday night to meet their peers, relax and engage in some positive learning also.  Often in social policy the emphasis is on investing in programmes that work with young people who have difficulties or that see young people as a problem that must be solved.  Instead, both of our organisations make it clear that we work using what we call an asset base approach, which simply means we see young people as a huge resource, hugely resilient and more than capable of organising their own lives and communities.  They really want to be part of the community and clubs are a very important part of that dynamic.  I come from a rural village and 30 years ago was involved in my local club.  We had the GAA and the local youth club.  We were all involved in both, but those who did not like sport got involved in the youth club.  It was a hugely important part of our community and I have no doubt it shaped who I am today in terms of the work I do and the values I hold.  Organisations such as ours which support the training and development of volunteers to facilitate these clubs are critical.<\/p><p>  With regard to youth political engagement, we would certainly welcome a debate on the age at which young people can vote.  In the recent referendum we lobbied for it to be held on a Saturday and welcomed the fact that it was.  Despite the fact that the number who voted was not as high as we would have liked, we continue to be of the view that it is critical for youth participation that Saturday voting continue.  It means young people can get home from college and become engaged in the process.<\/p><p>  My colleague, Mr. Gilmore, will talk about the LGBT issue, while Mr. McLoughlin might deal with some of the health issues.  My colleagues from Northern Ireland might speak about third level education and the Balkans project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300006#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Burke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355401500,"counter":689,"content":"<p>Mr. Burke spoke about the local youth club being important in rural areas.  We lobbied for youth club support not to be touched in the budget and welcomed that it was not.  However, a minimal amount of money is given to rural youth clubs which are led by volunteers like me in local communities who give up their time for young people.  It is a hugely important area which needs investment and support in order that it can continue to flourish.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the projects in which we have engaged to access local people, one project was very innovative.  Kerry Diocesan Youth Service has a mobile youth caf&eacute; which it built from scratch.  It travels around some of the rural areas that do not have a youth project or youth caf&eacute; to provide services.  Again, it was a youth-led initiative whereby young people were able to interact and design the idea.<\/p><p>  It is welcome that the LGBT youth work issue was raised.  Youth Work Ireland has a network of 12 LGBT youth projects.  My engagement with Youth Work Ireland at a primary level was in setting up, as a volunteer, an LGBT youth project with Youth Work Ireland in Galway.  It was when I worked in the equality area in the university.  It is a huge sector.  There are numerous pieces of research on young gay men, gay women and transgender people and the issues of coming out, gender identity, the difficulties in that regard and the importance of trying to provide social support.  Our organisation is the primary provider of LGBT youth services through our strategic partners BeLonGTo where funding is channelled, but there is still no mainstream funding for regional LGBT youth work services.  Our approach, like that to all our projects, is to engage LGBT young people as part of an integrated service within these specialised projects.  They engage in the service as a whole.  A big concern for us is that because the money has dried up, in essence, for many of our projects, particularly some in Donegal, Galway and Waterford, there is no funding available.  They are trying to fund-raise, scrimp and save and take money from other projects to support these highly vulnerable and at risk young people who have a huge amount to give.  It is just a question of adding that support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Gilmore"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355401500,"counter":690,"content":"<p>It is hard to know where to start on the issues of health and well-being.  The idea is that the journey of 1,000 miles starts with one step.  To highlight one area in the presentation on alcohol policy, for example, we have done a great deal of work on the issue during the years.  There is a template available, for which the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, has responsibility - the last Minister of State, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, did a great deal of work on it in the South - based on WHO research and years of discussion with a number of players.  The issue now is implementation and delivering things that have been well researched, proved and signposted.  We would like to see progress being made in this discrete area.<\/p><p>  On a broader level, there are a number of issues such as transport and so forth.  From our point of the view, the participation of young people in decision making is crucial.  We are involved in running D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g and Comhairle na n&Oacute;g which are very good initiatives, but we need more and better ones.  We certainly support the widening of the franchise, but there is the issue of registering to vote, as 18 to 25 year olds have the lowest rate of registration.  They also have the lowest turnout in elections.  Our statistics office carried out a study about ten years ago.  The rate of registration and participation in the political process increases sequentially every ten years.  The highest participation rate in voting and registration is among people over 65 years, while the lowest is among 18 to 25 year olds.  We must lance that boil.  The registration process in the South is an absolute disaster.  It is like an obstacle course.  If one moves and changes address, it involves getting bits of paper, filling them in and bringing them to a Garda station.  It is crazy, given that one can do most other things online such as banking and buying airline tickets.  We must think about making the process much easier.<\/p><p>  With regard to decreasing the voting age, for some bizarre reason, there was a consensus among campaigners that we should reduce the age to 16 years, but suddenly it is 17 for the constitutional convention.  I do not know why or whose idea that was.  Young people are not involved in the constitutional convention.  They are effectively excluded because the citizens involved in it will be selected from the electoral register.  We hope to do something about this to involve young people directly.  We have to walk the walk on the issue of participation.  We talk a great deal about it; there is lovely talk about getting young people involved and telling them they are great.  However, they become very frustrated at being led up the hill on something and then seeing no delivery or action on it.  The voting and constitutional convention are good examples of this.<\/p><p>  A number of years ago we met a Minister of State to discuss the issue of alcohol and the State's response.  The meeting was held in the Department of Health on the fourth floor of Hawkins House.  We asked the officials if they had consulted or involved young people in these decisions but they had not.  Interestingly, the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs was located on the fifth floor.  The Minister had responsibility for the national children's strategy which states young people should be involved in decisions that affect them.  The strategy had not even moved down one floor in the lift, let alone out into the community and among decision makers.  There is still a huge amount of work to be done in that regard.<\/p><p>  The final point is on education and training.  I urge people not to lose sight of the vocational space.  Third level is hugely important, but even today there was an announcement about cuts to post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses.  These courses are very important for young people who are not going on to third level but who have an average leaving certificate and want to get on in life.  Many of our members are involved in delivering Youthreach and community workshops in conjunction with F&Aacute;S or the new structure of education and training boards.  With the concept of a European youth guarantee, we want to see more young people having quality options in the education and training areas.  We must have vocational spaces, what was seen as traditional F&Aacute;S provision, and PLC courses, as well as third level places.  Today's news regarding PLCs is very disappointing in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300006#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael McLoughlin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355402100,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I would like to pick up on a point made by Ms Gildernew.  I compliment previous speakers on what they have said.  I am delighted Ms Gildernew mentioned the LGBT work that is being done.  As part of the current policy in Northern Ireland with regard to education and youth work priorities, it has been suggested that youth work should be confined to those aged 21 and under.  As Ms Gildernew said, it sometimes takes young people five years to come out.  That gives us another reason to argue in favour of being allowed to continue to work with young people until the age of 25, at least.  Given that approximately 60% of LGBT young people do not have a single adult they can talk to, it is not surprising that young gay men are five times more likely to attempt suicide, or that 30% of young people in the LGBT community engage in self-harm.  We should acknowledge that.  Youth Action Northern Ireland and other organisations like the Rainbow Project are running programmes in the North to deal with these issues.  Those who work with LGBT young people help to address issues such as diversity.  An expert approach is not required.  We need to treat the person like a human being.  It is a question of having a humanitarian point of view.  We do not need experts who send them to various projects.  Those involved in education and youth work often feel they do not have the skills to work with LGBT young people.  There is nothing different about them.  They have exactly the same needs as other young people, but they feel that extra levels of pressure and suppression are imposed on them.<\/p><p>  Deputy Feighan expressed some interest in the work we are doing in the Balkans.  Care International is our partner, and that of Youth Work Ireland, in the Balkans.  It is a well-recognised organisation that works in areas of conflict.  It tries to work at many levels.  Approximately six years ago, we embarked on conversations with Care International about the Balkans.  At a time when countries like Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia were emerging from conflict, we felt we could do something in the Irish context.  I refer to Northern Ireland in particular.  It is a question of two areas that are emerging from conflict.  We looked at gender-based work and gender-based violence because we felt we had that in common.  Much of the work we have done with Mr. McLoughlin in the South has involved looking at the role of young men in violence.  We have reflected on the invisibility of women and young women throughout the conflict, when young men were more visible on the streets as defenders of communities and protectors of identity.<\/p><p>  When we became aware that a similar concept was being developed in the Balkans, we organised study visits through the British Council and the Youth in Europe programme.  We received support from Irish Aid at a later stage.  That enabled us to embark on study visits.  We went to the Balkans to have conversations and dialogues with practitioners on the ground there.  We also discussed policy.  The people in question came here subsequently.  That has developed into ongoing annual exchanges, whereby young people from Dundalk, Dublin, east Belfast and south Armagh go to the Balkans to meet other young men and compare their experiences of conflict and everyday violence.  They have travelled to places like Sarajevo, Vukovar, Belgrade and Zagreb.  That has resulted in conferences and seminars on the island of Ireland and in the Balkans.  The President of Croatia came to our Belfast offices, which was really exciting.  He launched the initiative and gave the programme his endorsement.  Our next step is to look at it from a female point of view.  We want to work with young women on issues like gender-based violence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin McMullan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355402100,"counter":692,"content":"<p>I want to say a couple of things about third level education.  Ms Gildernew spoke about the issue of transport.  One of the recommendations made in our report related to the introduction of the iLink card.  Other recommendations focused on young people in rural areas and the need to examine how local transport systems can be better integrated with Translink services.  We recommended that no young person should live more than two miles from a bus stop.  We said that cycling would help young people to be fitter and healthier.  Young people have pointed out that safer roads are needed in that context.  We are working with the Consumer Council for Northern Ireland to implement a number of our recommendations.  We would be keen to get the support of this committee to help that process.<\/p><p>  We can work on a number of aspects of the issue of mental health and young people.  I refer to the school curriculum, for example.  We need to put more pressure on the formal education sector to educate young people about positive mental health, with specific regard to the things young people can do for themselves to ensure they have positive mental health.  There should be a particular focus on the activities young people are involved in and on their relationships.  We have recently been involved in a couple of initiatives that have focused on the use by young people of social media such as text messaging.  When young people become engaged with our programmes, we get their consent to send a positive mental health message to them.  We do that on a regular basis.  The message could say something as simple as \"do something for yourself today\".  It could be a nice thought about something.  We are trying to help young people think about the small things they can do for themselves and about how they engage in their activities and relationships.<\/p><p>  I would like to conclude by speaking about third level education.  I have already spoken about our apprenticeship programme.  The level 3 diploma in youth work that our young people complete is recognised by the University of Ulster.  It gives them access to the community youth degree programme.  Our work in this area focuses on young people who have not achieved what they might have needed from the formal education system.  We try to develop their capacity to get higher education places, which might be limited for a number of reasons.  While qualifications are important, we often have to start by developing people's confidence in their ability to access third level education.  Many of them are in the first generation of their families to go to university.  Their families would not have had a history of going to university.  That has been our particular focus in terms of third level education.  Obviously, the number of places available to young people is a key issue, particularly in light of budget reductions.  We have been campaigning on that issue with a focus on young people who leave the education system without many qualifications.  There is a large gap between young people who do well and achieve brilliant things and those who are not in employment, education or training and have a low level of qualifications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Redpath"},{"type":"speech","time":1355402100,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I admire Youth Work Ireland and Youth Action Northern Ireland.  More than 350,000 young people in the South are catered for by youth work services.  Approximately 1,400 people work in full-time equivalent positions in the youth work sector.  There are over 40,000 volunteers in this area, which is a huge amount.  I am sure the ratio is the same in the North.  Much of this work, although not all of it, is done in deprived communities and with socially disadvantaged young people.  Those who provide youth work services are sometimes the only positive role models in these young people's lives.  We need to support the two organisations that are represented at today's meeting.<\/p><p>  I was very interested to hear Mr. Gilmore mention the mobile youth cafe.  There are 70 youth cafes in this country.  Some &euro;2 million has been provided in the budget for up to 100 more youth cafes.  Would Mr. Gilmore agree that they seem to be taking over from the youth information centres to a certain extent?  The youth cafe in my own village, which is near Dundalk, is a very positive thing.  I will come back to Dundalk, south Armagh and east Belfast, which have been mentioned.<\/p><p>  The members of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement are quite interested in North-South links.  While I was interested to hear what was said about the strategic plan, I would like to hear more about how these links are developing.

We could spend the entire morning discussing the impact of cuts on young people.  I am impressed with the results achieved by the youth organisations which have come before us.  We have heard, for example, that 86% of youth work apprentices secure employment and that 72% of young unemployed people on the REACH training programme progress to employment.  These are positive and impressive figures.<\/p><p>  I am surprised at the high proportion of young people in the North who are not on the electoral register.  Is the position similar in the South?  The political parties have tried everything to persuade young people to register for elections, from knocking on doors to canvassing in colleges.  According to the survey mentioned, young people feel disillusioned, disenfranchised and disconnected from politics, but they are also interested in politics.  This appears to be a contradiction. <\/p><p>  Comhairle na n&Oacute;g is a youth organisation in the South.  Is there a similar organisation active in the North?  It is important to have young people meeting and talking to one another.  It will be the younger generation, rather than my generation, that will advance reconciliation and peace building.  I hope we will be able to build on the changes made.  While there is common agreement that this is the way forward, increasing co-operation will be a challenge.  It will be achieved by spending small but important sums of money to foster such engagement.<\/p><p>  What are our guests' views on getting young people involved in politics?  How can young people be persuaded to register for elections?  It has been suggested PRSI numbers could be used to automatically register voters.  Has this proposal been discussed?  Youth groups in my area have been involved in trying to persuade young people to register.  <\/p><p>  I am not surprised young people are afraid to go into other communities.  This is a generational issue and I suspect family members tell young people not to go into other communities.  Young people in parts of Tallaght in my constituency are nervous about going into other estates.  For example, young people in Jobstown will be nervous about going to Killinarden and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  One will hear young people who are hoping to get a house say they do not want to move to a particular area, which may be only across the road.  The reason may be that they would feel uncomfortable living in the area or do not have family links with it.  While the problem is bigger in the North, it is also present in the South.<\/p><p>  One of the positive outcomes of the peace process is that young people from different communities are starting to go out with each other and breaking taboos by going back and forth between communities.  While there have been difficulties in recent weeks, we can move on.<\/p><p>  I congratulate the youth organisations on the work they are doing.  If they have suggestions on what Members can do to assist them, I would like to hear them, especially with regard to structures.  The peace process has not been successful in including civic society, especially young people.  The Oireachtas has opened up to Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  Could the Assembly take a similar step?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300008#G00200","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1355402700,"counter":696,"content":"<p>I apologise for being a little late.  Please feel free to interrupt if I ask a question that has been answered.<\/p><p>  I am stunned by the figure showing that 56% of those aged between 17 and 25 years in Northern Ireland are not registered to vote.  I spoke to a trade unionist in Australia where voting is compulsory.  While I have never advocated compulsory voting, it could be a long-term strategy because the person with whom I spoke told me it worked in Australia.  Political systems gravitate towards those who tend to vote, namely, the middle class, the wealthy and older people.  Finance is never directed towards areas and age groups which do not use their franchise to the same extent.  Is there potential to have a conversation about moving towards an understanding of how different international electoral models have worked?  The trade unionist indicated that voter turnout in the most disadvantaged areas which was traditionally poor had changed completely and that the political system was moving towards meeting the needs of this section of society now that it was much more engaged.  I ask our guests to comment on this issue. <\/p><p>  On the attitudes of young people to voting, I am involved in a project with transition year students in local secondary schools.  It is related to the constitutional convention and known as the &quot;Convention in Your Classroom&quot;.  I find it remarkable that students in only one of the schools I have visited as part of the project are in favour of lowering the voting age.  They are all <i>au fait<\/i> with social issues and happy to voice opinions on them.  However, they told me that young people under the age of 18 years did not understand or have an interest in political issues, although they tended to be more in tune with what was going on when they reached 18 years.   I was surprised that young people of 16 and 17 years were not eager to get involved in politics and have their voices heard.  Perhaps there is a disconnect between them and the political system.  The problem that arises when the political system tries to fill this gap is the contamination effect created by political parties becoming involved in voter registration.  There is a danger that politicisation will take on a party political dimension. <\/p><p>  I am not sure if the issue of integrated schooling has been discussed.  The committee has received a number of presentations on the issue and I am aware the various churches are not keen on the idea.  We also received a presentation from loyalist community leaders, one of whom was strongly opposed to the idea of integrated schooling.  While the Republic does not have a great record on integrated schooling, we are moving towards a model of diverse school patronage.  Is the fact that children from different religions do not attend the same schools part of the problem in the North?  <\/p><p>  On the most recent violence and the discovery that 13 year old children were involved, time and again we have heard that those in their mid-teens and early 20s have no idea what happened during the Troubles and have a sense that they missed out on some of the action.  I am not trying to be dismissive or insulting, but that is the feedback we received from some community leaders.  I ask the delegation to comment.<\/p><p>  Literacy, knowledge and learning are surely the most fundamental building blocks for anyone to be able to engage in the labour market or improve himself or herself in education.  The statistics for literacy in the North are probably similar to those in the South, especially for young men who have a difficulty in this regard.  Perhaps the delegation might comment. <\/p><p>  The sexualisation and commercialisation of young women is not a problem exclusive to Northern Ireland or the Republic.  Having taught in a primary school for girls for 11 years, it is my view that young girls' sense of themselves and their place in society has regressed.  They are very much aware of their sexual power at a much earlier age.  Commercial interests demand that childhood be shortened in order that they can make money out of children as commercial entities.  A 12 year old who should have five or six years of childhood left is now deciding which boy band member she fancies, which make-up she should wear and what colour her hair should be.  Does the delegation wish to comment on the sexualisation of young women and the fact that they are contextualising themselves in terms of their sexual power?  I find that women and young girls are in a less positive place than they were ten, 15 or 20 years ago when, for example, Mary Robinson was elevated to the Presidency.  I do not know if the organisations have tapped into that area or if they have a comment  on it.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300008#G00300","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1355403300,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I apologise for the fact that we have been in and out this morning owing to votes in the House and the fact that we have had to meet ICBAN Limited, another cross-Border organisation.  I welcome the delegates.  It is great to have this exchange of views and to commend and salute their work.  President Higgins' recent initiative of regional assemblies of young people culminating in an assembly within &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in was hugely successful.  What was remarkable at the last session was that the young people advanced a knowledge-based excellent set of proposals.  That makes me believe, as Mr. Michael McLoughlin said, that young people should have an input into the constitutional convention.  I concur with that view and wish him well.  If the committee can help in any way it would be delighted to do so.  The question is how to organise the input.  Any of the young who spoke at the final session in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in who represented the regions could reasonably make a presentation of great excellence and maturity to the constitutional convention.  In fact it might well put some of the adult contributions in the shade.  As I had a personal interest in it, I watched the entire proceedings, which were excellent.  Linked to that area is Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g, about which Deputy Crowe asked if there were similar assemblies in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>  There is great potential in all of these organisations.  I have personal experience as I have a teenage son who is involved with Comhairle na n&Oacute;g which has been transformational and excellent for him.  He has benefited hugely from it.  It is very enjoyable for him and his associates.  They have a round of social activities related to it as they do active community work.<\/p><p>  It is clear to me as a parent and a former teacher and from observation and through constituency work that young people need confidence, that is, inner confidence and self belief.  That is how to tackle substance abuse and many of the issues correctly identified by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in about the position of young women and the attempt to exploit them commercially.  Confidence is a major issue.  All of one's activities help to contribute to building confidence which is a major issue. That leads to my last point, that the enemy of confidence is youth unemployment, the crisis with which we are confronted which is at 30% and is a huge challenge to us all.  Without wishing to be political, I commend the Minister on job activation and the fact that 10,000 new places are available for community employment, through social employment schemes and so on provided for in the budget.  I hope the delegates will tap into that area and have an input into identifying schemes in which young people can be involved and an involvement in the running of youth caf&eacute;s.  For example, a young person on a community employment scheme could assist with the running of a youth caf&eacute;.  That has been an issue in some instances.  Senator Jim D'Arcy mentioned the huge significance of youth caf&eacute;s and their attempts to deal with substance abuse, the confidence and so on.  There has been an issue in a few places in regard to continuing to run youth caf&eacute;s.  There may be potential within the community employment schemes or the social employment schemes to do something in that regard.  I would be interested to hear a comment on that. <\/p><p>  My last point, although basic, merits repeating on every occasion, that is, that the young need confidence.  That is the reason I was delighted with the impact of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g for my son.  If they have confidence everything else will follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300009#H00200","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1355403300,"counter":698,"content":"<p>We are under pressure timewise.

Senator Jim D'Arcy kicked off the issue.  Clearly he has a deep knowledge of the sector, the sheer number of young people who are engaged and the number of volunteers and staff.  The sector is giving value for money.  I am aware of a discussion in the Seanad last night on a report produced by the National Youth Council of Ireland which studied the value for money of youth work.  For very little money in the overall scheme of things all of these programmes are delivered locally in all communities.<\/p><p>  On the issue of youth caf&eacute;s, obviously we welcome the investment from the Government.  Unfortunately, it is primarily capital funding.  One of the key challenges, as Deputy O'Reilly mentioned, is how to staff these and resource our volunteers.  Organisations such as ourselves put a good deal of time and energy into making sure that volunteers are Garda vetted and that child protection measures are in place.  Obviously that is critical but it comes at a cost.<\/p><p>  In regard to the strategic plan which we share, it is a great idea and we are delighted to have it but perhaps the committee might think about how it could help us resource it a little more.  Again we are talking about relatively small amounts of money but were the two organisations able to meet and plan much more strategically and in detail, the effect at grassroots level would bear fruit.  There is money available but it is around the grassroots work.  If we were able to strategise around that area with a little money at management or organisational level that would make a huge difference.<\/p><p>  Mobility is a critical issue.  We must find ways of promoting mobility between both jurisdictions among young people.  Something like the Irish youth music awards is one way of doing that where we have bands coming from North and South.  It is not just the banks it includes all their crew, their background and their family.  That programme is delivered for about &euro;30,000 and there are 10,000 young people involved in it.  Is that not value for money?  That gets people moving and it gets people speaking to each other.  It creates friendships and all kinds of co-operation.  That is one example of the huge impact of a small amount of investment.  As a sector we are operating with between 40% and 50% less funding than we had four or five years ago.  That has a huge impact on the sector.  We are awake to the realities of life.  Ireland is not the same any more.  We have huge challenges.  We are doing our best to deliver on a shoestring.  The outcomes are there to be seen, they are empirically verifiable.

Deputy O'Reilly raised the issue of the importance of confidence building in young people.  I can tell the committee quite confidently that as a 25 year old man, I would not be able to sit in front of the committee were it not for the interventions of youth work.  I am sure Mr. Patrick Burke would have said the same thing 30 years ago in his youth club.  It provides the mechanisms and the confidence.  The youth workers with whom we work are doing fantastic work.  In regard to youth information centres, an issue raised by Senator D'Arcy, they are hugely important.  In Donegal we have seen the amalgamation of youth caf&eacute;s and youth information.  In some ways many of our colleagues in the sector are not engaged in youth information as their core work.  It is the core work of Youth Work Ireland.  We are the largest provider and the largest youth work organisation and it is a core and a key element.  One of the arguments is that young people get information online.  Therefore, why does one need to support youth information work?  There is a huge amount of information online that is not very good information on what youth information co-ordinators and workers can do.  Working in youth caf&eacute;s or in integrated services might not necessarily be the old hatch system we do not operate any more in Youth Work Ireland but they are able to sign post them to good information.  In regard to online work we have a strategic partnership with another national organisation, SpunOut, of which the committee may be aware.

In the voluntary youth sector, our organisation brings in &pound;9.32 for every &pound;1 we get of public funding.  We are an ambitious organisation, like Youth Work Ireland.  We are ambitious for young people and need to be in the context of the challenges facing young people currently.<\/p><p>  In terms of cross-Border work, we work together with Youth Work Ireland.  Much of our work is in the context of the movement of populations of young people into other communities to develop their confidence.  Self-confidence is a big issue for young people.  We have been recruiting young people through job centres recently for one of our employability programmes.  They felt that lack of confidence was the biggest factor in stopping them from getting work.  They did not consider qualifications or education as so significant.  Confidence in themselves and what they could do was the major factor.<\/p><p>  With regard to engaging young people in democracy, we are very interested in the Rock the Vote campaign that was part of the presidential elections in America.  We have got involved with that and believe it would be wonderful to bring that campaign to Ireland, North and South.  That campaign engages pop stars like Madonna and various others to make voting sexy and to engage young people.  These are things we have to do.  I was sent to the Department of Regional Development to promote cycling for young people, but that, like voting, is not seen as something cool.  Perhaps \"cool\" is a better word to use than \"sexy\".<\/p><p>  On the sexualisation of young women, there are a couple of factors involved here.  There is a vacuum in the North in terms of women and leadership.  Obviously, Michelle Gildernew is the exception in terms of a positive role model for young women.  We take various approaches in working with young men and women in terms of gender stereotyping.  We try to educate them through the use of positive images.  We do this in a practical way, by having them create positive images of young men and women that depart from the gender stereotype, leaving out the make-up and other ways the media suggest they should portray themselves.<\/p><p>  On the issue of compulsory voting, rather than persuading people to agree to compulsory voting, we need to nurture young people earlier.  We need to engage with them in their communities through local campaigns and to inform them of what is going on and deal with local issues like transport.  On schools, I agree these should be integrated.  This is a no-brainer.  Young people are growing up segregated and are not meeting each other until they go into higher education.  That is crazy and has a major impact on relationships in our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Redpath"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355403900,"counter":704,"content":"<p>Youth Work Ireland is under pressure to deliver targets.

We talk about youth caf&eacute;s, drama, music and all the things young people love to do, but we are not getting to do that because as a deliverer of youth work, our work is focused on that target-driven culture.  This places pressure on people to become something rather than just on being together and enjoying being together.  A recent BBC Radio 2 programme, \"Pause for Thought\", pointed out that the purpose of life is having a purpose.  Young people just enjoy being together and being happy.  That happiness, contentment and positivity breeds the sort of confidence we have mentioned and inspires them to get involved in other things, like education and employment.  As a youth sector, we need to be more inspirational.  We must get out there and have positive conferences and seminars rather than heavy doom and gloom.  We must be more positive in the sector and inspire people to move forward for a better future for this island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin McMullan"},{"type":"speech","time":1355403900,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I just wish to make an observation on the sexualisation of young women.  I agree with what is being done in this regard.  I cannot speak for the North with regard to third level education of men and women, but in Ireland significant numbers of women are entering third level of education.  Increasingly we see young women speaking on political issues on television panels.  We have a coterie of highly educated women we did not have previously.  This is fascinating.  Many young women in secondary schools now want to go to Cambridge.  This is fantastic.<\/p><p>  I accept there is sexualisation in the context of what people wear, but young women are ambitious.  Education is what it is about if we want to create self-esteem.  In general, I do not see sexualisation as a major concern, because there is evidence on television and radio constantly that our young women are highly educated and professional and have opinions on every issue.  There were not so many there before.  I admit there is a deficit of women in politics and there are only two women in the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party, which has 33 members altogether.  We do not have role models there.  However, I am not overly concerned as I do not see us being able to change early sexualisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300010#J00500","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1355403900,"counter":706,"content":"<p>Thank you.

This is an important committee on the island of Ireland because it is one of the few formal spaces where all-island thinking must be paramount.  That is important, especially at this time.  I am here to discuss my scoping study, Delivering a Prosperity Process: Opportunities in North\/South Public Service Provision.  It is not said often enough that North-South interaction has delivered substantial benefits for both jurisdictions on the island.  This is something which, perhaps, we do not appreciate or look to often enough as we consider what we have to do in this new era.  Why can I say that?  Essentially, I know this because I was there, as Max Boyce says.  In the early 1990s I first became involved in North-South economic and enterprise policy development.  When I reflect on the difference between then and now, I realise it is substantial and significant.  There is peace and there are agreements, institutions and a wide range of other interactions.  Above all, there are relationships that did not exist in the early 1990s, especially at political level and among politicians.<\/p><p>  This leads me to one of my themes today.  Given the important decisions that politicians are making this week in the Houses, typical of the choices that have to be made in these times of serious budget adjustments, it is important the relationships in place between North and South that can deliver the types of recommendations I am making are used beneficially and productively on behalf of all the citizens of the island.  I have always been involved in the thinking related to how to go about that.  New thinking is needed because we are in a new era.  The great recession has left us in a completely different place from where we were even five or six years ago.  Governments are engaged in adjustment programmes.  The report notes that in this jurisdiction we are 65% through the adjustment programme required by the troika.  The United Kingdom is only 12% through its programme.  In his budget speech the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, said that he pushed out the end of their project until the latter part of the decade.<\/p><p>  We are discussing public services.  Public expenditure is under pressure and reforms and adjustment are required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300011#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael D'Arcy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355404800,"counter":715,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. D'Arcy.

This is an area of great interest to people living along the Border.  They have been affected negatively by the lack of joined-up thinking between both sides with regard to the provision of health services, education, water, telecommunications, industrial development or the creation of jobs in the region.  Much of the focus has been on Belfast and the larger locations.  The development of prosperity along the peripheral Border regions needs a lot of work.  I am interested in teasing out Mr. D'Arcy's views on the importance of local transport networks in the peripheral regions and their effect on the development of business and job opportunities.<\/p><p>  A particular bugbear of mine is the lack of development in the local road structure between the counties on each side of the Border, between the towns of Armagh and Monaghan.  I am sure it is the same between Donegal and Tyrone in the more rural areas compared with the Derry-Letterkenny side. This development of local roads has a part to play in the creation of growth.  There is a lack of joined-up thinking between the road service in Northern Ireland and the local authorities in the Republic when it comes to the development of those local transport links.<\/p><p>  This also affects the health policy.  There have been some initiatives to develop co-operation between both health services such as cross-Border ambulance and emergency services.  Many people living along the Border on the Republic side may go to a doctor in Armagh or in Fermanagh.  When they get sick they may want to go to Craigavon hospital but the ambulance will not cross the Border so they will need to be transported by a family member.  At a practical level we need some movement in this area to ensure these people are not inconvenienced in this way.  This is a very important report which I look forward to reading in depth.  I may revert to Mr. D'Arcy to tease out some points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300012#L00300","speaker":"972"},{"type":"speech","time":1355404800,"counter":717,"content":"<p>I am conscious there may be a vote at 2 p.m. so I will take a group of questions together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300012#L00400","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355404800,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. D'Arcy.

He referred to John Compton's Transforming Your Care programme.  Enniskillen has a new state-of-the-art hospital with the potential for cross-Border working in co-operation with Sligo and Cavan hospitals.  This is not an attempt to empire-build but rather we have an opportunity to provide a quality service for people living in that region.  However, there is an issue because that hospital is not recognised by the health insurance companies.  I commend Mr. D'Arcy's report and I suggest it is circulated to all Departments, North and South with a note requesting Departments to provide a response to this committee on how they propose to address the recommendations outlined in the report.

I also welcome his presentation and the report.  Like Deputy Conlan, I intend to read the report.  We suffer overloads sometimes, as the Chairman will confirm.  We are in receipt of so many documents on a given day and, sadly, one cannot read them all.  However, in this case it is incumbent on us to read and study it because of the region we represent.  I see merit in what Deputy Conlan said about follow-up discussions with Mr. D'Arcy as we read the report.<\/p><p>  I will focus briefly on the area of cross-Border co-operation, the economy and the prosperity agenda that everyone can buy into, to use that phrase.  Tourism holds great potential.  We have lakeland areas and heritage sites which have been under-exploited.  There is a potential to create a branding for the area to market it abroad more effectively.  We have more potential to market our Border area.  There may be a need for some flagship events.  I refer to the impact of the all-Ireland Fleadh Cheoil held in Cavan which is difficult to quantify.  Apart from its cultural and aesthetic merits which are unquantifiable, there is the purely economic impact with &euro;40 million coming into the area as a result.  We need to look to organise flagship events in the Border region and also to create marketing brands for the lakeland areas.  We seem to have missed out down the years.  We may be the Cinderella area in terms of the national tourism product and tourism numbers.  We have been on the periphery.  Our Chairman's County Donegal would not have suffered to the same extent.  However, in the other Border counties we are on the periphery in terms of marketing for tourism purposes.  I refer to the beauty of the Cavan-Louth area and the Fermanagh-Tyrone area.  The attractions offered by those areas were not packaged very well over the years.  I look forward to Mr. D'Arcy's comments in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300012#L00800","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1355405400,"counter":722,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. D'Arcy and thank him for his contribution.  I regret, however, that it seems unlikely his report will be given any real, serious consideration in the course of this meeting.  I accept that we are operating under time constraints, but it seems clear to me that the committee needs to be allowed time to give the matter further consideration.  The form that consideration might take can be discussed in private session.  By allocating only today's meeting for discussion of the report, we are not giving it due attention.<\/p><p>  What stands out from Mr. D'Arcy's statement is his indication that all participants in the study agreed that opportunities for cross-Border co-operation in the provision of public services are being under-utilised.  He referred to several areas in which there is potential for practical co-operation, including higher education.  There have been some positive developments in this area recently, such as the co-operation at ministerial level in respect of the survey on small schools in Border areas.<\/p><p>  Mr. D'Arcy also observed that 90 years of development has resulted in an ingrained institutional separation of public services which has the potential to block the types of initiatives he discusses in his report.  We must give careful consideration to how those difficulties can be unblocked.  Would he recommend, for example, the establishment of additional North-South bodies, for which there is scope under the Good Friday Agreement?  Earlier in this meeting we discussed the opportunities for co-operation in the area of youth work.  Is that an area in which Mr. D'Arcy sees scope for enhanced co-operation under the terms of the Agreement?<\/p><p>  In regard to the overall response to his report, North and South, will Mr. D'Arcy indicate whether any individual Departments in either jurisdiction have acted on any of its recommendations?  I presume, after all, that he wrote the report on the basis that there would be follow-up on those very clear recommendations.  Have Departments been in contact with Mr. D'Arcy to discuss how they can best move forward in this regard?<\/p><p>  Finally, I would appreciate if Mr. D'Arcy could expand on the economic development zone issue.

In case I did not mention it earlier, I should say that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is the supporter of this study.  It was commissioned by the CCBS and it is important to put that on the record.  When I was preparing this presentation and the fact that it was to be made to the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, I reread the Agreement, particularly the declaration at the start of it.  I took note of the wording of what was the task of the Agreement and I give a few selected references from it.  It states: &quot;We are committed to partnership ... between North and South&quot; and &quot;we will endeavour to strive in every practical way towards reconciliation and ... agreed arrangements&quot;.  In responding to the questions, I would like members to keep that sense of agreed arrangements in the back of their minds as to what this committee and politicians in general can do.  Ultimately, when one talks about public service provision, one is talking about matters which are under the discretion of politicians and of Ministers in exercising power.  If we are to have two jurisdictions co-operating with each other, we need agreed arrangements.  In terms of the &quot;what can we do?&quot; question, which is always the first one that should be tackled, agreed arrangements are perhaps a good starting point.<\/p><p>  I was just talking to Michelle Gildernew about the question of health and health insurance and I will start by dealing with that question.  We are talking about the NHS and the HSE in any agreed arrangements.  I am often amused when those in the South talk about economies of scale.  If we think about the NHS and about the HSE, the economies of scale are the other way around.  The benefits from this jurisdiction plugging into the NHS is to plug into those economies of scale, as they are deployed within Northern Ireland.  That is the perspective to which we need to get used.<\/p><p>  The question of insurance goes to the heart of the matter when we think of what we insure against and it is against the occurrence of a catastrophe.  My life is insured.  When one talk about health insurance, there are two aspects.  One is if something goes wrong and the other is the payment mechanism when one is getting something done.  If one thinks about both, co-operation, or even co-ordination, will not be enough.  These arrangements will include collaboration.  When something goes wrong, it cannot be a case of: &quot;Would you like to look into that, please?&quot;  People have to come and work together to figure out how this can done.<\/p><p>  In a Border context, are there different arrangements for different parts of the Border? This is a point Michelle Gildernew raised.  Is there one arrangement in Enniskillen hospital, another in Altnagelvin hospital and another in Daisy Hill Hospital?  How does that make sense?  The arrangements must be co-ordinated and coherent between all the facilities.  That is the only agreed arrangement that fundamentally makes sense, namely, that some basic principles would guide the application of the insurance right along the Border.  What was mentioned in the Compton report in this respect?  It was the fact that there happen to be three acute hospitals in the Border region on the Northern side of the Border whereas they do not have a mirror in the South.  The acute hospitals are further south.  For the convenience of people in the Border regions, tapping into that economy of scale makes a good deal of sense.  The Compton report is interesting in the sense that it allowed for the possibility that around Daisy Hill, unless patients were coming from the South to it, it would not maintain its position in terms of economies of scale within the Northern system.  That is a real challenge and opportunity in the South to put the agreed arrangements in place that would make that happen.<\/p><p>  What is the role of politics and politicians in this?  It is to sit on that in a way, to keep asking the questions whether we should have those arrangements, where they are, how we can put them in place and how they should happen.  We are not the experts, we need to be given the answers and then we can evaluate.  That is the reason this forum is so important because the members bring both sides of that equation together.  If we were in the other committee rooms with just the public health forum operating in the South, we would get only side of the equation.  Here we have the opportunity to bring the two sides together and to seek co-ordination and coherence between them in terms of all along the Border and not just in the middle, the north west or wherever.  That is an interesting question but these are tough challenges and they are complex.  If one were to ask administrators to do this, they would have a lot of work to do.  I will come back to that question in terms of the administration and what that might involve.<\/p><p>  The benefits are clearly evident.  If one looks from the top down, in terms of the element of the health budget that is within the discretion of the Northern Ireland Administration, if economies are scale are dependent upon usage, then across the health system there are benefits form acute hospitals down to centres catering for specialist conditions.  If one decides to set up centres to cater for specialist conditions on this island, be it cardiac care, a very rare form of cancer and let us say there are 100 sufferers, on the law of averages, ten of those will be in the North and 90 will be in South.  There is a choice for the patient and his or her family.  If the specialist centre is set up in the South, the choice is if they wish to have treatment in London, Liverpool or Manchester whereby they would have to board a plane or boat or if they wish to get into a car and drive North and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  A centre of excellence is being developed in Belfast, involving Queen's University and Belfast City Hospital around cancer care.  Is there a benefit in the South in being able to plug into a UK centre of excellence by driving in a car for the two and half hours to the North instead of boarding a plane or a boat? These are the practical issues that need to be injected by politicians into the more complex challenges of the two entities, which are engaged in enormous internal reform process and have many other things on their mind.  Unless this is pushed, I fear it will not happen.<\/p><p>  Another way this can happen is through communities.  General practitioner services are driven by patients.  As I understand it, the NHS is moving towards a more GP-paid-by-patient model, more like the model we have here.  That puts the power somewhat into the patients' hands.  If communities in the Border regions can come together to drive this again from a bottom-up approach, that would be helpful as well.<\/p><p>  In terms of the study, it is proposed that someone should put forward a plan to do this.  There should be a plan somewhere.  If one wants to implement something, one needs a plan.  Who will be responsible for that, where is the plan, how can it be done, what are the issues around it, what are the costs involved and what are the benefits?  Those are the practical suggestions made in the study.<\/p><p>  I will move on to tourism and the issues raised were interesting.  All the conversations I had were informal - Chatham House rules.  There was a sense that we have structure in that Tourism Ireland sells Ireland across the world and invites people to come to Ireland and in that way it increases its share of the pie.  We also have F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and they compete for their share of the pie.  Structurally, one might say that is not optimal.  In answer to the specific question of how do we get around that, my practical suggestion was to ask can we move beyond the agencies to the people in the field, the providers of tourism products and services.  I thought back to the late 1980s.  Unfortunately, I can go back that far.  For a long time the tourism industry had depended on coach tours from UK and there was a desire to increase tourism from the Continent.  The industry commissioned research and asked people on the Continent what they wanted, what would bring them here in the first instance, and what would have to be invest in to provide an experience that would be worthwhile for them to travel here.  It is time to go back and think about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2012121300014#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael D'Arcy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355407200,"counter":737,"content":"<p>As much as the members, including me, would like to contribute further, we must acknowledge that we are under pressure as there is another meeting.

We will address those issues today.  My colleague, Professor Gallagher, will provide an update on the national clinical programmes and the work that is being undertaken in conjunction with Ms Mary Godfrey.  Phenomenal work has been done over the past year and that will continue.  Professor Gallagher will give a comprehensive update.  It is important to watch the patient care pathway, which will assist in the patient's journey from diagnosis through to the necessary care.  Mr. Jermyn, chief executive officer of St. Vincent's Hospital, will outline the issues that surfaced in the media and the representations that were made to Oireachtas Members about St. Vincent's Hospital.<\/p><p>  I wish to reaffirm the HSE's commitment to working with the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland and with the clinical programmes, as well as with St. Vincent's Hospital, to ensure a comprehensive, high quality care pathway is in place.  The partnership approach we have taken to address the issues surrounding admission and discharge at St. Vincent's Hospital has been ongoing for the last couple of weeks.  Hopefully, we will conclude our discussions with all parties by next Monday week.  I will revert to the Chairman on that.<\/p><p>  As members are aware, cystic fibrosis is the most common life threatening inherited disease, primarily affecting the lungs and digestive system.  Ireland has one of the highest reported incidences of CF in the world.  One in 19 of the Irish population is a carrier of the disease, and the incidence of CF in Ireland is almost four times the average rate in other European countries.  At present, there are 1,136 individuals registered with CF in Ireland, of whom 594 are adults and 477 are children under the age of 18 years.  The prevalence of the disease will increase as the rate of survival improves.  While the number of children born with CF every year is anticipated to remain stable, the number of adults with CF is increasing.  This results in increasing numbers of adults requiring health care services each year.<\/p><p>  I wish to refer to newborn screening before handing over to Professor Gallagher to outline the excellent work that is taking place on the programmes.  Then Mr. Jermyn will contribute, because it is important that people are reassured about the work being undertaken by the management of St. Vincent's Hospital.  An important and significant issue is the screening of newborns for cystic fibrosis.  This is covered on page 4 of the document given to members.  This was introduced on 1 July 2011 and is an integral component of the newborn blood spot screening programme called NNBSP.  It is anticipated that between 40 and 50 infants with cystic fibrosis will be identified each year.  The introduction of the screening will result in earlier diagnosis and there are significant benefits for children and families as a consequence.  Any infant who is identified as having a high risk of cystic fibrosis is referred to one of the six specialist centres - Cork University Hospital, the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick, University College Hospital Galway, the National Children's Hospital in Tallaght, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin and the Children's University Hospital in Temple Street.  Babies diagnosed through newborn screening have improved nutrition, improved lung function and fewer admissions to hospitals.  They require fewer antibiotics, which is really important, and have improved surival.<\/p><p>  The rest of the report is in the submission.  At this stage I will ask Professor Gallagher to give an outline of the programme.  It has been a significant work in progress and it is important that members of the committee get an overview of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012121300003#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry O'Dwyer"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355391000,"counter":748,"content":"<p>I appear before the committee as the clinical lead for cystic fibrosis nationally.  In doing so I am really appearing on behalf of the CF carers of Ireland - the nurses, physiotherapists, dieticians, psychologists and doctors who are involved in CF care.  I have the role of clinical lead for the HSE, but I appear on their behalf.  I will give the committee a brief overview and I will be happy to address any questions or comments from members afterwards.<\/p><p>  Members already have a very good summary of the national issue.  There are approximately 1,150 people with cystic fibrosis in the Republic of Ireland.  One in 19 of us carries the CF gene and roughly one in every 1,400 live births has cystic fibrosis.  Those are the bare statistics, but they do not address the issue that for each person with cystic fibrosis there is a family and community affected by it.  The good news story is that CF is changing.  Twenty or 25 years ago cystic fibrosis was always a severe disease in childhood and very few people lived to adulthood.  Things are changing.  There are now slightly more adults than children with cystic fibrosis.  In childhood cystic fibrosis is generally mild, with some exceptions.  Most children are treated as outpatients, with intermittent hospital stays.  However, once they reach the age of 18 to 20 years, the disease becomes somewhat more severe because they have had the disease for longer.  I must emphasise that there are people in their 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s with cystic fibrosis.  They are in every walk of life.  Our oldest patients are in their 60s, so things are changing.  However, that means the need for care is changing as well.<\/p><p>  As people have the disease longer in adult life there is a greater focus on hospital care.  We really have a partnership between the CF patient community, the CF carers whom I represent, the HSE, the hospitals and the Government.  Things are moving on.  There are a number of CF centres throughout the country and they are working in collaboration at all times.  There are major centres around the country.  The national adult centre is in St. Vincent's Hospital but there are also adult centres in Cork, in Limerick which caters for the Tipperary, Limerick and Clare area, and in Galway.  In Dublin there is St. Vincent's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital.  There are also other smaller centres.  In paediatrics we have units in Cork University Hospital, Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick, University College Hospital Galway, in Drogheda, Waterford and in hospitals in Dublin.  All of these hospitals and centres work together.<\/p><p>  The spectrum of care always encompasses outpatient care and inpatient care but the focus or balance changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012121300003#E00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Charles Gallagher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355391600,"counter":750,"content":"<p>Perhaps Mr. Jermyn would update the committee on the circumstances surrounding admissions to St. Vincent's University Hospital and the action being taken by the management of the hospital in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012121300004#F00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355391600,"counter":751,"content":"<p>It is important that on behalf of the HSE I acknowledge the major work undertaken by Professor Gallagher on its behalf and the phenomenal support we have received from Mr. Philip Walsh and the Cystic Fibrosis Association nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012121300004#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry O'Dwyer"},{"type":"speech","time":1355391600,"counter":752,"content":"<p>We all concur with Mr. O'Dwyer's remarks in regard to the work being done in this area by Professor Gallagher, whom I thank for his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012121300004#F00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355391600,"counter":753,"content":"<p>On behalf of St. Vincent's University Hospital, I would like to reiterate our commitment to the statement to which we signed up with our colleagues in the HSE and the Cystic Fibrosis Association.  It is important to say that the State has invested &euro;7.7 million in the construction of the cystic fibrosis unit, the operational cost of which is &euro;7 million per annum.<\/p><p>  I would like to comment on recent statements in the public arena.  On 23 November 2012, which was the Friday prior to the Monday and Tuesday on which the publicity occurred, there was a major outbreak of winter vomiting bug in many wards at the hospital, resulting in the closure of many areas to new admissions.  Having said that, there were no patients awaiting admission on Saturday, 24 November.  On Monday, all cystic fibrosis patients requiring hospital care were being cared for in the hospital.  It is important to state that on the Monday there were 29 CF patients in the hospital, 24 of whom were located in the new Nutley wing.  Other patients were located in other medical facilities because we could not put patients at risk of infection together.  There are a group of patients who have CF who cannot be located with other patients, including on the same ward.  <\/p><p>  At 4 p.m. on Monday, 29 November, following clinic, an additional number of patients required admission.  Of those six patients, three were offered beds in single rooms but not in the Nutley wing.  One of the patients could not remain on that day and was taken in the following day.  This was against the backdrop of the hospital and the accident and emergency department being full.  On the Tuesday night, we admitted all those patients who had not been admitted on Monday night.  On Tuesday at around 6 p.m. the medical team was informed that we were in difficulty with beds.  Following a further clinic, an additional four patients required admission.  We managed to find a bed for one of those patients.  It was then decided to send the remaining patients home and to have them admitted the following day because we did not have the facilities required.  At that stage, we had 29 CF inpatients.  By 12.30 a.m. on the Wednesday, all patients requiring admission had been admitted.  We flexed up our beds from 20 to 33.  As I said, not all patients were accommodated in single en-suite rooms in the Nutley wing, but of the 33 admitted, 24 were in the Nutley wing and nine were placed in other units around the hospital.  While most were in single en-suite rooms, one patient was in a single room which did not have a bathroom attached.  <\/p><p>  As we speak, there are 28 CF patients in the hospital.  I am pleased to say that all but one of those patients are in the Nutley wing.  The person not in the Nutley wing is located elsewhere due to infection risk, and it is hoped to have that patient accommodated in the Nutley wing by close of business today.  I take this opportunity to thank Professor Gallagher and the consultants and nursing staff, who are working extremely hard.  We have 45 other key specialties in the hospital.  It is important we get our cystic fibrosis services right because we are the hub for the region and the country.  I do not propose to say any more on that issue.  I hope I have explained the situation.<\/p><p>  We are in dialogue with the Cystic Fibrosis Association and work in partnership with it.  A liaison committee meeting is due to be held tomorrow.  We are considering the escalation policy in the hospital specific to cystic fibrosis and our criteria for admission and discharge.  We need to communicate more effectively with the patients who do not get care as urgently as they would like.  I want to reassure our population of patients that if they are critical they will be admitted.  A patient who arrived at the hospital the other day in a critical state was taken care of.  It is important that patients come to the hospital, as they do for all of the other specialties.  I do not deny that we are challenged at times.  The statement commits to our flexing our beds from ten to 34.  We have not yet hit the target of 34 but we did, as I said earlier, reach 33.  We have a day centre with ten individual rooms.  If we cannot get a patient admitted during a particular day we will commence treatment in the day facility and will in an appropriate amount of time have him or her admitted.  We admitted all patients within 24 hours and as such did flex up.  However, it was not immediate and we are looking at how we can improve on that in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012121300004#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicholas Jermyn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355391600,"counter":754,"content":"<p>We have been in dialogue with the hospital and the association.

One of the very encouraging aspects of this engagement is the evident cohesion across all of the interests represented this morning.  This is to the credit not only of Professor Gallagher and his team but also of Mr. O'Dwyer and his colleagues from the Health Service Executive.  It is not always the case that there is a clear, united and determined approach to address problems within the health service.  It is a great comfort to us that there is such a consensus in this instance.<\/p><p>  There has been a tremendous focus recently on the care of cystic fibrosis patients and the Nutley wing at St. Vincent's Hospital, in particular.  I am particularly interested in the care of children with cystic fibrosis which is currently provided at Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin.  I understand the facility can cater for up to 140 patients.  However, the number of dedicated stand-alone room facilities to provide for inpatient care is much smaller.  The committee has not yet been given a profile of the component parts of the proposed national children's hospital.  Do the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland and all of the interested parties represented have an understanding a dedicated cystic fibrosis unit will be an integral part of that facility?  Moreover, is it their expectation that such a facility will cater for an increased number of inpatients, commensurate with the response at St. Vincent's Hospital for adults?<\/p><p>  It is hugely important that there be as early a diagnosis as possible for cystic fibrosis patients.  I do not claim expertise in this area; my knowledge is based mostly on my limited exposure to cystic fibrosis sufferers on a one-to-one basis.  My understanding is that because the condition is genetic it is perhaps identifiable even before symptoms present because there is a readily identifiable cohort of those at risk or at greatest risk.  The earliest possible intervention, even before symptoms present, is hugely important in the treatment of cystic fibrosis in the lifetime of a sufferer.  I am very interested in the delegates' observations in this regard.<\/p><p>  Mr. Jermyn has indicated that following the meeting of 3 December, it was agreed to have a follow-up meeting in a fortnight's time.  Will he confirm whether the meeting which he indicated is taking place tomorrow is the follow-up meeting signalled?  In regard to the 34-bed capacity of the new Nutley ward, he suggested one or two beds would always be available.  In the light of the developments that will come on stream from February next year, I can envisage a situation where the word \"always\" comes under at least one question.  My concern is that there will always be an unexpected level of demand such that it is not always possible to ensure one or two beds will be available.  In measuring this need is there a sense that the current provision is measured appropriately in terms of the response needed to cater for the numbers that do and can present?  We must avoid a repeat of the situation in the recent past where there were five refusals.  I do not use that word to be provocative and should perhaps say five patients could not be admitted.<\/p><p>  We in this committee are all of one mind to lend our support to the delegates in ensuring cystic fibrosis sufferers are offered the very best support by the health system.  That is our purpose as elected representatives and members of the committee.  I thank the delegates once again for their attendance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012121300005#G00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1355392200,"counter":757,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Dwyer, Professor Gallagher, Mr. Jermyn and their colleagues for agreeing to attend this meeting at such short notice.  The motion my colleague, Senator Jillian van Turnhout, and I brought forward arises in the context of recent reports in the media, our specific objective being to discover whether current practices are in line with agreements made in April 2011 and July 2012.  The issue was also raised by our colleague, Senator John Crown, in the Seanad.<\/p><p>  I very much welcome the delegates' outline of the current position and ongoing developments, the approach of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland and the general approach to the care of cystic fibrosis patients.  Professor Gallagher, in particular, has offered significant grounds for hope.  Before conducting my research, cystic fibrosis was not a disease with which I was very familiar.  I was particularly saddened to discover that the oldest sufferer in Ireland was only 62 years of age.  However, I am hopeful in terms of the vision that has been set out, the research being carried out and where we are moving towards to in terms of early diagnosis and reforming the provision of the ongoing and complex care required.  All of this is very much to be welcomed.  I also appreciate the delegates' acknowledgement of the bravery of patients and their families, a point on which we are all in agreement.<\/p><p>  Mr. Jermyn outlined the latest developments and gave us the relevant figures.  As I understand it, within the particular week to which reference was made, there may have been instances where it was found that aspects of the agreements and statements devised in respect of the partnership approach could not be put in place.  Will Mr. Jermyn clarify whether the required one to two inpatient rooms in the Nutley wing for emergency admissions were, in fact, available?  It seems there were 20 inpatient beds utilised, but the agreement indicates that this can be flexed up to 34.  From what Mr. Jermyn said, however, it appears that this could not be done on one occasion during the week in question, whether for one day or some other length of time.  Will he clarify whether that was the case?  Have there been other occasions on which the hospital has not been able to implement the agreements and statements put in place?<\/p><p>  In his first major public statement on the matter the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, indicated that the provision of 34 beds was agreed to and should be available.  In reading through the statements and agreements, however, it is not absolutely clear to me that there is a specific commitment that 34 beds - in single isolated rooms with the appropriate staff and equipment, in accordance with international standards - will always be available.  Will Mr. Jermyn indicate whether it is the intention to include that absolute commitment in the agreements?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012121300005#G00300","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355392800,"counter":759,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has already asked a question regarding the new national children's hospital and the connection with Crumlin hospital, and I was going to ask something similar.  It is a good news story that people are living a little bit longer, but do they have the necessary services?  In recent years, I have met only two people with cystic fibrosis.  One is a young lad who lives beside me, and the other is a young girl whose baby was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.  Within 24 hours of the baby having been born, her life changed because she got the sad news.

For a cohort of approximately 340 adult cystic fibrosis patients there should be 34 beds.  That is what is needed and any departure from 34 beds is a departure from international guidelines.  The figure of 34 beds was agreed, but 24 designated beds were delivered and an additional 14 single inpatient rooms were promised.  Where are they?  Do they exist?  The hospital in which I work has patients with complex illnesses who have a known requirement for single rooms with isolated toilet facilities for people with MRSA, VRE, ESBL-producing bacteria and the various vomiting bugs, including the norovirus which has been prominent recently.  In addition, because of general medicine, there will be a requirement for single isolation rooms for patients who are disturbed or terminally ill and whose families need to be beside them without having large numbers of other people present.<\/p><p>  There will always be a demand for beds in single rooms in the hospital.  It requires clarification, therefore, when the HSE says it is giving 20 of the 34 because it will designate 14 others.  One would have thought, at a bare minimum, that if we were designating 14 additional beds from outside the specialist unit, the requirement that there would always be one or two inpatient rooms available for emergencies would be respected.  Were the bed managers instructed to protect those 14 beds and then particularly to protect the one to two inpatient room beds?  I would like some clarification on that.  Has any attempt been made to ensure that when the 14 beds are activated they are actually segregated, and that the staff there have some facility, experience and expertise in dealing with patients with cystic fibrosis with particular needs?  <\/p><p>  Patients with cystic fibrosis are appropriately quick to point out deficiencies in their own care.  That is because they are good at it.  As Professor Gallagher told us, they have been going through this all their lives.  They know if somebody makes a mistake or if the nurse dealing with them is inexperienced in cystic fibrosis.  They also know if a doctor is not following the hygiene procedures that doctors dealing with cystic fibrosis patients must carry out.<\/p><p>  Have we got a guarantee that if these beds are not all in what - let us face it - should be a 34-bed unit or they are not all in the 20-bed unit, there is at least an appropriate level of step-down of expertise, concentrated geographically, for the other 14 beds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012121300006#H00300","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1355392800,"counter":761,"content":"<p>I welcome the visitors and thank them for their informed submissions.

As in all of these issues, however - including our meeting here today - the devil is in the detail.

We have a liaison committee that meets with the Cystic Fibrosis Association representatives, some of the patients and the medical and nursing staff at a local level on a regular basis.  That meeting will take place tomorrow.  The meeting to which Mr. O'Dwyer referred is the national meeting with the HSE, the hospital, Professor Gallagher and Dr. Edward McKone of St. Vincent's Hospital.<\/p><p>  In respect of the ward block, St. Vincent's Hospital was opened in the 1970s and the old-type wards were in existence.  The concept of the ward block was that we would create 100 single-room <i>en-suites<\/i> to cater for a number of patients.  Senator Crown referred to various specialties and patients who require isolation in bathroom suites.  This unit was opened and two of those floors were dedicated to CF patients.  We have 45 different specialties, 550 beds and 126 single-bathroom <i>en-suites<\/i> in the hospital.  There is a concentration in the Nutley wing and, obviously, CF patients have a dedicated 20-bed unit into which nobody else goes.  We have not put other patients into it even if the beds are vacant.  The day facility below that unit has ten <i>en-suite<\/i> single rooms and is used for day care and patients for whom we are trying to find beds.  <\/p><p>  An issue related to the statement issued and to which we are committed was the flexible use of those beds.  We do not need the 34 beds all year round but there are certain times, particularly coming into the winter, when there is a need to increase the number of beds.  In respect of the one to two emergency beds, we are guaranteeing and working with the Cystic Fibrosis Association to ensure that at least one of the beds in the CF unit in the Nutley wing will be made available and kept for emergencies.  When certain types of CF patients are admitted, they cannot be put with other CF patients.  When we refer to the one emergency bed that is guaranteed in the Nutley wing, there are situations when, although we always try to admit the most sick CF patients to the actual ward itself, we cannot always put them into that unit for clinical reasons so we must find the other most appropriate place to put them.  As Senator Crown said, we want to ensure that they are placed in an area where the nurses and staff are familiar with treating these patients and that is what we have in the overall hospital situation.  There are other areas where we cannot accommodate certain CF patients in the dedicated unit and we then look to the acute respiratory unit.  There are one or two other areas in the hospital we have designated.  We have not been able to guarantee single-room <i>en-suites<\/i> in all areas because of the design of the hospital and we are working to escalate our policies.  <\/p><p>  We are devising our current practices.  We have been in the new unit since July and we have developed the day care unit.  I know it was referred to as the register of patients.  Over 60% of all adult CF patients attend St. Vincent's Hospital but there are other centres around the country that have been developed and have evolved.  What we need to do is flex and work with the specialists.  There are other cystic fibrosis consultants appointed in other centres around the country.  As the hub centre, we will try to ensure we can accommodate the most sick patients and maximise the efficient use of the day centre in St. Vincent's Hospital and the other centres around the country.  I understand that 315 patients are registered with us, of whom about 20% come from outside Dublin.  We need to see whether we can maximise the facilities.  <\/p><p>  We are challenged at times with many of the other specialties we have.  We are the lead centre for many cancers and other specialties.  As indicated, we need single rooms for these patients as well.  We have allocated 26% of the 126 cubicle <i>en-suite<\/i> bathrooms for dedicated use by the CF patients.  The hospital admits over 100,000 patients per year and 400 of them are CF patients.  We are doing our best and sometimes it does not always meet the requirements.  The purpose of looking at international standards is also to look at developments in care, drugs and medicines.  There have been significant developments in the way we care for CF patients, including identifying them at a younger age and treating them earlier, and we should learn from them.  We have found different ways of dealing with different types of patients coming in with CF.  There are different levels of emergency.  Some patients need to be admitted immediately, while others need to be admitted soon.  We are working on that and will discuss it with the Cystic Fibrosis Association so that when we do have-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012121300007#J01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicholas Jermyn"},{"type":"speech","time":1355393400,"counter":776,"content":"<p>Have representatives from the hospital met the association since the incident?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012121300007#J01100","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355393400,"counter":777,"content":"<p>Yes, we have and will follow up matters next Monday.

One of the Senators asked how we were going to move forward and review this.  The point of the national programme is to link the hospitals that provide the service to the front line with the staff and the national groups.

Professor Gallagher and I are old friends and colleagues and I have limitless respect for what he has achieved with the CF patients and, more broadly, in upscaling the quality of respiratory medicine in this country.  Does he believe, as is being billed to us, that 20 designated beds plus competitive access to the pool of single rooms in the hospital is putting us in an adequate situation to meet international guidelines or do we need to bite the bullet and have 34 designated beds?  Is he happy that decisions with respect to whether he should be re-referring patients back to other centres and not letting them stay in the national centre are being followed?  Is he being put under any pressure to depart from what he believes is the right way of handling these issues?<\/p><p>  I will make a brief statement.

Patients coming from other centres for a second opinion go back to the other centres.  We are resourced for that.<\/p><p>  The Senator's second question was as to the whereabouts of the other 14 rooms.  I cannot answer that.  My answer to his question about what I would recommend might not make me popular but I recommend that there be an allocation of rooms for people with cystic fibrosis.  Twenty is not enough.  The other ones should be allocated in one area and if they are not used by CF patients they should be used by other patients.  That is the situation.  I fully support responding to other patient needs but the issue now is to have the CF patients in one area where there is availability, expertise and nursing staff.

I emphasise that following an afternoon clinic one might have five patients who are told they need to be admitted.  We are working out a process whereby patients with an urgent need do get in.  Then we are able to get patients appropriate beds within 24 hours.  In the two days we spoke about we admitted two patients per day whose needs were urgent.  There were other patients we would like to have admitted straightaway but we took them in the next day.  In the Nutley wing we try to admit all patients.  Once a patient is admitted to the Nutley wing, outside the cystic fibrosis unit, in the other five ward areas we have accommodated a cepacia, cystic fibrosis patient on each of those floors.  We cannot then put any other cystic fibrosis patient on those wards.<\/p><p>  We are studying the infection control measures.  As a result of the way the wards are designed, there are two sides to them, we may be able to put another patient in.  That means we have further accommodation available.  We can put patients with certain infections together.  That is what we are studying now.  I stress that there have been times when this issue has not received the same media attention.  We were flexing and we took in patients on the night when five patients were waiting.  We had them all in by the next day.   We had four new patients the next day and we got two of them in.  We have to work through this issue with the CF Association, the individual patients and their families to see how we can best use the resources available to us.  It is difficult in the evening when the accident and emergency unit and other specialties are pushing for resources.  We did sign an agreement with everybody that we would flex the beds up.  We have run into difficulties from which we will learn.
