The combined wholesale and retail sector employs almost 273,000 people in Ireland &ndash; that is almost 15% of our total workforce.  <\/p><p>  In recognising the importance of the sector to the economy, the 2012 Action Plan for Jobs signalled out the sector as one with employment potential and contained a number of measures aimed at supporting the retail sector specifically. <\/p><p>  We have also introduced a number of initiatives of particular assistance including:<\/p><p>  - Reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% on a range of labour-intensive services, with a particular focus on the hospitality sector.<\/p><p>  - Introduction of the Credit guarantee scheme<\/p><p>  - Reform of wage setting mechanisms<\/p><p>  We are also working to reduce the level of compliance on small businesses, and as part of the Action Plan for Jobs developed the business regulation website and aim to deliver a 25% reduction in administrative burdens imposed on business and enable online compliance with regulations where possible. In addition, initiatives by the Companies Registration Office regarding online filing and the forthcoming Companies Bill will ensure a more efficient operating environment for enterprise.  During 2012, an audit of 159 licences for key sectors was conducted which identified potential to reduce considerably the burden of compliance with licenses.

Annual costs in respect of quite a low level of intervention in the export credit market would be about &euro;1.7m and this cost would rise significantly, if higher risk profile exports were covered.  In addition, it was found that such a scheme would be of very limited impact, and that a negligible number of jobs could be connected with such an initiative.

I understand that this situation has arisen due to difficulties across its operations in the UK and Ireland, arising from dramatic changes in the way music and films are bought and sold.<\/p><p>  On becoming aware of the evolving situation in the company last week, I asked the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) to contact the workers involved in the sit-ins and to mobilise NERA resources to answer queries from all workers on their employment rights.    <\/p><p>  My Department established a direct line of contact with the receiver from the outset and I was assured that communicating with staff would be a priority.  I understand that, over the weekend, the receiver secured the agreement of staff to discontinue their sit-in in return for his commitment to arrange for payment of wages this week.  The receiver has indicated he is making every effort to find a buyer for the Irish operation.  I understand that the receiver has issued employees with letters notifying them that they are on temporary lay-off, pending an outcome to his efforts to secure a buyer.  Redundancy notices have therefore not been issued to the employees. <\/p><p>  In general terms, I would note that under the body of Irish employment rights legislation there are significant protections afforded to employees whose employers are insolvent and as a result default on payment of wages.  If an employer is unable to pay wages and\/or redundancy payments, employees are entitled to apply to the Social Insurance Fund - which is administered by the Department of Social Protection - for payment of the amounts otherwise due from the employer.  These rights are contained in the Payment of Wages Act 1991, the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Acts 1984 - 2006 and the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 - 2007.  The scheme applies to employees employed in Ireland in insurable employment whose employer is insolvent, as defined under the scheme.  Entitlements are based on pay up to a maximum weekly rate of &euro;600.  There is a limit of eight weeks&rsquo; pay for arrears of pay, sick pay or holiday pay.  Monies owed up to the appointment of the receiver are secured by the Social Insurance Fund.  Monies owed and earned after the appointment may be claimed through a Rights Commissioner under the Payment of Wages Act, who will adjudicate on the matter.  Additional protections afforded by the Protection of Employment Act 1977 (as amended) and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act are also of relevance.  The Protection of Employment Act contains provisions requiring an information and consultation process that must be entered into with employee representatives prior to collective redundancies being implemented.  An employer is prohibited from issuing notices of redundancy to employees during the mandatory information and consultation period.  Remedies are provided for in the legislation in respect of breaches of these requirements.  The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973 entitles an employee to notice of termination of employment of up to 8 weeks, depending on the length of service of the employee.  A situation of temporary lay-off may impact on the application of this Act and I would urge individuals to contact NERA to establish the position regarding their rights.  <\/p><p>  Accordingly, employees left without pay and redundancy payments by an insolvent employer are protected in legislation and are entitled to receive outstanding payments from the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the current body of employment rights legislation, backed up by the information and enforcement activities of NERA and the redress available to workers through the State&rsquo;s workplace relations bodies, provides robust protection for employees, even in these very difficult circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400047#WRA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prompt Payments","counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400047#WRA01250"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[3314\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400047#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the measures he will take to ensure that small and medium enterprise receive prompt payment for their services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1096","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[3243\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400047#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his plans to reduce the 62 day average payment delay culture in Ireland which is having a large negative effect on small business.","asker":"1102","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":20,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 55 together.  <\/p><p>  Prompt Payments for goods and services rendered is critical to the effective working of any economy and is an issue on which this Government places great emphasis.<\/p><p>  In an effort to help ease cash flow difficulties for Irish small businesses operating under the current economic environment, while at the same time setting an example for businesses in the private sector to improve their payment record by paying each other more promptly, Ireland has introduced, on a voluntary basis:<\/p><p>-  A 15 days prompt payment requirement for all central Government Departments to pay their business suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice.  This arrangement applies to all valid invoices received on or after 15 June 2009;<\/p><p>-  A similar arrangement has now being extended beyond central Government Departments to our State Agency Sector to include the Health Service Executive, the Local Authorities, State Agencies, and all other Public Sector Bodies, (with the exception of the Commercial Semi-State bodies).  These new arrangements apply in respect of valid invoices received on or after 01 July 2011.<\/p><p>  The most recent set of composite figures published are for Quarter 4 2012 and show that 98% of Government payments, valued at &euro;1.25bn, were paid to suppliers within 15 days.  The Quarter 4 2012 returns also shows that 93% of Agencies&rsquo; payments, under the remit of my Department and valued at &euro;53.9m, were paid to suppliers within 15 days.  This clearly shows that central Government Departments, Bodies and Agencies and Local Government continue to comply with the Government requirement to pay business suppliers within 15 days of receiving a valid invoice.<\/p><p>  My Department promotes improved payment practices and monitors the operation of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997, and the Late Payment in Commercial Transactions Regulations 2002. <\/p><p>  At Present the issue of late payment is covered by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 388 of 2002).  Under these Regulations, it is an implied term of every commercial transaction that where a purchaser does not pay for goods or services by the relevant payment date, the supplier shall be entitled to interest (late payment interest) on the amount outstanding. <\/p><p>  Ireland must transpose the Recast of the Late Payment Directive (2011\/7\/EU) which repeals and modernises the old rules.  Minister Bruton signed the Statutory Instrument transposing Directive 2011\/7\/EU was signed on 22 December 2012 and this will come into effect on 16 March 2013.<\/p><p>  The proposed legislation will act as a deterrent to late payment and as a driver for payment on time by establishing a clear expectation in law that payment will be made according to agreed terms.  It lays down the specific deadlines for the payment of invoices and establishes a right to compensation in the event of late payment in all commercial transactions, whether they relate to transactions between private or public undertakings, or between undertakings and public authorities.<\/p><p>  In practical terms, this translates into the following operational objectives:<\/p><p>- Confront debtors with measures that successfully discourage them from paying late<\/p><p>- Provide creditors with measures that enable them to fully and effectively exercise their rights when paid late.<\/p><p>  I am aware that part of the difficulty for small business relates to accessing working capital from banks.  A range of national initiatives have been developed to support the flow of credit to enterprises.  In addition to initiatives to recapitalise and restructure the banking sector, initiatives have been developed to build better business banking relationships (e.g. the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to SMEs and the establishment of the Credit Review Office).  The Action Plan for Jobs 2013 will build on the recent achievements such as the introduction of the 15 day payment period across the public sector in general and the ability for business to attach officially new payment requirements to relevant invoices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400047#WRA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1081"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Action Plan for Jobs","counter":21,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400047#WRA01525"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[3236\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400047#WRA01600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the steps taken by him to create employment of those at risk of emigration.","asker":"1028","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":23,"content":"<p>The entire focus of the Action Plan for Jobs is on protecting existing jobs and supporting the creation of new ones.

For a rounded view, it is necessary to look beyond a single set of statistics; rather one should seek an assessment of all relevant indicators for that sector, in particular, output, purchases, exports and employment. <\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to Output, both industry production and turnover (sales) are relevant.  The recent Central Statistics Office data on these two activities up to November 2012 are disappointing but there are some sectors which show encouraging trends.  The most recent data for the last quarter has shown declines in both production and turnover overall.  However, the rate of decline in turnover has been substantially less than the rate of decline in production in recent quarters.  This may indicate that the decline in sales is easing and offers hope for a return to growth in sales.  During the last quarter, increases were recorded in both the production and sales of some key commodities such as meat and dairy products, computers and electrical equipment.  <\/p><p><br \/>  A key measure of industrial performance is, of course, comparative Export data for<i><\/i>manufactured goods.  The latest CSO data shows that manufacturing exports for the period January-November 2012 are almost &#8364;80 billion, which is higher than exports in the same period in 2011.  Considering the depressed economic status of many of our key markets globally, this is a significant achievement. <\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to <i>Purchases,<\/i> the reputable NCB Purchasing Managers Index is a composite indicator designed to provide an overall view of activity in the manufacturing sector of the Irish Economy and acts as a leading indicator for the whole Economy.  After a long period of contraction (some of it very severe) for most of the period 2008 &#8211; 2010 and also part of 2011 and early 2012, this Index has recorded 10 straight months of consecutive growth, up to and including last month. <\/p><p><br \/>  Approximately<i><\/i>50,000 jobs were lost in manufacturing in the worst years of the current recession due to a variety of factors particularly the impacts of the global financial crisis and the decline in demand for Irish manufactured goods, partly linked to the decline in the construction sector.  However I am pleased to report that since then Ireland has regained some competitiveness with decreases in relative prices and that overall employment in manufacturing has been largely stable over the last 2 years at around 190,000 to 200,000, with a roughly similar number of indirect jobs supported in this sector. <\/p><p><br \/>  Industrial production is crucial to economic well-being and, using the expertise of the Manufacturing Development Forum and the development of a new Strategy for Manufacturing, we can build a sound future for Manufacturing and Industrial Production in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400048#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Direct Investment","counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400048#WRB00450"},{"type":"question","counter":37,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[3225\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400048#WRB00500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the major areas of consideration raised by multi-national corporations when considering investing in the State.","asker":"959","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":38,"content":"<p>IDA Ireland&#8217;s primary responsibility is to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and to grow and expand existing FDI companies in Ireland in the face of strong international competition.  <\/p><p><br \/>  As Ireland is no longer a low cost labour location, IDA Ireland is now targeting companies involved in more knowledge based activities that are driven by technology and innovation, with an emphasis on higher skill requirements and R&amp;D.

The aim of the Action Plan for Jobs is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016, while the objective of Pathways to Work is to ensure that as many of those jobs as possible go to those who are currently unemployed.  The Plan is a whole of Government plan with a national focus across all regions. <\/p><p>  While job creation is this Government&rsquo;s top priority and tackling unemployment is our greatest challenge, the most recent Quarterly National Household Survey showed that unemployment decreased by 3,600 (-1.1%) in the year to Quarter 3 2012, the first year on year decrease in unemployment in recent years. It is acknowledged that there are regional variances in the labour market, however, overall the unemployment statistics show signs of stabilization and some slight downward adjustment.  <\/p><p>  The Enterprise Development agencies are at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs across all regions and continue to ensure that enterprises can maximise their contribution to economic recovery and jobs growth.  Despite a very difficult domestic and external economic environment, we are beginning to see the positive impact of the Government&rsquo;s policies.  2012 saw significant net job creation by EI and IDA-supported companies, building on the positive results of 2011 and following successive years of significant net job losses.  My Department has successfully delivered on national actions, such as the establishment of the Microfinance Loan Fund and the Credit Guarantee Scheme, both of which will increase access to finance for enterprises and entrepreneurs throughout the country.<\/p><p>  Ensuring that more micro and small businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of the Government&rsquo;s plans for jobs and growth.

Pending the introduction of these arrangements, County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) will continue to ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development and engage and work with micro-enterprises employing less than 10 persons, on an on-going basis, with strong referral to sister agencies to progress the needs of the businesses in their respective areas. <\/p><p>  I am currently preparing the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government, and in that context, am exploring further measures which can be taken to transform our economy and support job creation across all regions of the country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400048#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Aid","counter":53,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400048#WRB01650"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[3194\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400048#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":" the input that members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann will have in the process of formulating the post 2013 regional aid investment guidelines.","asker":"1091","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[3193\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400048#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will outline the discussions and submissions he is having with the EU Commission regarding the regional aid guidelines post 2013.","asker":"1091","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":56,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 48 together.  <\/p><p>  The process of Member States agreeing the 2014-2021 Regional Aid Guidelines is underway and initial multilateral discussions between Member States and the Commission, which has responsibility for the Regional Aid Guidelines, have taken place. <\/p><p>  The initiative is Commission led, and my Department is actively engaged in this process and has consulted relevant stakeholders including various Government Departments, the industrial development agencies, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Forf&aacute;s, the Central Statistics Office, the Border Midland and Western Regional Assembly, the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly, and the eight Regional Authorities. <\/p><p>  The Commission issued a non paper of its initial orientations in December 2011, which was followed by a multilateral meeting in March 2012.

The research also aimed to identify any other issues or difficulties associated with obtaining quotations. One of the main findings of the research was that a significant number of small businesses do not seek quotes in advance when dealing with professions or indeed experience difficulties in obtaining quotes when seeking services from providers in certain professions. Among the professions identified as posing difficulties for small business in obtaining quotations were solicitors, banking, accountants and insurance.<\/p><p>  Arising from its research, the Agency apprised the relevant representative business groups of the research findings and in particular the finding that a large number of small businesses do not seek quotes in advance when dealing with professions.<\/p><p>  In parallel, but as a separate exercise, the National Consumer Agency has carried out a number of initiatives in the area of price display. Included in these initiatives was an agreement with the Dental Council in relation to a format of price display by dentists by means of a Code of Practice which makes it mandatory for dentists to display their private fees for certain treatments in a place where patients can read it before consultation. A standardised format was agreed in April 2011 and took effect as a regulatory requirement as part of their Code of Practice on June 1st 2011.<\/p><p>  As regards the medical profession the Agency engaged with the Irish Medical Council and the Irish Medical Organisation in relation to the display of prices by doctors, following which the IMO issued guidance to its members advising them &quot;to prominently display a price list for a range of standard consultations&quot;. The Medical Council has advised that the price list will be considered for inclusion in the revised Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners.<\/p><p>  Following a survey of child care facilities, the Agency engaged with the representative body in that sector to progress a standardised price display format for its members to display in a prominent location on their premises. A format was agreed with the child care body and introduced in October 2012.<\/p><p>  As regards legal services, which the NCA&rsquo;s research found to be the profession in respect of which customers had the highest level of difficulty in accessing quotes, the Agency engaged with the Law Society to explore initiatives which could be undertaken to improve transparency in the solicitor profession in terms of its accessibility by both consumers and SMEs. Among the initiatives discussed with the Society was the introduction of standard templates for consumers seeking a quote for three common services such as making a will, obtaining a grant of probate and a conveyance. The Agency is hoping to conclude the discussions with the Society in relation to the possible introduction of standard templates shortly.<\/p><p>  Aside from the foregoing initiatives of the National Consumer Agency, it is also essential that consumers and businesses both embrace their own responsibilities to achieve the best value for money, through for example, actively seeking quotations from service providers. The research carried out by the Agency shows that whilst there is some evidence particularly in relation to consumers being more price conscious and actively shopping around for value, a number of businesses, particularly small businesses, need to embrace their responsibilities in this area much more proactively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400049#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Guarantee Scheme","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400049#WRC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[3344\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400049#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the uptake to date of the credit guarantee scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>The Credit Guarantee Scheme went live on Wednesday 24th October.

Officials are currently looking at how to implement changes to the CRO regime, in line with the recommendations of the report.<\/p><p>  An SME Funding Consultation Committee, chaired by the Department of Finance meets regularly to examine the various issues in relation to SME credit, and to identify further actions that can be taken to address the difficulties.  Officials from my Department participate on this Committee, and a work programme for 2013 is currently being finalised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400049#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[3241\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400049#WRC00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the views of representatives of the small to medium sized enterprise sector regarding his plans to develop LEOs merged with local authorities.","asker":"1022","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":69,"content":"<p>The micro and small business sector is central to Ireland&rsquo;s overall economic recovery and future growth.

It is the largest exporter and source and recipient of foreign direct investment. Consequently, under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU, we attach great importance to promoting the EU&rsquo;s external trade agenda. The overarching theme of the Irish Presidency will be the contribution of trade to growth, jobs and economic recovery. If, as is expected, 90% of economic growth by 2015 will occur outside the EU, we have an imperative to capture the impact of this expansion for EU citizens, workers and business. In 2011 Ireland exported &euro;173 billion in goods and services (&euro;136bn to Q3\/2012, an increase of 6.18% on the corresponding figure for 2011), while total trade generated by the economy was just over 130% of GNP &ndash; one of the highest ratios in the world. This underlines the importance of trade and exports to both economic recovery and job growth in Ireland and across the EU.<\/p><p>  Two of the most significant trade agreements that will be progressed during the Irish Presidency involve the transatlantic economy. Free trade negotiations are underway and well advanced with Canada. Subject to the advice of a specialist group it might be possible to move forward with a free trade agreement between the EU and the U.S.<\/p><p>  EU &ndash; Canada<\/p><p>  The importance to the Irish economy is emphasised by the fact that in 2011, total trade between Canada and Ireland was &euro;2.2 billion. In addition, merchandise exports to November 2012 were &euro;740m, representing an increase of 32% over the corresponding figure for 2011. The EU-Canada Comprehensive Trade Agreement (CETA) negotiations are nearing a conclusion. Throughout the negotiations I have consistently emphasised to the EU Ireland&rsquo;s primary objectives in any trade agreement with Canada. These include both offers and requests to Canada in the agriculture sector, especially the beef sector, as well as other important areas such as intellectual property, investment, services and public procurement.<\/p><p>  EU-US<\/p><p>  Discussions are underway about the possibility of opening free trade talks with the U.S. Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency will prioritise these discussions and encourage other Member States to give the Commission a negotiating mandate to start talks.<\/p><p>  Improving EU-U.S. trade and investment arrangements in as many ambitious areas as possible, including services and regulatory alignment would be an exciting and worthwhile project from which Ireland stands to benefit significantly. The transatlantic economy generates $5 trillion in total commercial sales a year and employs up to 15 million workers. It is the largest and wealthiest market in the world, accounting for three-quarters of global financial markets and over half of world trade and world GDP.<\/p><p>  Other Free Trade Agreements<\/p><p>  We will also seek to achieve further progress across a range of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) currently under negotiation including with India, Malaysia and Vietnam. The trade aspect of an agreement with Singapore has been finalised and we look to advance the agreement&rsquo;s investment chapter during our Presidency so that the whole trade agreement can be finalised as soon as possible. <\/p><p>  We are also seeking to make important progress on FTAs with fast growing markets in Asia such as Vietnam and Malaysia as well as with the countries of the Eastern Neighbourhood (Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and Armenia). Talks on these are at various stages of maturity.<\/p><p>  Trade talks that have yet to start include those with Japan and Morocco, the latter economy being part of the EU&rsquo;s Southern Neighbourhood. These are expected to commence shortly and very likely during the Irish Presidency. A trade agreement with Japan would be especially attractive for our exporters as that economy is both prosperous and technologically advanced. In other words an attractive market for our high value added and sophisticated exporters.<\/p><p>  We are also seeking progress in developing the EU&rsquo;s trade and investment relationship with China following its change in leadership later this year. This will include preparatory work on a possible investment agreement with market access provisions.

In accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, IDA Ireland continues to engage with these client companies in order to transform the existing FDI base with a view to developing, retaining and growing employment opportunities. This is given particular emphasis in respect of client companies in Kerry, who are located outside of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s main Gateway locations. <\/p><p>  The provision of flexible and cost effective property and infrastructure solutions is a key aspect in developing regional value propositions and in attracting FDI. In this regard IDA Ireland will continue to market all available land and buildings in County Kerry and work with local authorities and property developers to deliver appropriate solutions in response to potential investors&rsquo; needs.<\/p><p>  IDA Ireland has indicated that, in seeking to win FDI, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of a range of professional and business support services. Ireland has only one such Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area, so, in order to achieve balanced regional economic development, the Agency prioritises the marketing of its Gateway locations within each Region e.g. the Gateways in the Mid-West and South West Regions which include Limerick and Cork as the locations of critical mass.  However, the Agency also highlights the opportunities provided by other locations such as the linked hubs in County Kerry of Killarney and Tralee on an opportunistic basis, which are within commuting distances of the Gateways.   <\/p><p>  With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, an FDI project secured for one Gateway can have a positive impact on other Gateways and their surrounding areas. The recent Northern Trust announcement in Limerick, which will create 400 jobs, is a case in point as this announcement will have a positive economic impact, directly and indirectly, on County Kerry. <\/p><p>  IDA Ireland has also explained that, typically, a potential investor is shown three or four locations within a Gateway Region that can meet its requirements. In selecting such locations, IDA Ireland endeavours to include locations which have been affected by closures\/job losses. However, whilst IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of a location, the final decision on where to locate is taken in all cases by the client company based on its business requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400050#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":99,"content":"<p>Question No. 37 answered with Question No. 16.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget Submissions","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400050#WRD01450"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[56530\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400050#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he was lobbied by the Industrial Development Agency and or any multinational corporations regarding Budget 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>The Enterprise Development Agencies, i.e. the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Forf&aacute;s and Science Foundation Ireland, made a joint Pre-Budget 2013 Submission to my Department.  <\/p><p>  Many IDA client companies are members of representative organisations.

IDA has been working for many years to diversify the pharmaceutical base here in Ireland.  Patents on several blockbuster drugs expired over the last decade and, notwithstanding these developments, there has been continued growth in the sector.  <\/p><p>  In growing the pharmaceutical sector, IDA's strategy has been to win leading company investment and to diversify the breadth of operations over multiproduct sites, including associated services and development of new compounds.  We have been enormously successful in attracting eight of the top 10 global pharmaceutical companies and the world&rsquo;s number one biotechnology company to Ireland. In addition, there are a large number of companies outside of the top ten who manufacture and successfully export from Ireland.<\/p><p>  The Irish pharmaceutical industry is an enormously important and highly valued sector in Ireland. While the industry has been faced with some difficult years due to patent expiration and competitiveness challenges, the industry is starting to see an increase in R&amp;D productivity with the advent of more targeted biotech therapies and personalised medicines.  2012 saw the highest number of new drugs, 39, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 16 years and the predictions are that the industry has turned a corner.  Ireland is in position to be the location of choice for development and manufacture of a number of these next generation drugs and the sector has been performing well in Ireland, with &euro;1.1bn of new investment announced in 2012 from five major IDA client companies, which will result in 1,200 jobs.  <\/p><p>  While IDA Ireland will continue to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s offering in the pharmaceutical sector, the Agency has indicated that it will also continue to focus on biopharmaceuticals, which represent the next wave of opportunity in the industry. Indeed, it successfully attracted and developed globally leading programmes from companies such as Allergan, Amgen, Centocor, Eli Lilly, Genzyme, Merck, and Pfizer with the result that Ireland now has a globally leading biopharmaceutical cluster in the next generation of pharmaceutical products.<\/p><p>  Whether available as a generic or a brand, global companies strive to ensure that the products they produce are produced to the highest international standards.  Ireland retains an exemplary global record in this regard with an excellent regulator in the Irish Medicines Board and with much improved competitiveness through wage reduction and restraint which is helping Ireland to compete with lower cost locations.  <\/p><p>  Additionally, Government agencies are continuing to invest in research and training to help the academic system support industry.  IDA Ireland, through its overseas network, remains committed to maintaining and growing relationships with key decision makers in the pharmaceutical industry and IDA Ireland can offer assistance to companies to support new investment and enhancement of technical capability.<\/p><p>  The overall export performance of the sector, therefore, is multifactorial and whilst there are challenges with regard to patent expiration, IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to support continuous improvement and transformation in its existing client base while seeking to win new FDI opportunities in the pharmaceutical sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400051#WRE00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Mentoring Strategy","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400051#WRE00650"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[3184\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400051#WRE00700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on whether a national mentoring strategy has benefits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":113,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[3183\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400051#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his plans to develop a national mentoring strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":114,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 46 together.<\/p><p>  I would like to acknowledge the importance of mentoring as a means of supporting start-up businesses and of sustaining and growing existing businesses.

As of April 2012, net-outward migration for the working age population was 34,000, made up of an outflow of 87,000 and an inflow of 53,000. Not surprisingly, these flows were largely accounted for by the under-35 category (68,000 and 30,000 for emigration and immigration respectively).  Net outward migration (emigration less immigration) for Irish nationals in the year to April 2012 was 26,000.

These include:<\/p><p> - reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms; <\/p><p> - reducing the administrative burden on business; <\/p><p> - placing downward pressure on insurance costs through the Legal Services Bill; <\/p><p> - encouraging all professionals to supply quotes in advance to business customers; <\/p><p> - providing supports to businesses to improve their energy and resource efficiency; <\/p><p> - introducing a mechanism to allow small companies to apply to the Circuit Court, rather that the High Court, to have an Examiner appointed; <\/p><p> - encouraging local authorities to exercise restraint in the setting of commercial rates.<\/p><p>Updates on these, and all other commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs, are detailed in the Quarterly Progress Reports on the Plan which are available on my Department&#8217;s website,   .<\/p><p><br \/>  The most recent report published by the National Competitiveness Council (NCC), in July of this year - &#8220;Ireland's Competitiveness Scorecard&#8221; - acknowledged that improvements have taken place in Ireland&#8217;s cost competitiveness, particularly in relation to labour costs and property costs. However, the NCC also advised that Ireland must maintain focus and continue to reduce costs to business.  I would point out to the Deputy that the Programme for Government includes a commitment to work for greater economic co-operation with Northern Ireland to accelerate the process of recovery and the creation of jobs on the island.  In that context, my Department and its agencies are working with their Northern Ireland counterparts on a range of issues as set out in PQ 3234\/13.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400052#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Development","counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400052#WRF00750"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[3177\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400052#WRF00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the action he is taking to facilitate the inclusion of more Irish companies in the global supply chains of multinational companies in view of his recent comments that a 5% increase in local spending by multinationals would generate &euro;500 million for the economy here in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":135,"content":"<p>In accordance with the commitment given in the 2012 Action Plan for Jobs, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have established a senior management team to drive effective collaboration on key priorities such as including more Irish companies in the global supply chains of multinational companies.

As regards the person in question, I can confirm that an application for a passport was received by the Department last August.  <font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>The child was born in Mullingar on 1 April 2009.

The Department wrote to the applicant&#8217;s parents on three occasions to inform them of this and to advise them of the requirements, which were needed to finalise the application to passport issue.

The valuation date for determining the market value of the assets is, in general, 30 June of each year and the due date for payment is 25 September.  I confirmed in my Budget 2013 Speech that the levy will not be renewed after 2014.  The moneys raised from the pension fund levy are being used to pay for the Government&#8217;s <i>Jobs Initiative <\/i>introduced<i><\/i>in May 2011.  The measures introduced as part of the <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i>  include a new 9% VAT rate on certain activities, the halving of the lower rate of PRSI and small amounts of additional current and capital expenditure.<\/p><p><br \/>  The implementation of a jobs and growth strategy is a key priority of the Government.  The measures announced in the <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i> are aimed at assisting in employment generation &#8211; providing opportunities for those who are out of work, to restore public morale and confidence in the economy and encourage spending by consumers.<\/p><p><br \/>  The chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans.  The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.  I cannot intervene in this process in respect of the pension fund referred to in the details supplied with the question or other pension funds.<\/p><p><br \/>  However, the legislation also includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that benefits payable, either currently or prospectively to any member, are adjusted in such a way that the reduction in value of those benefits shall not exceed 0.6% of the market value of the assets accounting for the scheme&#8217;s liabilities to that member.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are two exceptions to the requirement to pay the levy provided for in the governing legislation (section 125B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999).<\/p><p><br \/>  The first exception provides that the levy will not apply to the assets of occupational pension schemes in respect of employees whose employment is or was wholly exercised outside the State.  In other words the levy does not apply to the extent that a pension scheme is intended to provide retirement benefits outside the State.<\/p><p><br \/>  The second exception provides that the levy will not apply where the trustees of a scheme have passed a resolution to wind-up the scheme and where the business in respect of which the scheme was established is insolvent.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am conscious of the concerns of pension scheme members about the impact of a levy in circumstances where the pensions sector, in common with other sectors in our economy and society, is finding the current economic and financial environment very challenging.  However, much of the value of pension funds is attributable to the rolled up value of generous tax reliefs that pension savings have historically been granted and continue to receive.  The purpose of the levy is to improve the economic environment by providing the means to encourage job creation in areas of our economy most likely to deliver that employment quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400055#WRJ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400056#WRK00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":201,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400056#WRK00150"},{"type":"question","counter":202,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[3487\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400056#WRK00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide an update on plans for a new school building in respect of a school (details supplied) in County Meath; when the design stage will be completed; when he expects construction to commence; when the development will be completed; the number of students in prefabs at the school at present; the costs to his Department of these prefabs on an annual basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":203,"content":"<p>The project referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning.

For example, Enterprise Ireland has been working with its client companies to improve access to public procurement opportunities for SMEs, while my Department has worked with the business sector to progress a range of sectoral initiatives in areas such as access toi finance, manufacturing, and the green economy.<\/p><p><br \/>  In June 2012, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, launched a Local Government Sectoral Strategy to promote employment and support local enterprise<i>.  <\/i>This Strategy<i><\/i>outlines measures being taken by Local Authorities to assist enterprises in the areas of business charges, local enterprise supports, procurement, and local development and community-based initiatives.<\/p><p><br \/>  In December 2012, the Minister of State for Tourism &amp; Sport, Deputy Michael Ring, announced almost &#8364;26 million in new funding for local sports projects across the country.  This was the first round of sports capital funding in four years.  Many of the projects selected for funding under the programme will support local employment as sports facilities are improved and upgraded throughout the country.<\/p><p><br \/>  Government agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners, County Enterprise Boards, Enterprise Ireland and Local Authorities also attend local events such as job fairs and exhibitions to provide advice to attendees.<\/p><p><br \/>  Recognising the important role that local communities play in job creation, the Government will continue to support local development in 2013 through a range of initiatives such as these across various Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400058#WRM01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400059#WRN00150"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[3601\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400059#WRN00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the proposed future use of the Enterprise Ireland site on Griffith Avenue Extension, Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":264,"content":"<p>Enterprise Ireland transferred the greater part of the site in question to Dublin City University (DCU) who will develop the site into an internationally\u2010recognised &ldquo;Innovation Campus&rdquo;, involving a partnership of education and research institutions, enterprise and the semi\u2010state sector. <\/p><p>  I was pleased to officially open the DCU Innovation Campus on Monday last, 21 January 2013.

The new supports were also a first step towards aligning the CEB supports more closely with those of Enterprise Ireland and to improve the flow of clients between the CEBs and EI.  While the fundamental requirements in relation to eligibility of  projects for assistance remained focused on manufacturing and internationally traded services, a broader range of business costs became eligible for support.<\/p><p>  Since coming into office, this Government has demonstrated our determination to fundamentally address the challenge of supporting micro and small businesses. For example, we have introduced the Microenterprise loan fund and the Credit Guarantee Scheme.  We are currently in the process of reforming the national micro and small business support infrastructure by dissolving the City and County Enterprise Boards and establishing new Local Enterprise Offices that will operate from within Local Authorities, but with clear oversight by Enterprise Ireland.  To this end, a new Microenterprise Division has been established within EI and this will become the national Centre of Excellence for supporting micro and small businesses, benchmarked to international standards.<\/p><p>  This fundamental reform offers the opportunity to revisit and refocus national policy in relation to the micro and small business sector with a view to ensuring that the state supports are properly targeted at that sector and that the LEOs become a &ldquo;First Stop Shop&rdquo; for micro and small businesses for the range of supports available across the system. <\/p><p>  The LEOs will engage will all local businesses and will offer a range of soft supports to those that are locally trading with a viable business proposition, including help with applying for a Microfinance loan.  They will also be well positioned to assist in the early identification of start-ups with the best potential to move into the Enterprise Ireland portfolio. In this respect, the Service Level Agreements between Enterprise Ireland and Local Authorities, that will underpin the new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), will include appropriate policy guidelines within which LEOs will operate in delivering enterprise supports. <\/p><p>Last November, along with Minister for Small Business Mr John Perry, I launched a public consultation process to inform this transformational agenda.  The consultation was extended to 18 January given the level of interest expressed by key stakeholders. <\/p><p>  Due to the huge response to the consultation it will take some time to review and distil the submissions, which will help shape the policy and operational scope of the new LEOs.

This is not necessarily surprising and it echoes what has been happening in most developed economies.  This has also been experienced in other industrialised countries such as Germany, UK, USA, Netherlands and Korea. <\/p><p>  It is clear that, arising from greater globalisation, reduction of tariff barriers and the ease of transporting goods, the nature of industry and the location of specialisations will be changing and there will be an inevitable movement of production of lower-cost, less-specialised goods towards cheaper labour economies in Asia, for example.  This is part of a wider global pattern.  Although it is very challenging in an internationally competitive environment, there is considerable potential for the manufacturing sector in Ireland, as we are strongly placed to create opportunities and employment in many higher- value sub sectors, for example chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food, amongst others.  <\/p><p>  Despite this trend, there are now 197,000 people directly employed in manufacturing (both full-time and part-time), and a similar number of people employed indirectly.  This figure has stabilised over the last two years.  It is noteworthy that exports of manufactured goods are continuing to rise despite a difficult environment.  Even more heartening is the fact that exports by the services sector are going from strength to strength, with an 11% increase in the first nine months of 2012.  In addition, the contribution of manufacturing to GDP has risen significantly over the last decade<\/p><p>  To promote job opportunities in this sector, the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 included several specific initiatives to develop the sector.  The Manufacturing Development Forum, which I established last year, has provided valuable insights into the sector.  I also asked Fortas to develop a new Strategy for Manufacturing up to 2020 and this study is currently being finalised.  A new report on the skills needs of the sector will also be a key driver in pursing those specific needs. <\/p><p>   The services sector accounts for two thirds of total employment.  While the majority of service firms are not supported by the State, 125,644 persons are employed in agency-supported firms, an increase of 4.6% on 2010.  A total of 46,634 of these are employed by Irish companies, with growth particularly strong in areas including business services, ICT and financial services.  By concentrating on where our competitive advantages lie, in both manufacturing and services and building on last year&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs and the new Jobs plan to be announced in the near future, I am confident that growth in employment will be achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400060#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":288,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400060#WRO01050"},{"type":"question","counter":289,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[3674\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400060#WRO01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the total number of jobs through foreign direct investment created in each of the past six years to date; the extent to which emerging trends have indicated opportunities for the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":290,"content":"<p>Details of the total number of new jobs created in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s client companies for the past six years are set out in the tabular statement which follows.<\/p><p>In accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, which covers the period 2010 to 2014, IDA Ireland has identified current and future industry trends which are enhancing the agency&rsquo;s ability to secure foreign direct investment (FDI) projects, thereby creating sustainable employment opportunities in Ireland.

The agency has assured me that its global team will continue to pursue these opportunities vigorously in 2013 and to ensure the organisation achieves its goals and targets as outlined in Horizon 2020.<\/p><p><b>New Jobs Created in IDA Ireland's Client Companies 2007-2012<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th><br \/>Employment Data<\/th><th><div>2007<\/div><\/th><th><div>2008<\/div><\/th><th><div>2009<\/div><\/th><th><div>2010<\/div><\/th><th><div>2011<\/div><\/th><th><div>2012<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Total New Jobs Created<\/td><td><div>9,372<\/div><\/td><td><div>6,766<\/div><\/td><td><div>3,582<\/div><\/td><td><div>12,178<\/div><\/td><td><div>13,381<\/div><\/td><td><div>12,722<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400060#WRO01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises","counter":291,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400060#WRO01225"},{"type":"question","counter":292,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[3675\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400060#WRO01300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which research has been carried out to identify possible disincentives to job creation and retention of existing jobs in the small and medium-sized enterprises; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":293,"content":"<p>The development of appropriate policy responses to the current economic challenges is dependent on robust research and consultation with key stakeholders, which is undertaken on an ongoing basis by Government, the State agencies and other independent bodies.  In addition to work carried out by my own Department, Forf&aacute;s provides independent and rigorous research, advice and support in the areas of enterprise and science policy.  This work informs my Department and wider Government in its responses to the needs of the business environment. <\/p><p>  Last year, my Department carried out research on the need for a Microfinance Fund to support start-up and expanding microenterprises, resulting the Government approving the recently launched Microenterprise Loan Fund.  My Department also worked with independent consultants Capital for Enterprise in researching the need for, and developing, a Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme, which was launched last November.<\/p><p>  Working with Forf&aacute;s and key stakeholders, my Department is currently in the process of finalising reports on the construction and manufacturing sectors, as part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, which will highlight issues impacting on these sectors and set out recommendations to address these issues and facilitate these sectors in developing to their potential. <\/p><p>  Forfas recently published a report entitled 'A Review and Audit of Licences Across Key Sectors of the Irish Economy'.  The key recommendation from the review is for the relevant licensing authorities to proceed towards the development of integrated licensing systems for retail, food and drink, hospitality and leisure and construction sectors to rationalise the number of licences and to streamline processes and therefore reduce the overall administrative burden on business.  <\/p><p>  The National Competitiveness Council reports on key competitiveness issues facing the Irish economy and offers recommendations on policy actions required to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position.  The most recent report, while acknowledging an improvement in Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, identified a number of issues which need to be addressed in order to achieve sustainable, long-lasting competitiveness gains.  Ireland must maintain focus on implementing a range of structural reforms across all sectors of the economy including issues relating to the labour market, competition policy, taxation, education and skills.  The report also highlighted the importance of ensuring that our banking system is appropriately structured to provide an adequate supply of credit for enterprise.<\/p><p>  The Department of Finance regularly commissions and publishes independent credit-demand surveys which seek to identify and resolve issues around the availability and access to credit for small and medium sized enterprises.  Arising out of the findings of the Mazar&rsquo;s survey published in late 2011, the Minister of State with responsibility for small business, Deputy John Perry, accompanied by the Secretary General from the Department of Finance, held a series of seven regional meetings around the country to discuss access to bank credit with key local stakeholders.  These meetings gave rise to a whole series of positive actions to help small businesses to stay in business and create jobs.<\/p><p>  I regularly meet with small business owners across all sectors and hear directly from them what further measures are needed in order to incentivise them to retain and create jobs.  Also, as part of the preparation of the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 which is now nearing finalisation, more than 55 submissions were received, containing over 600 individual proposals for consideration.  Many of these submissions made suggestions on how job retention and creation could be enhanced and where appropriate, ideas that were considered to be feasible for implementation this year have been taken on board in formulating the Action Plan. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400060#WRO01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits","counter":294,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400060#WRO01450"},{"type":"question","counter":295,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[3676\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400060#WRO01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of applications for work permits received by his Department in each of the past five years to date; the numbers granted and or refused in each of the years in question; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":296,"content":"<p>Since 2004, Irish labour market policy has been to ensure that general labour and skills needs are met from within the work force of the European Economic Area (EEA).

While I acknowledge that upward only rent reviews are putting pressure on some enterprises in the commercial and retail sectors at the present time, there are other factors influencing decisions of individual companies to reduce jobs.  The retail sector has, for example, seen a disproportionate fall in activity due to the fall in consumer confidence and a reduction in discretionary spending by Irish consumers.  Allied to this, the changing nature of retailing has seen new patterns in the way people shop.  The growth of On-Line trading has impacted on the high street retailer, not just in Ireland, but in the UK also where there have been a number of high-profile retail closures in recent months.<\/p><p><br \/>  Following extensive consideration of the matter, the Government announced in December 2011 that it had decided not to proceed with legislation to abolish upward-only rent review clauses in leases signed before 28<sup>th<\/sup> February 2010.

Therefore retaining and improving the competitiveness of Irish enterprise will be central to continuing to grow exports and jobs.<\/p><p>  The entire focus of the Action Plan for Jobs is on improving competitiveness, transforming the operating environment, protecting existing jobs and supporting the creation of new ones.  An important factor affecting job retention and creation in indigenous companies in particular is their ability to access finance from both bank and non-bank sources. The Minister for Finance has set ambitious SME lending targets for the two pillar banks and has set up the Credit Review Office to ensure that viable enterprises can access finance.  I recently launched the Microenterprise Loan Fund and the Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme both of which are designed to address specific market failures.

In addition over &euro;1.9 billion will be spent on child benefit payments in respect of just under 1.17 million children.<\/p><p>  The Comprehensive Expenditure Review, 2012 to 2014, published in December, 2011, provided for a reduction of a further &euro;540 million in expenditure by my Department in 2013.  However, the Government was able to reduce the net savings required for this year to &euro;390 million, &euro;150 million less than originally indicated.  <\/p><p>  This enabled the Government to ensure, for the second year in a row, that there was no reduction in primary weekly rates of payment, including OFP.  In addition, there were no changes to entitlements under the family income supplement scheme which some OPF recipients in employment receive or the rate or duration of weekly fuel allowance which is also payable with OFP.<\/p><p>  In addition, I also secured almost &euro;30 million in spending on employment programmes, school meals, childcare places and an area based child poverty initiative, which will benefit social welfare recipients, and in particular lone parents.<\/p><p>  However, in order to achieve the level of saving required in Budget 2013, it was necessary to introduce expenditure reduction measures including some reductions in child benefit. <\/p><p>  OFP plays an important role in providing income support to lone parents.  Changes have been made to the payment since its introduction in 1991, reflecting the changes taking place in society, the labour market and the expectations and realities of parents&rsquo; lives, and particularly of mothers, in terms of work and care.  <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012 reduced the amount of earnings disregarded for the purposes of the OFP means test from &euro;146.50 per week in 2011 to &euro;130 per week in 2012, to &euro;110 per week in 2013, to &euro;90 per week in 2014, to &euro;75 per week in 2015, and to &euro;60 per week in 2016, for new and existing claimants.<\/p><p>  The OFP earnings disregard has been a central component of the employment support policy for lone parents who are in receipt of the OFP.  Its objective is to contribute to the costs of taking up employment including childcare.  Evidence suggests, however, that while the earnings disregard has played a role in facilitating lone parents to enter the workforce, it may also have had the effect of trapping lone parents in low-paid part-time employment in order to keep their earnings below the disregard.<\/p><p>  The OFP earnings disregard was reduced to &euro;110 per week from 1 January 2013.  Earnings of less than &euro;110 per week are excluded from the assessment of means with claimants entitled to the full rate of payment.  Earnings above this limit are assessed at 50% up to a maximum of &euro;425 per week with a reduced rate of OFP payable.<\/p><p>  The upper earnings limit of &euro;425 upholds the employment support objectives of the scheme by ensuring that the OFP payment is targeted at disadvantaged and low-income low parents to assist them in covering their employment-related expenses, including child care, and to enable them to more easily assess the implications of taking up education, training, and\/or employment as an alternative to long-term social welfare income support dependency.<\/p><p>  Finally, the abolition of the PRSI allowance does not affect lone parents who are on a low income as employees with weekly earnings of less than &euro;352 are not affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400063#WRR00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":357,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400063#WRR00950"},{"type":"question","counter":358,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[3610\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400063#WRR01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when an apeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath in respect of a claim for invalidity pension will be determined by the Social Welfare Appeals Office, as same was submitted in July 2012; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":359,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 16th January 2013, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400063#WRR01100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tobacco Industry Lobbying","counter":360,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400063#WRR01113"},{"type":"question","counter":361,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[3626\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400063#WRR01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she or her officials met any representatives of the tobacco industry in the last six months; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":362,"content":"<p>There have been no meetings with the tobacco industry in the last six months.

This was in keeping with the recommendations of Justice Quirke following his report on the Peatlands Forum.  It was also in line with the motion agreed unanimously by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 7 March 2012, which called on the Government to &#8220;engage actively with the European Commission to seek a resolution within the terms of the Habitats Directive, and to prepare and submit a National Raised Bog Restoration Plan to the Commission as a matter of urgency&quot;.  My Department has prepared an outline document detailing the proposed approach to the development of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan.  The document is available on my Department&#8217;s website at .<\/p><p><br \/>  The proposals made at the Peatlands Forum identified relocation as a viable proposition for the majority of our raised bog SACs.  The primary focus of the national plan, therefore, is to develop a long-term conservation approach to each of the sites, with relocation options for those who wish to continue turf-cutting.  Financial compensation is also available to affected turf-cutters as an alternative to relocation.  Arrangements are now being made for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs and these have been finalised, or are close to finalisation, for a number of sites.  15 of the 53 sites will not require relocation arrangements to be made - for example, where little or no turf-cutting has occurred for many years.  Potential relocation options have been identified for a further 31 SACs, including the SAC referred to in the Deputy&#8217;s Question.  Work is ongoing to investigate the suitability of these relocation sites.  If, following an in-depth examination, there are a small number of SACs where there are genuinely no alternatives in terms of relocation, the national plan may be able to provide some flexibility in this regard.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am determined that, in collaboration with the Peatlands Council and local turf-cutting communities, substantial progress will be made on the national plan over the coming months.  My Department has stepped up contact with turf-cutting groups to seek long-term resolutions to the issues for their particular bogs, in compliance with EU and national law.  In addition, my Department has recently sought tenders for carrying out the necessary scientific research, which is essential to underpin the long-term conservation and restoration of these SACs and which will be required for completion of the national plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400064#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme","counter":388,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400064#WRS01350"},{"type":"question","counter":389,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[3488\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400064#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the position regarding applications (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":390,"content":"<p>The qualifying criteria for the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, administered by my Department, are that:<\/p><p>- The claimant must have a legal interest in one of the 53 raised bog special areas of conservation &ndash; ownership or turbary right;<\/p><p>- The claimant must have been the owner or entitled to exercise turbary rights on the land in question on 25 May 2010;<\/p><p>- The turbary on the site must not be exhausted;<\/p><p>- The claimant must have been cutting turf on the land in question during the relevant five year period; and<\/p><p>- No turf cutting or associated activity is ongoing on the property.<\/p><p>  Applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme have been received by my Department from both of the individuals referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question.

Following detailed research and consultation, the Panel submitted its report to me at the end of June 2012 which I subsequently published in July 2012. The report, which contains twenty four inter-related recommendations, set out a framework to provide solutions for affected homeowners.   <\/p><p>  In its report, the Panel was unambiguous in its conclusion that the State was not responsible for the pyrite problem and should not bear the cost of remediation. However, it was equally clear that the State had a pivotal role to assist and co-ordinate the provision of the necessary infrastructure to provide for the remediation of pyrite damaged dwellings where no other option is available to homeowners. It was the Panel&rsquo;s view that the stakeholders with direct or indirect responsibility for the pyrite problem should face up to their legal and moral responsibilities and provide solutions for homeowners, including funding the cost of remediation.<\/p><p>  Reflecting on the approach recommended in the report for the engagement of stakeholders in processes to provide a solution to the pyrite problem, my Department and I have been involved in on-going discussions with key stakeholders and in particular with representatives from the Construction Industry Federation, Irish Concrete Federation, HomeBond, and the Irish Banking Federation since July 2012. My objective in engaging in this process, which has taken longer than I anticipated, was to achieve collective agreement for the provision of structures to deliver solutions for homeowners in line with the recommendations in the pyrite report.   <\/p><p>  The Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation and HomeBond have agreed to establish an entity for the purposes of operating the remediation scheme in respect of those homes affected by pyrite and where the homeowner has no other form of redress. A number of financial institutions have agreed in principle to make initial loan funding available to facilitate the early commencement of pyrite remediation work and it is intended that the entity will engage with those institutions in relation to this loan facility.<\/p><p>  I have recently received Government approval for the imposition of a levy on both the quarrying and insurance sectors, as recommended by the independent Pyrite Panel, in order to provide the funding necessary for the remediation of pyrite damaged dwellings. The imposition of the levies will require primary legislation and I am committed to having the legislation published and enacted in the shortest timeframe possible.   <\/p><p>  The Government also approved the establishment of a Pyrite Resolution Board which will have oversight of the operation of the remediation scheme and ensure that the public interest, and the particular interest of the affected homeowners, is well served. <\/p><p>  I am currently finalising the membership of the Pyrite Resolution Board. I have appointed a Chairman who, with me, is keen for the Board to commence its work as soon as possible. While, I am not in a position at this stage to indicate when the remediation work will begin, there will be no undue delay on my part or that of my Department in putting the necessary structures in place for a remediation scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400066#WRU01000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Areas of Conservation","counter":433,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400066#WRU01050"},{"type":"question","counter":434,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[3604\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400066#WRU01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the way the recent designation of the area from Rockabill to the Dalkey Island reefs as a special area of conservation will affect the greater Dublin drainage project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1013","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":435,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[3605\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400066#WRU01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the extent to which the greater Dublin drainage project relied on the non-designation of proposed outfall areas as special areas of conservation; the extent to which this project will be reconsidered following this designation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1013","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[3606\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400066#WRU01300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views that the special area of conservation from Rockabill to the Dalkey Island reefs will be threatened by the proposed greater Dublin drainage project; the damage that will be caused to marine life in the area by the construction of outfall pipes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1013","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":437,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 to 154, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  Planning for the Greater Dublin Regional Drainage Project &ndash; North Dublin Treatment Plant and Orbital Sewer is being progressed by Fingal County Council. <\/p><p>  Under the Alternative Sites Assessment and Route Selection Report (Phase 2) for the scheme, three possible treatment sites and two possible outfall locations have been identified by the Council as emerging preferred options and a non-statutory public consultation process was carried out during 2012.

The Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with communities to enhance community safety in a wide range of local fora, including the Joint Policing Committees, and through programmes such as Community Alert which operates in cooperation with the programme partners, Muintir na T&iacute;re, and has led to the establishment of 1,345 Community Alert groups countrywide.<\/p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Older People Strategy reiterates An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s overriding objective, set out in the Strategy Statement 2010-2012, which is to prevent, detect and disrupt crime and criminal activity and to ensure that people feel safe in their homes, on our roads and in public places, specifically as it refers to older people.<\/p><p>  During 2012, the national Garda Supporting Safer Community Campaigns have continued to highlight key issues, in particular Crime Prevention. The first campaign took place in May and the second campaign, which took place in September, focused primarily on Burglary, Road Safety and Supporting Victims of Crime.<\/p><p>  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are developing further strategies in relation to the prevention and reduction of burglaries and metal theft.<\/p><p>  It is the Government's intention to ensure that frontline services are maintained at the highest level possible through the most efficient use of resources.  The Commissioner enjoys my full support and that of the Government in continuing to confront crime in all its forms.  I have every confidence that he and everyone in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to deliver an effective police service in rural as in all other areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400067#WRV01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Investigations","counter":460,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400067#WRV01550"},{"type":"question","counter":461,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[3511\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400067#WRV01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the current and expected position in regard to the investigation into the incident reported by a person (details supplied) in County Kildare arising from a fire on their property on the 9 April 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":462,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the incident referred to was fully investigated and an investigation file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) who directed no prosecution.

In all such cases, before a final decision is made, consideration must be given to the eleven separate headings set out in Section 3 (6) of the 1999 Act, the provisions of Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement and other relevant legal and constitutional provisions. Such decision-making is also guided by, among other things, international law and Supreme and High Court Judgments. This process is followed equally in asylum related cases and in the cases of illegal immigrants.  The ultimate decision will be to make a Deportation Order or to grant Leave to Remain in the State for a specified period and subject to stated conditions.<\/p><p><br \/>  Before any non-EEA national can 'apply for Leave to Remain', they must be served with a notification of intention to deport, as provided for under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). However, it must be borne in mind that many of the potential 'leave to remain' cases, although having been served with such a notification, will have their cases finalised<b><\/b>  through the granting of Subsidiary Protection or the granting of permission to remain under different headings, such as under EU Treaty Rights or family reunification provisions or indeed through marriage to an Irish national. Additionally, some of the persons awaiting a 'leave to remain' decision will, for their own valid reasons, opt for voluntary repatriation, formally and informally, before a final decision is taken in their cases. The Deputy will appreciate that many other cases cannot be finalised owing to the existence of judicial review proceedings.<\/p><p><br \/>  Precise figures for each of the above categories, and for the numbers of cases which are currently awaiting a 'leave to remain' decision, are not be available without engaging in a very detailed and time-consuming exercise.  This would not be justified as it would have the effect of diverting case processing personnel from this area.  As the Deputy will appreciate the actual processing of cases must continue to be afforded the highest priority.<\/p><p><br \/>  I can also advise the Deputy that I recently approved an initiative to put in place a panel with legal expertise who will assist the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in processing a cohort of repatriation cases, thus speeding up the overall process and reducing the time spent by persons in the Direct Provision system. I would expect to see significant dividends, in terms of cases finalised, from this initiative in the coming months.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy should note that the processing of cases at the repatriation stage is a complex one with obligations to adhere to both domestic and international laws and jurisprudence, and to make decisions in accordance with the UN Convention on Human Rights. However, I am anxious that all cases are processed as promptly as possible and, to this end, apart from the legal panel initiative referred to earlier, additional staff members have also been deployed to this area of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) in recent years. Moreover, substantial investment has been made in the development of technology required to support the processing of such cases.<\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of the time taken to finalise cases of this nature, no two cases will be the same in terms of their nature or complexity. Equally, cases will vary, depending, for example, on the countries of origin and the nature of family groups involved. The reality is that each case will have its own complexities which must be analysed in great detail, under a variety of headings as indicated at the outset, before a final decision can be made.<\/p><p><br \/>  Depending on the nature of the case, in some instances, a decision may be reached in a matter of months, whereas in others where for example there may be multiple legal challenges at various stages of the process it may not be possible to reach a final decision for a number of years.<\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore, the current multi-layered approach to the processing of cases of asylum origin is not resource efficient and that is why I am providing for a single-procedure based approach in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I plan to progress in 2013. This proposed single-procedure will require asylum applicants to advance, at the outset, all reasons, protection or otherwise, behind their request to remain in the State. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400068#WRW00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residential Institutions","counter":468,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400068#WRW00450"},{"type":"question","counter":469,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[3535\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400068#WRW00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide an update in relation to his consideration of issues relating to the Bethany House and the redress issues surrounding that home.","asker":"1011","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":470,"content":"<p>While I cannot be more specific at this time, consideration continues to be given to issues relating to the former Bethany Home and how they might be addressed.

Its objective is to improve the productivity and profitability of participants&rsquo; beef enterprises by focusing on five areas: financial management, grassland management, herd health, animal breeding\/welfare and producing animals to market specifications. Under the BTAP, participants engage in peer-to-peer learning by joining discussion groups which are facilitated by professional agricultural advisors drawn from Teagasc and the private sector. <\/p><p>  Payments to producers in 2012, which were limited to a maximum of &euro;1,000 per participant and subject to EU state aid rules, were contingent on compliance with Programme requirements, i.e. attendance at a prescribed number of discussion group meetings or approved national events plus completion of two technology adoption tasks from a menu of eight designed to enhance on-farm efficiency. The broad range of available task options allowed participants to choose those best suited to the business needs and particular characteristics of their beef enterprises.<\/p><p>  I understand that the individual concerned did not obtain a payment because he failed to satisfactorily complete one of two selected tasks which related to the completion of a herd health plan in consultation with a veterinary surgeon. Participants who chose that task were required to join the voluntary Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) eradication programme, a condition of which was that herd owners had to submit tissue samples from all calves born on their holdings in 2012 to one of a number of designated laboratories. Task completion was verified by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) which maintains a database of laboratory results on behalf of Animal Health Ireland. <\/p><p>  The rationale for this approach is that the BTAP thus recognised and rewarded producers who tested their herds during the initial voluntary phase of a national programme to eradicate a highly contagious and costly cattle disease. Information received from ICBF indicated that the herd owner in question did not sample any animals born in 2012. Given that it is now mandatory for herd owners to take a tissue tag sample from all calves born after 1 January 2013, a producer should not entertain a legitimate expectation of receiving a BTAP payment for complying with a statutory requirement. <\/p><p>  It is the responsibility of participants and their facilitators to familiarise themselves with the Programme Terms and Conditions and with the consequences for breaches of the rules. In applying for the BTAP, farmers undertook to comply with the Terms and Conditions of the Programme and accepted that failure to abide by the rules could result in a loss of payment. It was determined following appeal that the individual concerned failed to fully comply with the BTAP Terms and Conditions and, accordingly, no Programme payment was possible in this case. However, subject to satisfying eligibility criteria, the producer concerned is free to participate in year two of the Programme, the opening of which I announced last week. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400070#WRY01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":532,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400071#WRZ00125"},{"type":"question","counter":533,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[3613\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400071#WRZ00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he or his officials met any representatives of the tobacco industry in the last six months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":534,"content":"<p>Neither I nor any of my officials have met any representatives of the tobacco industry in the last six months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400071#WRZ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Appeals","counter":535,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400071#WRZ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":536,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[3635\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400071#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a decision on an appeal for disadvantaged area aid payment will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Mayo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":537,"content":"<p>The appeal of the person named was recently forwarded to the DAS Appeals Committee for consideration; immediately that Committee has adjudicated on the appeal, the person concerned will be notified of its decision, in writing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400071#WRZ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Environment Protection Scheme Payments","counter":538,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400071#WRZ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":539,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[3701\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012400071#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payment of REP scheme for 2012 will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick.","asker":"1056","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":540,"content":"<p>The person mentioned commenced REPS 4 in June 2008 and received payments for the first four years of their contract.

In particular, recent European policy developments suggest that youth work has the potential to do more and has a special relevance for those young people who are marginalised from traditional systems of education, employment and training. <\/p><p><br \/>  Youth Work (in its many manifestations &#8211; recreational, sporting, learning, volunteering) engages young people over a relatively long developmental period from ages 10 to 24 and beyond. It works for young people at their own pace.  I see quality youth work as a commitment to continually ensuring and enhancing the optimum youth work provision and practice for youth people so that young people derive maximum benefit from their participation in youth work.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland&#8217;s Youth Presidency Programme is seeking to maximise the potential of youth policy in addressing the goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy and aims to highlight how youth policy, as expressed through quality youth work and youth activities, can do more to enhance a range of life skills including employability.<\/p><p>This priority theme will be advanced through the EU Youth Working Party&#8217;s work programme.

This plan began with elimination of on-call in East Cork and is currently moving across other regions in Cork.  <i>On-call<\/i>   rostering means the crew is not on active duty, but is summoned in the event of a call-out. Average time for vehicle activation from call-out is over 20 minutes.  On-call is not an efficient or effective use of emergency resources and it significantly affects operational capacity, adherence to the Organisation of Working Time Act and health and safety for staff.  A risk assessment for on-call has been carried out and is to be included on the NAS Risk Register. Discussions are also pending with the Health and Safety Authority on its concerns over the use of on-call. <\/p><p><br \/>  The change to on-duty means highly trained paramedic crews will be on site in their stations or their vehicles to respond to dispatches immediately. The changes mean that resources can be deployed dynamically, based on need and demand patterns, rather than simply by station location. This allows for more flexibility and responsiveness and will produce better response times for the people in Cork and Kerry and a better service.  In the new model of service, on duty ambulances and response vehicles will move to the optimal location at any time, based on predicted needs assessments.<\/p><p><br \/>  The HSE has stated that it recognises the remote, rural location of West Cork and the proposed changes will be designed to suit the needs of this population.
