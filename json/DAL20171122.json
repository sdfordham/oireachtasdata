The Deputy is aware that following the completion of the mid-term review of the capital plan, my Department secured the largest increase in capital funding of all Departments out to 2021 and the end of the current capital plan.<\/p>  <p>  Total capital funding over the next four years will now be &euro;7 billion for transport, &euro;200 million for sport and &euro;169 million for tourism, and those funding levels represent an increase of &euro;1.2 billion, or 20%.  This allows for a significant acceleration of previous plans and makes a great number of projects possible across the country.<\/p>  <p>  In public transport, the priorities are to address congestion and the emerging capacity constraints in our public transport system across our cities.  The additional funding secured will allow for the roll-out of projects such as BusConnects, which will overhaul and improve our bus infrastructure; the city centre rail re-signalling project, which will improve speeds on mainline rail in the greater Dublin area; a new central traffic control centre for the national rail network; infrastructure maintenance across the national rail network; additional Luas capacity with additional trams and longer trams on the Luas network; and continued planning and design for the new metro north.<\/p>  <p>  Our roads development programme will see a total of &euro;2.4 billion invested over the next four years.  The bulk of the expenditure in the programme will be directed towards road maintenance and renewal and meeting contractual commitments under the road public private partnership programme.  As regards regional and local roads, there will be a significant number of additional road upgrade schemes aimed at addressing safety, employment generation and support and urban regeneration to be advanced.<\/p>  <p>  The improved funding levels will also allow for greater investment in cycling and walking routes in our main cities.  The threefold increase in funding I secured will allow for planning and design work with commencement of an intensive construction programme in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of climate change, I am setting aside &euro;35 million over the next four years to back new ideas that will help decarbonise the transport sector, including pilot initiatives for low emission technologies.  As part of a package of measures and incentives to accelerate the take-up of electric vehicles, I have secured funding for the National Transport Authority to allow it to introduce an electric vehicle taxi grant<\/p>  <p>  In the area of tourism, I was pleased to announce a &euro;30 million increase in funding available to support greenways development, while an additional &euro;2 million is being allocated to promote digital investment in tourism marketing, which is important in the context of Brexit and the decline in visitors from Britain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200003#A00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1511346600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The NDIS includes a number of transport-related actions, for which my Department, the National Transport Authority, NTA, and-or passenger transport operators have lead responsibility for implementing.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy on and overall funding of public transport.  The four-year capital envelope for public transport announced in budget 2018 includes a multi-annual allocation of almost &euro;28 million for the accessibility retrofit programme for the period 2018 to 2021.  This funding is a trebling of the previous allocation for accessibility under the capital plan.  It relates to accessibility upgrades for existing older infrastructure and is additional to the investment in new infrastructure which, as a matter of course, is now designed to facilitate accessibility.  The additional funding will facilitate the continued roll-out of the programmes to install accessible bus stops, upgrade train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users and provide grant support for the introduction of more wheelchair accessible vehicles into the taxi fleet.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA, which has functional responsibility for promoting the development of an integrated accessible public transport network, and passenger transport operators are working to progress the transport actions under the NDIS.  These actions are aimed at addressing the issues that the Deputy has raised.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Rail hopes to commence a pilot project on the DART early in the new year aimed at reducing the period of advance notice for disabled passengers from 24 to four hours by guaranteeing staffing across grouped stations and ensuring flexibility to enable staff to move between stations to provide assistance.

The NTA is undertaking this by way of three separate competitions: Dublin metropolitan, Dublin commuter and Waterford.  It is well recognised that good public transport is a key enabler of both social inclusion and economic progress, and the progression of these competitions forms part of the Government's commitment to improving our public transport system and services.  One of the objectives of the public procurement process is to bring about improvements and enhancements in how bus services are provided.  The NTA has made it clear that it expects improved punctuality and reliability in particular as well as improvements in the customer service.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA monitors all PSO services in Ireland and penalises operators if services fall below the contractual targets.  This same approach will be taken with successful bidders in all three competitions.  There are also incentives in the contract for beating punctuality targets.  As quality of service is measurable, the NTA has set out in the contract the customer service levels expected, and the NTA will use the contract terms to drive up levels of customer service.  All services operated under the new contracts will continue to be regulated by the NTA, as they are today.  This means that Leap cards, the free travel pass, real-time information, the national journey planner etc. will all continue to operate on these services.  The NTA has the statutory powers to determine fare levels, and will continue using its fares determination process to rationalise and improve the fare structure across all the different operators in the regulated bus market, including any new operators.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money.  PSO subvention increased last year, again this year, and will increase yet further next year.  Over the three years, PSO subvention will have increased by 35% in total.

That is not related to this particular issue.  The point of competition in the market is for the benefit of customers and for the service to improve.  The NTA will also regulate whoever wins the tender.  This is to give more choice, to give a better service and to keep fares down.

The reality is that the conditions and rosters under which workers have been forced to live are driving down their lives and working conditions so badly that many of the workers are leaving.

I am sure that the Deputy is aware that the transport strategy for Galway city was prepared by the National Transport Authority in partnership with Galway City Council and Galway County Council in 2016.  The strategy set out an overall framework for the development of transport infrastructure and services in Galway city and its environs over a 20 year period.  It was included in the new city development plan which was adopted by the city council and came into force in January 2017.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the issue of light rail was considered in the preparation of the transport strategy for Galway city, where it was concluded that there is insufficient demand to justify the significant additional cost of developing a light rail system and that bus-based public transport represents the most appropriate system for Galway over the period considered in this transport strategy.  Accordingly, light rail was not taken forward for economic appraisal in the context of a cost-benefit analysis for this mode of transport.  The transport strategy for Galway city also concluded that a high-quality bus-based public transport service will cater for the forecasted passenger demand and will provide significant flexibility in terms of network options and the ability to integrate with other modes.  The implementation of this strategy is primarily a matter for the local authority to pursue.<\/p>  <p>  The national planning framework is being developed at present under the leadership of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.<\/p><p>The framework is a long-term strategic planning framework which will guide national, regional and local planning and investment decisions over the period to 2040.  In the context of the draft national planning framework and key future growth enablers for Galway, the plan recognises the need for provision of a citywide public transport network with enhanced accessibility between existing and proposed residential areas and the city centre and third level institutions and the employment areas to the east of the city. The current transport strategy for Galway city and background supporting analysis aligns to this need with its successors being guided by the national planning framework.  I am conscious, in light in particular of the representations made to me not only by Deputy Connolly but other Deputies from Galway, that Galway is a microcosm of what is happening in other areas and that it is suffering in the area of traffic.  I intend to regard it is a priority and to ensure that, as implied by the Deputy, it is not omitted from any of the schemes we are introducing to improve traffic and public transport nationwide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200006#D01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511349000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for clarifying that the reason there is no light rail in Galway is, officially, insufficient demand and that no economic or cost appraisal has ever been carried out in this regard.

In the words of Conor Faughnan, AA Ireland's director of consumer affairs, traffic congestion problems in a modestly sized city like Galway are embarrassingly bad.  He has also spoken of the provision of light rail being an important part of the solution.  Some 176 cities throughout Europe have embraced light rail or tram services.  I ask the Minister to go back to his imagination and determination and to comment on the provision of a light rail service as the most sustainable solution to traffic congestion in Galway, while allowing us to comply with our commitments under climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200007#E00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1511349000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I take the Deputy's point about imagination and ambition.

The decision was made that there was not a good business case for light rail at the time.  There is definitely an attempt to address the issues of Galway and to do so in the context of the national planning framework.  The framework sets out the key future growth enablers for Galway in the area of public transport as follows: progressing the sustainable development of new greenfield areas for housing; development of supports for public transport and infrastructure; improving access and sustainable transport links through integration with existing employment areas to the east of Galway city and provision of citywide public transport network with enhanced accessibility between the existing and proposed residential areas and the city centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200007#E00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1511349000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>The Minister started well but then reverted to his script.

However, in our disappointment, we should not lose sight of the fact that the technical report found that Ireland would be an excellent host country for a Rugby World Cup.

The NDIS contains precise and measurable actions and timescales for delivery, including in the areas of transport and sport.<\/p>  <p>  Monitoring of the implementation of the strategy is being overseen by the national disability inclusion strategy steering group which comprises key Departments, the National Disability Authority and the disability stakeholders group.  My Department is represented on this body and works with relevant State agencies and public transport operators to progress the implementation of specific transport and sport actions under the strategy.  My Department and its agencies also work closely with the other Departments and agencies to deliver on cross-sectoral or cross-departmental actions.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has in place an accessibility consultative committee, ACC.  Its role is to monitor and review progress on the implementation of actions under the NDIS.  Membership of the ACC is drawn from organisations representing people with disabilities, members of the disability stakeholders group, key agencies under the aegis of the Department, as well other relevant State agencies.  Meetings of the ACC are scheduled to take place at least two weeks in advance of meetings of the steering group. The most recent meeting took place on 18 October.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department and its agencies are committed to engaging actively with the strategy, including the continued development of accessible public transport in recognition of the importance of such services to the lives of people with disabilities.  In this regard I should mention that the four-year capital envelope for public transport announced in budget 2018 includes a multi-annual allocation of almost &euro;28 million for the accessibility retro-fit programme for the period 2018 to 2021.  This funding is a trebling of the previous allocation.  It relates to accessibility upgrades for existing older infrastructure and is additional to the investment in new infrastructure which, as a matter of course, is nowadays designed to facilitate accessibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200010#H00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1511350800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I hope this plan will go ahead and that it is not another pie in the sky dream of the kind the Minister's Government often comes up with.

The Deputy is aware that Rosslare Europort is unique among State-owned ports as it is not a commercial company operating under the Harbours Acts but, rather, is operated as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Technically the port forms part of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company which is a 19th century joint venture company currently comprising Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on the Irish side and Stena Line on the Fishguard side in Wales. Each partner is wholly responsible for its own area of operations and liable for financial liabilities and profits associated with its part of the company but the overarching company structure still exists.<\/p>  <p>  The status of the port and whether that potentially inhibits its development was most recently considered in a strategic review commissioned by my Department and carried out by Indecon economic consultants.  The report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority would be extremely difficult because of the port's complex legal structure.  Instead, it was recommended that the port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated.<\/p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's engaged consultants to assess market interest in order to assist in its consideration of how best to move the matter forward.

It must be unique for a rail operator to control a port.  In terms of the port management, some &euro;2.34 million profit was made by Rosslare Europort in 2015 but that was funnelled out of the port and into Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to subsidise other aspects of the company.

The T&aacute;naiste also published the email of May 2015.  That email is damning.  The T&aacute;naiste was notified by email in May 2015 of this adversarial legal strategy.  That email should have rung alarm bells for the T&aacute;naiste.  She would have been aware of the allegations against Maurice McCabe referred to in the email and that the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, had directed that no action be taken, and that the independent review mechanism, which she established and to which this was referred, also decided that no further action be taken.  She also had met Maurice and Lorraine McCabe in October 2014 where they detailed this allegation to her and the trauma it caused them.  The T&aacute;naiste was told, however, that this very case, of which she was well aware and which had no foundation, was going to be raised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before the O'Higgins commission to undermine this man's credibility and integrity.<\/p>  <p>  The O'Higgins commission was established to verify allegations in a dossier re Garda malpractice.  It was never established to undermine a man's integrity, credibility or character.  Furthermore, the T&aacute;naiste had legal representation at the O'Higgins commission, which surely would have kept the Department and Minister informed of what was going on at the commission.  It is simply not credible that the T&aacute;naiste would forget about this email and its content, given the enormity of the McCabe issue up to then.  Indeed the T&aacute;naiste would have been appointed Minister for Justice and Equality because of this entire saga.  It is interesting that when the adversarial nature of the O'Higgins commission became public knowledge the T&aacute;naiste said to me, in answering questions in the House on 17 May, the hearings were not adversarial; they were inquisitorial.  She was flatly denying its adversarial nature.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste says she forgot the content of the email but it is far worse that she did not follow up on the email.  By passively acquiescing she became a bystander to a legal strategy designed to undermine a man's motivation, credibility and ultimately his integrity.  This has echoes of the Tusla file revelations, an episode that nearly brought down the Government at the time.  The T&aacute;naiste stayed silent on that occasion.  There was no reference to this particular email.  The Taoiseach inadvertently acknowledged &ndash; misled - the House last week because of the T&aacute;naiste's actions.  The email came to her attention last Thursday.  It was kept quiet for four days.  God only knows whether, had \"Prime Time\" not asked the questions, we ever would have known about this email.  Would it ever have been sent to Mr. Justice Charleton if that did not happen?<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach accept that the T&aacute;naiste failed Sergeant McCabe by not acting on this email and that by doing nothing, she allowed An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to seek to undermine his credibility as a person to whom she said she would offer the highest legal protection?  She may not have thrown him to the wolves but she allowed them free reign and that is a fundamental failure to protect a man who, as the Taoiseach said yesterday, was wronged on several occasions by this State and again in this context.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200012#K01200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1511352000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>All I can do at this stage is restate and remind the House of what I said previously, first, that the T&aacute;naiste had no hand, act or part in the legal strategy pursued by the former Garda Commissioner.  There is an attempt in some way to suggest in this House and other places that the State or State entities were acting in collusion or all acting together.  That is not the case.  The Garda has its own legal team and advice, as the Commissioner at the time did, and the Department has its legal team and advice.  They are separate legal entities and particularly in the context of a tribunal or commission, they have to act separately and cannot interfere in one another's legal position.  The T&aacute;naiste, and we know this from the email of 15 May 2015, did not have any knowledge that such a legal strategy was being pursued until that email was sent on 15 May.  That is after opening statements, after the fact, after the hearings were already under way.<\/p><p> The question Deputy Martin may ask is why the T&aacute;naiste did not intervene, why she did not contact the Garda Commissioner or the Garda or do so through officials.  The reason this was not done is in the email.  The answer is given to Deputy Martin in the last paragraph of that email of 15 May: the Attorney General and the Minister were advised by officials that they had no function in this.  As Deputy Martin knows, under the rules of a commission of investigation, it is an offence to release evidence from a commission and to try to interfere in the work of a commission or tribunal of inquiry.<\/p> <p> I spoke to Sergeant McCabe last night.  It was a relatively brief conversation.  We spoke for perhaps 15 or 20 minutes.  I felt, out of a courtesy to him, given that once again, through no fault of his own, he was at the centre of a major controversy, that he had a right to know what was in the email, at least before it was handed out in this House.  I read the email out to him.  He disputes its contents.  He says these criminal allegations concerning sex abuse were not raised that day and not raised at all at the O'Higgins commission.  He says the transcripts of the O'Higgins commission will show this.  This leaves us all a little confused because we do not even know if the contents of the email were accurate.  It was an email reporting a conversation between an official in the Department of Justice and Equality and the Attorney General's office.  What was written in the email and sent to the T&aacute;naiste was second-party or even third-party information.  As Deputy Martin will know, Sergeant McCabe disputes that the issue that arose in the IRM, the criminal allegations, were ever raised at the O'Higgins commission.<\/p> <p> Why did the T&aacute;naiste not act?  She did not act for the reasons I have given the Deputy.  However, she did act in other ways: she established the Policing Authority, one of the most major reforms to have occurred in Irish policing in recent years; she asked the Policing Authority to take an interest in bringing about new procedures and guidelines as to how whistleblowers could be listened to and protected within the Garda; she brought in Transparency International, the leading organisation dealing with corruption and the protection of whistleblowers; and she did what a Minister should do, that is, not to interfere in a commission or try to influence someone else's legal strategy, but to try to change things and put the right procedures and new practices in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200012#K01300","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511352600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I am taking cognisance of the fact that both Deputies exceeded their allocated time by 40 seconds.

There are all the public protestations from the Garda Commissioner and the Minister that they will offer the highest level of legal protection to this man, and here the Minister is being told that far from offering the highest legal protection, the individuals involved are going to go for him and undermine him via a case which we know the DPP is not pursuing - which no one is pursuing - and in respect of which the DPP said there was no case to answer.

There are now serious questions over the judgment, competence and credibility of An T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and I think her strategy has been precisely to protect her and her Government in this saga.<\/p>  <p>  The email, which the T&aacute;naiste claims she forgets reading, plainly sets out a deliberate and cynical strategy on the part of the former Garda Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, to undermine and attack the credibility of Maurice McCabe.  It is also clear that the T&aacute;naiste was made aware that the Garda legal team intended using serious criminal allegations against Sergeant McCabe which they knew and, more to the point, she knew had been disproved.  We now all know that the T&aacute;naiste failed to act, despite the fact that the Garda Commissioner is immediately accountable to her as Minister for Justice and Equality.  The T&aacute;naiste parroted the line that the whistleblower would be given the highest level of protection by Government while at the same time allowing the leadership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to pursue such a malicious - not an adversarial, but a malicious - legal strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste was informed in May 2014 of the criminal complaint against McCabe.  She knew that that complaint was disproved.  How, then, when she opened and read the email a year later about the very same and disproved complaint, did she not grasp the importance of any plan to use this as material in the Commissioner's legal strategy, and how then did she forget ever having read it?  The Taoiseach's position up to this point has been that the T&aacute;naiste had no prior knowledge of the legal strategy before the fact.  I take \"before the fact\" to mean before the cross-examination of Maurice McCabe by the commission.  That cross-examination took place on 18 May 2015.<\/p><p>I understand the date on the email conveying the malicious nature of the Garda legal strategy was sent to the T&aacute;naiste on 15 May.  That is three days prior to the cross-examination.  Is that not correct?  Does this mean that Deputy Frances Fitzgerald sat back and allowed Maurice McCabe to go before the commission in full knowledge of the Commissioner's vicious strategy?  I do not think that would be a matter of forgetfulness; that would call into question the competence, judgment and honour of the second most senior member of the Taoiseach's Government.  It raises very serious questions over the T&aacute;naiste's fitness for office.  She was given the opportunity last night to clarify her position.  She chose not to do that.  We did not get the answers we need.  How did the Taoiseach come into the D&aacute;il and misrepresent the truth - the truth - that the T&aacute;naiste did have prior knowledge of the legal strategy prior to Maurice McCabe's cross-examination?  Why did the Taoiseach persist with the \"no prior knowledge\" defence?  Is that still the Taoiseach's position?  Does he have confidence in the T&aacute;naiste?

We were told homelessness numbers were low, that homelessness was normal, that the homeless were to blame for being homeless.  It was cold, calculated, to some extent co-ordinated, and deeply cynical.  The people looked and saw the defenders of the system insulting the victims of the system and they did not like what they saw.  Let us see how the Taoiseach does on the issue this week.  If homelessness is a monster, this afternoon it is growling outside the doors of 23 households at the Leeside apartment complex in Cork city.  The new owners of the apartments have issued them all with notices to quit.  The new owner, Lugus Capital, does not attempt to hide its support for social cleansing.  Its website boasts \"On acquiring buildings, we completely refurbish them to a high standard, before re-letting with a focus on attracting young professional tenants.\"  Sherry FitzGerald reckons this approach could increase rental income at Leeside apartments by &euro;300,000 a year.  Lugus Capital is the Irish manager for the Larea Fa Fund Li DAC which is ultimately owned by Bain Capital.  Bain Capital, founded by former US Republican presidency candidate, Mitt Romney, mentioned more than once in the Paradise Papers, is one of the largest vulture funds on the planet.  Residents who live in this apartment complex include many young families with kids going to local schools.  One of them has received a notice to quit for 20 December.  Another has received a notice to quit for 30 December.  One of them had a notice to quit sellotaped to their front door.  Threshold reports that up and down the country profiteering landlords are using substantial refurbishment as the excuse to get rid of tenants, hike rents and get new tenants in.<\/p>  <p>  I have three questions for the Taoiseach.  Will he ensure his Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government does not just address this loophole, but closes it in such a way that the residents of Leeside apartments and others like them are fully protected?  When will this legislation be introduced?  These families cannot afford to wait.  Will he join with me and tell the House and the residents who are here in the Public Gallery that the actions of this vulture fund are completely and utterly unacceptable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200014#M02700","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1511353200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Deputy's concern about the duration of mine and the Government's honeymoon.<\/p><p>I do not think there has been a honeymoon at all but I appreciate the Deputy's interest and concern in that regard.<\/p> <p> Homelessness is something the Government feels very deeply about and it is a matter we have prioritised.  Since 2012 or so, the funding put into services for people who are homeless has doubled or even more than doubled.  We are going to have an 18% or 20% increase in homelessness services spending next year and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will either today or tomorrow announce a major increase in the number of beds available for rough sleepers so there can be a surplus number of beds available for them.  That is particularly important over the winter.  We have also put much work into developing family hubs to ensure there are no families or children on our streets and the numbers of those in bed and breakfasts and hotels falls.  It has fallen since its peak in March.  From there we will look to moving people from family hubs to new housing, and approximately 80 or 100 individuals and their families are every day being provided with housing by the State through different mechanisms.

They are putting 23 households, including young families, out on their ear in a market where if they look for a place, it will cost &euro;1,000, &euro;1,100, &euro;1,200, &euro;1,300 or &euro;1,400, with queues of 50, 60 or 100 people going out the door and down the stairs.  There are no homes to be had for these people.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to say to his housing Minister that the loophole must be closed in such a way that the people in the Gallery and families like them around the country will not be evicted?  They should protected in the case of minor refurbishment and in general from the activities from profiteering vulture funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200015#N00400","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1511353800,"counter":180,"content":"<p>It is not a loophole, it is the law.

Is the Taoiseach, a former Minister for Health and a doctor, not mortified and embarrassed that on the show last night, Mr. Stephen Cussen from Limerick stated, \"I pray every night that God will take me\"?  He says this because he is in so much pain.  He has been waiting for three years for an outpatient appointment for a knee replacement and he is in severe pain.  Stephen is waiting for a public appointment in Croom Hospital, which has a three-year waiting list.  If a person pays for private treatment, he or she would be seen in six months.<\/p>  <p>  There are 2,700 consultants working in 47 acute hospitals across the country.  A vast amount of doctors do great work, as the Taoiseach knows, and they would do more if the facilities were there to allow them do so.  In 2008, a new consultant contract was introduced so anyone who signed up to this was limited in the amount of private work they could do.  They were offered enhanced salaries to accept that contract.  The aim of this contract was to control private practice in public hospitals and stop doctors going off-site to private hospitals.  In this contract, a consultant was to do 80% public work and 20% private work in a public hospital to ensure private work was limited.  The opposite seems to be happening in some cases and the public waiting lists are only getting longer.<\/p>  <p>  Mary, who is 75 years old, was on the programme last night and she had to sell her jewellery in order to have a cataract removed because she was blind in one eye and had ailing sight in the other.  If she did not sell her jewellery she would have been on a two-year waiting list to have the cataract removed.  Once she had the money to go for private treatment, she was seen within two months and paid &euro;1,800 to be seen in the same hospital where she would have had to wait for two years.  In the Limerick hospital where Mary was waiting, there are 1,272 people waiting for a cataract operation, with 407 people waiting more than 12 months.  It was revealed last night that consultants in Limerick had a 30% private case load, which is way over the 20% level allowed in the contracts.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, almost 24,000 private patients were seen in public hospitals in Ireland.  That means in the past two years, almost 48,000 public patients have lost out to private patients in a public hospital system.  There is something wrong with our health system if we are encouraging people to travel north to Belfast to have procedures carried out privately.  Once they come home after the treatment with a receipt in their hands, the HSE will refund them the money.  I have numerous constituents awaiting procedures, including knee, hip and cataract operations.  One constituent is going blind waiting to be seen but the HSE has only said that the patient should travel to Belfast and the money will be refunded afterwards.  Would any member of the Cabinet be happy for someone close to them having to sell their possessions in order to have a simple procedure like a cataract operation carried out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200015#N00600","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1511353800,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I saw the programme last night and it was a very interesting piece of high quality investigative journalism, examining statistics and following individual consultants in the course of their work.  I would like to say I was surprised by the outcome but there has been anecdotal evidence for a long time in the health service of a minority - perhaps not a majority - of consultants not fulfilling their contractual obligations.  They are not doing the public hours they are paid for and are seeing more private patients.  The practice is deeply offensive and it must change.<\/p>  <p>  I remember when I was Minister for Health I asked for an audit to be carried out of accident and emergency department consultants to see how many patients they saw.  This arose because of a tip-off from other department staff who were concerned that consultants were not seeing very many patients who came in the door.  They were seeing patients in review clinics and private clinics relating to legal reports.  They did not see the people coming in the door from ambulances in big numbers.  To my knowledge, that was never done.  In many ways, what we saw last night speaks to something I have raised on many occasions.<\/p><p>That is something this Government now has to deal with.<\/p> <p> On the issue of waiting lists, the Deputy may not be aware that the waiting list for procedures for inpatients and day cases has now fallen for three months in a row.  Part of that is down to the additional resources we are putting into our public hospitals.  Much of it is down to additional funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and I believe we will see waiting times falling for cataract and procedures such as hips and knees falling in the year ahead.  Between April and now, the overall number of people waiting for an ophthalmology procedure fell from 13,552 to 11,863, and the cataract waiting list has fallen from over 10,000 to 8,667.  We are starting to see results in terms of the additional money being given to the NTPF, and also the additional funding provided for insourcing, to do more work in our public hospitals.<\/p> <p> On the fundamental issue, the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the all-party report on the reform of health, one of the recommendations was that we take private practice out of public hospitals.  I agree with that; it is a good idea.  The report recommends that a commission be established to examine how that would be brought about.  It would be costly at approximately &euro;700 million in a year and would involve changes to contracts.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has already appointed that group, which is headed by Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir, to examine exactly how we can do that.  It would be - if and when it happens - a game changer for our public health system.  We would never allow what happens in our public hospitals to happen in our schools.  Children could not come in to be taught in a private class with fewer pupils and a teacher who is paid more to teach them.  We would never allow that, yet we allow it in our health service.  I do not think we should.  It means there are perverse incentives for hospitals to have more private patients because they can then generate additional revenues.  Our public hospitals get about &euro;700 million in additional revenues.  In addition to that there is a perverse incentive for the individual consultant to make more money in that way.  It has to change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200015#N00700","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511354400,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Did I hear the Taoiseach correctly when he said that the audit he sought as Minister for Health was never actually carried out?

Are they, in fact, working in a private capacity to the detriment of the people waiting on our public list?  That is of paramount importance.<\/p>  <p>  The figures the Taoiseach quoted regarding the waiting lists shrinking are explained easily.  The lists are shrinking because people have no choice but to go private.  People are selling their possessions to go private.  I have the figures for Cork and Kerry.

That is the fundamental action in terms of long-term reform.  In the interim, for people waiting for cataract operations and hip and knee operations, we are giving additional funding to the NTPF to allow those patients to go privately.  The NTPF does not just fund private hospitals.  It also does insourcing as well in places such as the Eye and Ear Hospital, for example, and Cappagh.

The Taoiseach stated, \"It will be a priority of Government in the months and years ahead to ensure that those parts of the country where the recovery has been slow will experience an acceleration in their recovery.\"  I respectfully ask the Taoiseach to have a look at the national planning framework document for 2020 to 2040, which proposes five major economic zones, namely, Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Cork.  There is nothing above the line from Dublin to Galway and no mention of Carrick-on-Shannon, Sligo, Donegal or Letterkenny.  The plan is flawed.  We do not want a fancy plan but balanced regional development where the north west has an equal chance of producing jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200017#P01800","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1511355000,"counter":215,"content":"<p>It is out for public consultation.

As I have said before, protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process is a priority, not just for Ireland but also for all remaining 27 member states.  Given that the UK Government has said the UK should leave the Single Market and the customs union, the onus is on it to indicate how the commitment to avoiding a hard border is to be realised within the parameters it has set.<\/p>  <p>  I engaged informally with Prime Minister Rajoy at the European Council in October and at the social summit in Gothenburg on 17 November.  I have not yet had a formal bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister, but I look forward to having a chance to have more detailed engagement in the near future. <\/p>  <p>  Ongoing political engagement with our EU and international partners remains crucial, especially as negotiations on Brexit proceed.

I briefed the council on our efforts in supporting and facilitating talks between the parties over many months and reaffirmed our commitment to continuing to work with the British Government and the parties to support the resumption of power-sharing in Northern Ireland as soon as possible. <\/p>  <p>  We discussed the common travel area, border and customs arrangements, and the transition to a post-Brexit environment for all member Administrations.

We raised with her a range of matters in respect of the current efforts to restore the political institutions.  One matter in particular that we raised with her, and that I want to raise with the Taoiseach this afternoon, is the decision the British Government has taken to include a statute of limitations or a proposal for amnesty covering all Troubles-related incidents involving British Crown forces in a new section in its consultation document, to be published shortly, on the Stormont House Agreement Bill.<\/p>  <p>  We have lost count of the number of meetings we have had with British Government officials on matters pertaining to the Stormont House Agreement.  At no stage was a statute of limitations or an amnesty mentioned by any of them as a possibility.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that the Irish Government was also unaware of the British Government's intention to include this new section on legacy?  This unilateral decision by the British Government is, I believe, in breach of the Good Friday Agreement and certainly of the Stormont House Agreement, which specifically dealt with legacy issues.  It is worth recording for the House that, on reaching the latter agreement, it was possible for all parties to agree the mechanisms for truth recovery and legacy.  That was a very important development.  Does the Taoiseach share my view that the British Government's approach is unacceptable?  It is evidence of bad faith in the midst of our efforts to restore the institutions.<\/p>  <p>  The Sinn F&eacute;in delegation also told Ms May that direct rule is not an option and that she needs to look to the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement for the establishment of the Intergovernmental Conference involving the Irish and British Governments.  In this respect, I welcome the Taoiseach's statement yesterday that, in the absence of an agreement on the institutions, he will be seeking a convening of the Intergovernmental Conference in the new year.  What was the British Prime Minister's response to this proposal when the Taoiseach spoke to her last week in Gothenburg?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200020#S02000","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1511356800,"counter":279,"content":"<p>It is difficult to take three separate questions in one follow-up question.<\/p>  <p>  On the British-Irish Council and the division between Governments on core objectives, the mounting evidence is that we are in the middle of an unprecedented crisis.  Over the past week, it has become absolutely clear that there is no effective working relationship between the two Governments.  The extent to which they are talking at each other through the media is increasing by the day.<\/p><p>I saw a bit more of that last evening at a function.  In addition to a crisis with the Good Friday Agreement, we have the disaster of a chaotic Brexit process.  Nearly a year and a half after the Brexit vote, nothing is clear and fears are increasing.  On Saturday night Deputy Adams said Brexit was a unique and historic threat to Northern Ireland, yet he and his party still see no reason to allow the Remain majority in the North to have a voice in the debate.<\/p> <p> However, there is an even bigger concern, which is that it no longer seems as if the Government and the British Government have any sort of constructive relationship and are failing to engage properly with each other.  I would like answers to the specific questions I pose.  Legislation currently before the House of Commons has major implications for Ireland.  Will the Taoiseach tell us whether he has made any submission to the British Government concerning the operations of the Good Friday Agreement post Brexit?  For example, this week amendments concerning European human rights law are being debated, something which is directly relevant to the foundations of the agreement.  What has the Taoiseach said to Prime Minister May about that?  There has also been an attempt to introduce unilaterally what is being termed a security forces amnesty in other legislation.  Has the Taoiseach been consulted on that?  If so, what did he say?  On the broader issue of the relationship, I get the sense that it is deteriorating week by week and that we are into a megaphone phase of engagement on Brexit, which ultimately and in the long term may not be to the benefit of anybody.  We need to reflect on that and the Government needs to reflect on that.<\/p> <p> On Catalonia and the question on Mr. Rajoy, the fundamental point is that a de-escalation of that crisis is in everybody's interest.  The idea that a partial referendum where 38% of the population voted is the final word or equally that the democratic leaders should be in prison are both unacceptable positions.  We need respect for the fact that neither side has clear legitimacy in terms of the wishes of the people.  Catalonian republicanism is not a violent republicanism.  It has never had to suffer from any type of illegitimate campaign of violence inflicted, for example, on the Irish people by what I would consider a minority at that time.  No one needs to waste years persuading people not to kill each other or to stop gangster-style enforcement of loyalty.  The Catalonians, irrespective of the sides they take, have been very democratic.  There is a need for dialogue and the Taoiseach should emphasise that when he meets the Spanish Prime Minister and urge a legitimate settlement between Catalonia and the rest of Spain through negotiated dialogue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200020#S02100","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511357400,"counter":281,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach is in a very challenging period as we move to decisions potentially being made in respect of Britain's relationship with the EU and almost certain withdrawal in terms of the current Government, but I still hope the British people might ultimately be in a position to rethink that.  At the end of the day this will come down to the Taoiseach being on his own in a room with 27 other Heads of Government and he will have choices to make.  I think it would be the wish of everybody here in the D&aacute;il to see those choices made as well as possible in the interests of the Irish people, the island as a whole, South as well as North, and also to move the country to a better place.  I appreciate that it is a very difficult and in a way a lonely decision-making process that the Taoiseach approaches but he needs to share more with the D&aacute;il about what his key elements are.  The Belfast Agreement, as an international agreement, offers a great deal of flexibility.  Does the Taoiseach see more opportunity at this point in both the North-South relationship but also in terms of the Intergovernmental Conference process and the east-west relationship.  I read the remarks yesterday of the British Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson.

My concern is that the general views of the British Government, as presented in terms of the solutions for Ireland when Britain exits the European Union, are completely unformed.  That is profoundly worrying.  Deputy Martin is correct.  The necessity of demanding focus has caused strains between the Irish and British Governments.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach was correct last weekend to be crystal clear on what is acceptable to Ireland.  It is time now to require clarity from the British side.  Generalisms will not suffice.  I offer the Taoiseach the support of my party in pursuing that line of clarity.  It is right for this country and it is right to demand that level of clarity.  I have no doubt the Irish Government will come under pressure between now and the date of the next European Council meeting from people who are now all aligned with the Irish position in phase 1 but who will anxiously want to get into phase 2.  I hope the Taoiseach will steadfastly maintain a position that it is impossible to move on to phase 2 without a definitive, clear, written understanding of how the Border issues on the island of Ireland are to be resolved.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to ask the Taoiseach a second question.  It is an odd amalgam of questions.  On the British-Irish Council meeting, the Taoiseach indicated that he discussed the Paradise Papers.  The Isle of Man and Jersey in particular facilitate tax avoidance.  Will the Taoiseach expand on the nature of those discussions?  Some of the British dependencies have very peculiar legal structures.  The Isle of Man, for example, is not part of the United Kingdom.  Are the islands subject to the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process?  Will they automatically share tax information, as 102 countries intend to do by next year with the revenue authorities of other countries?

Our position is and will remain that the rule of law, including the requirement under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights for effective investigations of unlawful killings, must be upheld by all responsible authorities.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government and the political parties to seek an urgent move forward on legacy issues by establishing the Stormont House framework in a manner that will meet the legitimate needs and expectations of all victims and survivors as well as contribute to the broader societal reconciliation as an integral part of the peace process.  The legacy process should not be about seeking to find an artificial balance or equivalence in investigations but rather about ensuring that we have a comprehensive approach.<\/p>  <p>  I was asked about the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  As I informed the House yesterday, in my meeting with the UK Prime Minister, Mrs. May, and her team on Friday morning in Gothenburg, I indicated that we would seek a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in the new year should the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in be unable to form an Executive before then.  We did not agree a date for the meeting but it is fair to say that our request is in the context of an international agreement - the Good Friday Agreement or Belfast Agreement.  I can see no reason it would be refused.  It is simply going to be a case of setting a date.<\/p>  <p>  The view the Government is taking, which I imagine everyone in the House will support, is that the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference deals with matters that are not devolved.  If nothing is devolved, then the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, by definition, deals with all matters.  That is the approach we are taking.  Naturally, both governments would prefer if it was possible for the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in to form an Executive.  However, if that is not the case, then the governments will meet to implement the Good Friday Agreement in the absence of the political parties in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to the relationship between the British and Irish Governments.  Personal relations are very good.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, has had any number of meetings with other Ministers, including the UK Foreign Secretary, Mr. Johnson, recently.  It was a long meeting.  I have met and spoken to the UK Prime Minister, Mrs. May, probably on more occasions than I can count in what has only been a six-month period in office.  At official level there is deep engagement all the time.  Often this goes on behind the scenes with those involved trying to understand each other's positions.  The difficulty is not so much one of relations or relationships but rather the enormous policy gap that now exists between a United Kingdom Government that wants to leave the European Union - it seems to be pursuing a hard Brexit policy by leaving the Single Market and customs union - and an Irish Government that accepts the decision the UK people have made but wants to protect our national interests, not only those relating to trade between Britain and Ireland but our national interests in respect of Northern Ireland as well.<\/p>  <p>  We always explain in meetings that for many people in the European Union these talks might be about the financial settlement or economics, but for us it is about far more than that.  Back 100 years ago our island was partitioned.  We have spent the past 20 years trying to remove borders and bring people together in Northern Ireland as well as bringing Northern Ireland closer to Ireland while respecting the constitutional settlement.  This is potentially a really major step backwards of historical significance.  For us, this is about far more than trade, the economy and money.  It is about far greater, deeper, bigger and historical issues.  I think that is understood but I am surprised it was not understood from the outset by more people.<\/p>  <p>  I agree absolutely with Deputy Martin that we need de-escalation of tensions in Catalonia.  There should be no violence either from people calling for independence or from state actors.  I agree with Deputy Martin's sentiment that a referendum in which only 38% of the electorate voted for independence should not be the final say on the matter.  We need dialogue.  I understand that elections are now planned.  I hope those elections proceed as normal.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to pick up on the questions from Deputies Burton and Howlin.  We have a paper.  It was published some months ago under the former Prime Minister, Deputy Kenny.  We do not need to update it greatly because things have not moved on all that much from what was set out in that paper in terms of options, our priorities and the potential consequences.<\/p>  <p>  We have also set out clearly our objectives, including the objective to retain the common travel area and all the associated rights, in particular rights of British and Irish citizens to live, work, study as well as access welfare, housing and education in both countries as though we were citizens of both.  We want the Good Friday Agreement to be honoured and implemented.  A mapping exercise has been done on all the different areas of North-South co-operation.  We want funding to be retained for PEACE and INTERREG programmes.  We are seeking a transition period in order that business, individuals and families can adapt to any permanent changes that may arise.  We want a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom in order that our farmers, businesses and exporters can continue to trade as they do now.  We also want the commitments that we have been given on the Border from the UK Government to the effect that there will not be a hard border, that there will not be any physical infrastructure on the Border and that any border will be frictionless and seamless, to be written down in such a way that we know the parameters for the phase 2 discussion.  The way I have explained it in media interviews with the British press and, more important, in my conversations with the British Prime Minister and her team is that we accept that the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union.  That is a decision of the British people.  However, the British Government has made a further decision to take the Single Market and the customs union off the table before we enter phase 2 talks on the new relationship.  The British Government has taken a political decision to narrow the parameters for the talks on trade and the new relationship.  We want the parameters narrowed as well.  What we want is to have the parameters narrowed in such a way that assures us that we will not have a return to the borders of the past, to use that particular language.  Again, that is set out in the European Commission task force paper in respect of how we believe that can be achieved.  The text is in the final paragraph.  We think it can be best achieved if the United Kingdom, either on behalf of all of the UK or on behalf of Northern Ireland, commits to regulatory equivalence, that is to say, that we will operate the same rules and regulations.  Without doing that, it is almost impossible to avoid some form of hard border.<\/p>  <p>  That is our position.  It is the position not only of the Irish Government but of the EU 27.  We are awaiting a response from the UK side, including an alternative proposal that we deem satisfactory.  We have not received that yet.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to pick up on the comments of Deputies Ryan and Howlin.  I very much appreciate their words of support for the position the Government is taking.  We could be into a difficult few weeks and months ahead.  This is potentially a historic decision for us.  I appreciate the fact that the Deputies are supporting the Government decision to hold firm on this.  We have the absolute support of the other European Union member states that are remaining.  We have not come under any pressure as yet to soften our position.  However, I am not so naive as to think that that may not occur.  We will avoid at any cost being isolated.  However, even if we are isolated, we have to hold to this position, in my view.<\/p>  <p>  I was asked about a meeting of the party leaders.  I think that would be welcome as we reach decision points.  Certainly, between now and the European Council on 14-15 December, that would be a very useful idea all around.<\/p><p>However, I want to be at a decision point, not just at a point of ten different hypothetical scenarios, which is a little bit where we are now.  I chose ten is a random figure by the way so there is no need to raise a query or ask a question as to what the ten scenarios are. <br\/><br\/>On the OECD and the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process, I do not know if the Crown dependencies are part of the OECD or BEPS process.  I learned all about the Crown dependencies when I was in Jersey.  They are not in the United Kingdom or the European Union but they voluntarily adopt all EU <i>acquis <\/i>and law.  As a result, they have access to the Single Market.  It is an interesting model. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200022#U00300","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511358600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>For the information of the House, we have expended almost 28 minutes on this group of questions.

The Department has more than 20 staff members working in the EU and international affairs division, for example.  It is also important to recognise that the role of the Department is to support my work, as Taoiseach and to co-ordinate the work of the Government and Cabinet.  We have Departments of Health, Finance and Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It is not necessary for my Department to replicate everything that is already in place across Departments.  It is not necessary, therefore, to have a housing office with a housing adviser or an education office with an education adviser in my Department.  That would be unnecessary, would duplicate work that is being done and would probably cause tension between my Department and other Departments if the latter were being second guessed all the time. <\/p><p>We have extensive expertise across Departments and it does not need to be replicated in mine.

It is one of the few Departments where the total budget is being reduced.<\/p> <p> In terms of politically appointed staff, those appointed by me, the total number I have - this, of course, includes staff who are assigned to the Independents and includes civilian drivers - is 19, as against 23 for my predecessor.  I have fewer staff than my forebear had politically appointed and he had many fewer, and they cost much less, than his forebears, the former taoisigh, Mr. Brian Cowen and Mr. Bertie Ahern.  One is seeing a reduction in the number of politically appointed staff in the Department and a reduction in the cost to the taxpayer of politically appointed staff, which is something that is worth at least putting on the record of the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p> In terms of capacity, we have extended the capacity in the EU and international affairs section of the Department to deal with Brexit but we also have the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

The housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme is a short-term interim solution for people who are looking for a permanent home.  It is a support measure for those people who cannot afford to rent in their own right and who are on their local authority's housing list.  I am from County Kildare and my constituency of Kildare North is on the commuter belt.  Accommodation in the area is much sought after for positive reasons and there are currently approximately 8,000 people on the housing list in Kildare, which is a massive number.  Those on the housing list need support and assistance in finding a permanent home, either through the local authority or by some other means.  We all know that there is a shortage of supply and there is no point in me dwelling on that point because it has been dealt with extensively in this House.  When one has a shortage of supply and a scarce commodity, the cost of that commodity will increase.  In that context, we have a number of options if we want to prevent people from becoming homeless and to help those who are homeless to find a home.  We can let them carry on as they are and do nothing while we wait on the supply to increase or we can review the current support mechanisms, which are not working in the case of County Kildare, and try to provide better support to people in order that they can access private rental accommodation.<\/p><p>We must be honest and acknowledge that private rental accommodation is the only show in town for those who are on the housing list and seeking accommodation.  In respect of those who show up to for viewings, for every family that has been approved for rental support there is another family that does not need such support, which is positive from the perspective of the latter.  However, the people who have qualified for HAP and who are on the housing list are at a disadvantage.  The Taoiseach acknowledged earlier today in the House that accommodation is very hard to come by.  We have all acknowledged that but now we need to do something about it if we are serious about preventing people from becoming homeless.  <\/p><p>The HAP scheme payment for a single parent or a couple with two children in County Kildare who are looking for a three-bedroom house is &euro;1,260 with 20% discretion but the current rental price for such a house in any part of north County Kildare is approximately &euro;1,450, so they are already around &euro;200 behind the line.  They also have to pay differential rent to the local authority based on their income.  In these circumstances, they are at a severe disadvantage in terms of securing private rental accommodation they can afford.  They are starting off way behind the line.  This is leading to an increase in homelessness and the situation is getting worse.  Even when the people who qualify for the HAP scheme view properties they know they will not be able to access them because the payments are inadequate.  I ask that those payments be reviewed in the short term until supply increases.  <\/p><p>There is also an issue with regard to the administration of the HAP scheme.  It can take up to three months for a payment to come through after one applies for the HAP scheme.  This also puts HAP applicants at a disadvantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>those who do not need rental support and who show up to viewings with a month's rent and a month's deposit in hand.  Landlords or landladies are not going to wait for three months for a payment.  If we are serious about dealing with homelessness we must help families to remain in their homes and we must also help families to get off the street.  The Government must take this issue seriously and review the HAP scheme.  We must do more to help homeless families to access homes.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200025#CC00300","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1511359500,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for raising this issue, which I am dealing with on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who cannot be here today.  I will begin by addressing the last point that the Deputy raised regarding the delay in the processing of applications for HAP.  The point he makes in that regard is a fair one and I will certainly take up that issue because local government is in my remit.  A reduction in the processing time is an objective that can be achieved.  That would greatly help people who are trying to put a roof over their heads.<\/p><p> The housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme plays a vital role in housing eligible families and individuals.  There are currently more than 29,800 households having their housing needs met via HAP and more than 20,000 landlords and agents in receipt of HAP payments.  A weekly average of 348 HAP tenancies have been set up during 2017 and over the past five weeks, the average rate has been more than 420 per week.<\/p> <p> As part of an A Programme for a Partnership Government commitment, the HAP rent limits were increased significantly by the Government in July 2016, and by up to 60% in some areas.  The Government also provided local authorities with statutory flexibility to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to a maximum of 20% where necessary, and 50% in the case of eligible homeless households in the Dublin region.  Both of these measures are allowing HAP households to find suitable accommodation and willing landlords.<\/p> <p> The local authority can determine, on a case-by-case basis, what level of support to provide, based on the tenant's current position and the needs of a household, as well as the market rents in that local area.  It is also open to authorities to take a consistent approach in regard to the provision of discretion in particular high-demand areas or in regard to a particular household type that might be faced with a shortage of suitable property in the area in which they wish to live.<\/p> <p> From available data, at the end of the second quarter of 2017 - excluding the additional discretion available to eligible homeless households in the Dublin region - 12.6% of HAP households nationally were benefitting from the flexibility introduced by the Government in 2016 to exceed the rent limits and the average level of payment agreed stood at 14.9% beyond the rent limits.  In the administrative area of County Kildare, 432 of the 1,128 households supported by HAP at that point, or approximately one in three households, were benefitting from the additional flexibility, with the average level of payment being agreed at approximately 13% beyond the rent limits.<\/p> <p> To address one of the particular difficulties in this area, local authorities are cognisant that increasing the HAP rent limits in particular areas could have further inflationary effects on the private rented sector, which could have a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support but are renting privately.  In this respect, any changes to the HAP rent limits could have a significant knock-on effect on the other measures taken by the Government in regard to the wider rental market, such as the rent pressure zones that have been introduced to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where rents are highest and rising, including Newbridge, Naas, the Deputy's area of Celbridge-Leixlip and Maynooth.<\/p> <p> In general, HAP applicants should be sourcing accommodation within the rent limits and the discretion available.  The data reported by local authorities show this is happening, by and large, and people who can benefit from HAP are able to access accommodation within the support limits in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200025#CC00400","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511360100,"counter":325,"content":"<p>With due respect, there is nothing in that statement.

We can be flippant about it, if the Minister of State wants.  I am asking him why people are homeless.  Let us analyse that.  The first reason people are homeless is that local authorities, through Government policy, are not providing them with a social house.  Second, people cannot access private rental accommodation because the limits are less than market value.  I am well aware of the consequences of doing it, but if we are not going to review this scheme and provide help to such families in the affected counties, rather than nationally, then we are saying to them that we are sorry but can do nothing.  If the current market value is, for example, &euro;1,450, and the discretion to which the Minister of State refers and which I have factored in is 20%, this brings it to approximately &euro;1,250.  We are saying the person is starting off over &euro;200 behind the line.  We know that and acknowledge it but we are not going to do anything about it for the moment, until stock comes into the market, which is at least two or three years away.<\/p>  <p>  I can see how seriously the Minister of State is taking this matter.  Kildare County Council officials have raised this with the Department and have identified that this is a real problem for parts of County Kildare where HAP is not going far enough.  This is adding to the homeless issue and adding to the number of people on the housing list who are not able to access the private rental market because it is unable to provide houses for them.  The question we have to ask is whether we want to help these families.  If we want to take them out of hotels and temporary accommodation or out of overcrowded family scenarios and provide them with some sort of short-term stable environment, I ask the Government to consider reviewing the points I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200026#DD00400","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1511360100,"counter":328,"content":"<p>The Deputy might learn some day that when he asks a direct question, he gets a script from the Department.

I know north Kildare very well and I know people who are involved in building in north Kildare.  Before he entered the House, Deputy O'Rourke was involved in construction himself, as far I remember.  He knows the shortages that exist in north Kildare, despite the pure failure on his part to observe anything I said in my response.  I opened my comments by saying that his point about the delay in processing applications was a valid one.  He went on to completely ignore that acknowledgement but also the wider implications for those in private rented accommodation that could come if there was a significant change in the HAP scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I indicated all along, including at the start of my comments, that there will be a review of the HAP scheme.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has said many times that the housing options that are available to local authorities and individuals are under constant review.  Deputy O'Rourke was a member of Kildare County Council and has not been a Member of this House for long.  He might go back to Kildare County Council and look at the &euro;6 billion in funding that is available from the central government to provide local authority houses.  He might also reflect on the time before he entered politics, when he was building houses and when Fianna F&aacute;il introduced legislation to privatise the building of public houses in this country - Part V and Noel Dempsey.  Does he remember that fellow?  I remember him.  I used to come up against him when I was in the Seanad at the time.  When the backside fell out of the private building sector in this country, there were no public houses that could be provided because Fianna F&aacute;il had given the job to private sector people who were involved in construction, like the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  I think there is plenty for the Deputy to reflect upon.

I have no doubt we are both disappointed.  Obviously, Ireland pulled out of its application for the European Medicines Agency in order to focus on the European Banking Authority but it is very disappointing.  The European Medicines Agency had some 900 staff working for it but, more than that, tens of thousands of people come to it every year for meetings, conferences and so forth.  The European Banking Authority is smaller, with only 167 staff, but it would have been a very useful signal to the world in terms of Ireland as a centre for financial services and as a centre of strong regulation in financial services, which is something we need.<\/p>  <p>  I was quite surprised to hear how it finally went.  Dublin got down to the last three and then, in voting, actually did better than Frankfurt, which is a great testament to the diplomats and all of the effort involved.<\/p><p>In the last round of voting, Ireland got more votes than Paris, which is where the authority ultimately went.  Despite this, agreement was somehow reached that the location for the European Banking Authority, EBA, would be pulled out of a hat.  Essentially, a coin was tossed.  I am sure that the Minister of State shares my disappointment that Ireland felt that it had to pull out of the European Medicines Agency, EMA, bid and lost to Paris on a coin toss on the banking authority.<\/p> <p> For Ireland, Brexit is mainly bad news.  We are in risk mitigation territory and the stakes are getting high in terms of Northern Ireland and border controls.  As such, I acknowledge the diplomatic efforts that were made.  The purpose of this debate is not to have a go politically, but it is a serious issue that we have lost out on this and it needs to be discussed by Parliament.  I am most keen to try to understand what we can learn.  I do not doubt that our diplomats did an excellent job, but we lost on both bodies.  We should have won one, given that we have a decent centre for financial services and a considerable number of large pharma firms from across the world.  There is a great deal of research and development and manufacturing taking place in Ireland.  Our partners in Europe recognise that we are the most exposed to Brexit.  While we withdrew our bid for the medicines agency, perhaps for good tactical reasons, we had a strong political and technical case for hosting it.<\/p> <p> I want to try to understand what we can learn from this.  Many businesses, organisations, jobs and economic activities will leave the UK or are in the process of doing so.  We must ensure that Ireland is placed as well as possible.  My understanding is that, while jobs in financial services are coming over, they are not at the level that was expected.  When I speak to financial services professionals in London and Brussels, they are surprised that many of the big names did not come to Ireland.  Professionals in London told me that Dublin had been at the top of the list for many of these names, yet they decided not to come here for various reasons.<\/p> <p> Between the two agencies, how many jobs has Ireland lost out on?  Will the Minister of State outline where we scored well and where we fell short in the evaluations?  In terms of the banking authority, were Ireland's regulatory capabilities an issue?  Was housing an issue, in that, if we had brought over 900 people from the medicines agency, would they have had somewhere to live?  Was the cost of living an issue, specifically housing, rent and child care?  Were locations in Ireland other than Dublin considered for these two bodies?  What does the Government believe we can learn from having tried hard and failed in order that we can increase our chances of securing other economic activity as Brexit unfolds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200026#DD00700","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511360700,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I have a script, but I will not read it.  Instead, I will discuss what we went through for a few minutes and then answer the Deputy's questions.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately two months ago, I started what was effectively a road trip.  In that time, I have been to 16 European countries.  This was done to put boots on the ground, meet finance Ministers and try to put forward the best case that we could for the EBA.  At the same time, the EMA was being pursued by officials from the Department of Health.  Perhaps a month ago, we made the determination that we would not win the EMA.  We had a choice between pursuing two bids or one.  Had we pursued two, we were of the view that we would not get into the round of three on either.  That calculation turned out to be correct.  We put in place a strategy to try to win one of the bodies.  A country could only win one; none could win two.  If a country won one, it would be excluded from hosting the second.<\/p>  <p>  We withdrew from the bid for the EMA because we had always believed that we had a greater chance of winning the banking authority.  That is why we prioritised it.  We put boots on the ground.  I thank the officials from the Department of Finance and, in particular, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, who put in a big shift, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, because the process was operated strongly for between four and six weeks.  We did everything we could to win one of the authorities.<\/p>  <p>  I will try to answer as many questions as I can.  The EMA and the EBA comprised approximately 900 and 200 jobs, respectively.  One of my first visits was to the banking authority in Canary Wharf.  Deputy Donnelly spoke about the bid, but this effectively turned out to be a political decision.  The Commission carried out different types of assessment in respect of the EMA and EBA.  It used a traffic light system for the former but not the latter, where it said that everyone was qualified.  I never encountered questions about our regulatory capabilities when visiting the 16 capitals.  Similar to the assessments performed by the Commission, issues of housing and the cost of living were not raised.  No city in Ireland other than Dublin was considered.  Primarily, the cities presented were capitals - Warsaw, Vienna, Paris, Brussels, Luxembourg, etc.<\/p>  <p>  As to what we have learned, I will not pretend.  Along with officials, I spent a large amount of time travelling.  I believed that we could get into the round of three and that, if we were up against Paris and Frankfurt, we could win.  I turned out to be incorrect.  We did not win, but we did not lose.  It went to the toss of a coin.  We have learned a major lesson.  There has been reportage on it, some inappropriately negative.  People have been saying that we have no friends.  We went head to head against the Germans and the French.  They are much larger countries than us.  We beat the Germans and, when their votes were distributed, we were level with the French.  The French did not beat us.  It was a hell of an achievement.  I thank the officials in the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs and Trade.<\/p>  <p>  I will finish on one point.  Our ambassadors and diplomatic corps on the ground have been superb.  Their work probably goes unnoticed to some extent.  They are professional and very capable.  As such, I thank Deputy Donnelly for viewing this issue in a positive light.  It is easy to take the Roy Keane view that, if we do not win, we lose.  We were not beaten and we did not win.  It went to the toss of a coin.  I am disappointed that we did not win on the toss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200027#EE00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1511360700,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for putting his script down.

Everybody who was asked to participate did so really well.  Many people did not believe we were in the race for the European Banking Authority.  Many were of the view that we had made an error withdrawing from the European Medicines Agency bid.  However, we said this was the only pathway for Ireland to get into the race for the European Banking Authority third round.  We said that if we got into that we would be very competitive, and we were.<\/p>  <p>  We had 13 votes after the second round.  The French had ten and the Germans had four.  The Germans were subsequently eliminated and its four votes were to be distributed in the next round.  One country chose to abstain by spoiling its vote and the French then got three votes.  It was 13 all and it went to a hat.  That was agreed beforehand.  I am not sure whether Deputy Donnelly is aware that the European Medicines Agency also went to a hat.  Milan and Amsterdam went into a hat before us at 13 all.  They are the facts.<\/p>  <p>  More money would not have made a difference.  We had a really good offering in terms of property solutions and staff relocations.  Money did not become the deciding factor.  Rather, it involved politics and larger countries, whereby Germany and France combined to level with Ireland.  All three German votes went the French.  The core levelled with the periphery.  That is the new dynamic and it is very interesting.  Perhaps we will have a chance to have a coffee after this debate.  That is the really big story in the European Banking Authority and European Medicines Agency because the Dutch, a smaller nation, also beat the Italians, a larger nation, and that vote was 13 all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200028#FF00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","time":1511361300,"counter":339,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200028#FF00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1511361300,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I, along with my colleagues, wish to raise the issue of the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise, specifically the action plan which has recently come into the public arena.

She is talking from both sides of her mouth as the decision has been made and she is ploughing on with this.  According to her, the only concern is the low volume of patients going through critical care in Portlaoise.  Answers have been put forward by local doctors in response.<br\/><br\/>The first plan was leaked to me almost four weeks ago now and one was leaked to the <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>and they spell out exactly what is supposed to happen.  The minor injury and medical assessment units will operate in the day time.  The paediatrics, maternity and the intensive care units will be gone.  According to <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>leak - these leaks are deliberate - 12 hospitals, including Portlaoise, will stop taking trauma patients and major trauma centres will be created in Cork and Dublin.  What absolute insanity.  Does neither the Government nor the Health Service Executive understand the need for a regional network of emergency units staffed and equipped to a modern standard?<br\/><br\/>Dr. O'Reilly has not taken on board the need for the &quot;golden hour&quot; to be taken into consideration.  This is the hour after a serious trauma, accident or injury.  She has not explained how these patients will be transported to Dublin, Cork, Tullamore or anywhere else.  The question is whether a patient is safer in the back of an ambulance or, in the first hour, getting to an accident and emergency department such as the facility in Portlaoise, which is well-established, well equipped and properly staffed.  There is also a shortage of ambulances, with only one ambulance in County Laois on Monday and Tuesday nights.  Will the Minister of State address that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200028#FF00600","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511361900,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for raising this matter.  At the outset I reassure the Deputies that, as my colleague the Minister for Health, has stated, the most important issue in the consideration of services at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, is that patient safety and outcomes must come first.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is committed to securing and further developing the role of the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise as a constituent hospital within the Dublin Midlands hospital group.  He has said he will bring clarity to this matter in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Reports on Portlaoise hospital in recent years have pointed to the need for restructuring of some services to ensure patients are treated in the most appropriate setting by specialist staff who can safely meet their needs.  Since 2014, the focus has been on supporting the hospital to develop and enhance management capability, implementing changes required to address clinical service deficiencies and incorporating the hospital into the governance structures within the Dublin Midlands hospital group.  Significant work has been undertaken to strengthen and stabilise current arrangements for services at the hospital to ensure services currently provided that are not sustainable are discontinued and those that are can be safety assured and adequately resourced.  The HSE has confirmed that hospital funding has increased by 28% relative to the 2012 budget and staffing levels have risen by 29% from the 2014 base.  Funding of &euro;300,000 has also been provided in 2017 to facilitate the opening of the new medical assessment unit.  In addition, governance and management arrangements in Portlaoise hospital have been strengthened, additional clinical staff have been appointed and staff training, hospital culture and communications have improved.<\/p>  <p>  The Dublin Midlands hospital group has been working for some time on a draft plan for a new model of clinical service delivery at Portlaoise hospital.  A draft plan was submitted to the Department of Health in December 2016.  This draft report was reviewed in detail and was the subject of engagement between Department officials and the HSE.  Significant additional work was undertaken by the HSE on foot of this engagement, resulting in a revised draft plan that was submitted to the Department in September 2017.  I emphasise again that patient and public requirements are paramount and have underpinned the Department's consideration of the draft plan.<\/p>  <p>  The report is currently under detailed consideration in the Department of Health.  Once there is an agreed position on the draft plan, it is intended there will be further engagement with all interested parties to ensure the needs of patients, staff and the local and wider community are addressed.  Any future changes to services at Portlaoise must take account of existing patient flows and demands in other hospitals, as well as the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise in the context of the overall service configuration in the Dublin Midlands hospital group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200029#GG00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1511361900,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Everybody in Laois and in this House would accept and agree that patient safety is the most important aspect of the services in Portlaoise but this plan does not achieve that goal.  In 2014, the Health Information Quality Authority, HIQA, produced a report at the request of the Minister and a second report was issued in December 2016.  I will quote the statement of Dr. O'Reilly from two days ago.  She states, \"Specifically, in December 2016 HIQA again highlighted significant patient risk at the hospital and found that the governance arrangement in the emergency department remained largely unchanged\" from 2014.  Who was the regional manager from 2014 to 2016 who did nothing?  In 2015, she announced the scaling down of the accident and emergency department, which did more than anything to undermine public and staff confidence.  It put people off coming to take up positions in Portlaoise.  Her actions before she put pen to paper to draft a report undermined the accident and emergency department.  People said it was not a place to go to further one's career.  That act did more to damage patient safety in Portlaoise hospital than any other action by any other person.  She has done more damage than good to Portlaoise hospital.<\/p>  <p>  She should have spent those two years upgrading the accident and emergency department, as it was done in the maternity section.  HIQA found problems in the maternity area and there are now management arrangements with the Coombe, as well as extra resources and staff.  The same is required in the accident and emergency department but she chose not to act.  As a result, we are where we are.  Looking at the national context of the report, one can see we need positive leadership for the region and somebody who will approach the matter positively so as to build services.  Who would ever speak about closing hospital services, as proposed in the document, with 680,000 people on waiting lists?  There is also talk of investment in the Coombe but the Government has already made the decision to close the Coombe hospital and move it to the St. James's Hospital site after the national paediatric hospital is built.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to meet Members now rather than after a decision is made.  Dr. O'Reilly wrote to me last week asking to meet and I will do that next Tuesday to discuss the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200029#GG00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1511361900,"counter":347,"content":"<p>The decision regarding retention of the accident and emergency department at Portlaoise hospital is in the hands of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who should be leading by example.

It has been stated that lessons have been learned from other downgrades but has the Minister learned any lessons?  More important, have such lessons been taken on board?  The Minister should be able to make a commitment as soon as possible that there will be no downgrading at Portlaoise hospital and he should seek to reassure people who are, at this time, very concerned about the possibility of a reckless and short-sighted decision being taken.  Such recklessness will put the lives of many patients at serious risk.  For example, we can look at attendance at the accident and emergency department at Portlaoise, which should be taken into consideration.  In 2016, there were a reported 39,212 visits to the department.  This demonstrates that the department is very busy and there is a need for extra resources.

I will focus on Naas General Hospital, which in some ways is inextricably linked with Portlaoise.  Many of the people on the Kildare-Laois border have a decision to make as to whether attend at Portlaoise or Naas.  The hospital at Naas services all of Kildare and west Wicklow, as the Minister of State is aware, and it is under very significant demographic pressure.  We have seen a major increase in our population in the past 20 years and the hospital now services over 240,000 people.  Last year the hospital saw a year-on-year increase in accident and emergency department attendance of 6.4%.  That is purely because of demographics and it must be said that the management is doing a remarkable job in managing this increase.  It is nonetheless at capacity.<\/p><p>We got funding to move 1,000 patients on a waiting list for endoscopy services.  They were dealt with through the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  However, that still leaves 700 people on a waiting list for those services.  We need the new endoscopy unit delivered for Naas General Hospital as soon as possible.  Naas is under that type of pressure already.  When we talk about the link with the services, what sets Naas apart from Portlaoise is that Naas does not have paediatric services.  I have two young children and live in south Kildare.  If there is an emergency situation, Portlaoise is the natural place to go.  Tallaght is an awful long way to travel with a sick child.  These are all causes of concern for residents of Laois and south Kildare.  There is uncertainty in the ether.

Portlaoise has always been on the back foot.  Ms Susan O'Reilly wants to spend &euro;100 million on a fantasy plan.  If &euro;10 million of that were given to Portlaoise, I guarantee that we would have a good, state-of-the-art, properly equipped hospital.<\/p>  <p>  In reply to a parliamentary question I raised over a week ago, the Minister gave an answer similar the one the Minister of State has just given.  It seems as if the Minister is kicking the can down the road, because he said, \"Once there is an agreed position on the draft plan, it is intended there will be a further engagement with all interested parties\".  The draft plan has been on the Minister's desk for the past year.  Who is to agree that position?<\/p>  <p>  We need certainty.  The answer to the parliamentary question and the reply here today do not give us any certainty.  We need confirmation of what is happening.  People in Laois and the surrounding counties are entitled to answers to that.  Reports on Laois are getting worse by the week.  It is obvious what is coming.  The Laois faculty of the Irish College of General Practitioners and Midoc have expressed a total lack of confidence in Susan O'Reilly.  She is due to retire in early January.  She will go, but the local community will still be there.  The people will be there.  This is her plan, but it is on the Minister's head as to whether it is signed off on.<\/p>  <p> The plan put forward by both the GPs and the Midoc staff mentions that, \"it is recognised internationally that attempting to centralise high volume essential services produces risks for patients and does not achieve cost savings\".

There has to be a regional network.  I want the Minister of State to take that message back to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  There has to be a regional network of fully equipped emergency departments.  Portlaoise is in the strategic location for that.  I want the Minister to come back quickly on this matter, secure the future of the hospital and put Ms O'Reilly's plan through the shredder.

That has no factual basis whatsoever.  \"It is damaging to Ireland's international reputation that our social response to the housing crisis is being portrayed as dysfunctional\", according to Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Community and Local Government, Deputy English.  \"When somebody becomes homeless, it does not happen overnight.  It takes years of bad behaviour, probably\", according to Eileen Gleeson, director of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  \"Homelessness is a dreadful thing, but it is a normal thing.  It happens\", according to Conor Skehan, chair of the Housing Agency.<\/p>  <p>  Last week was a bad week for the Government on the issues of homelessness and the housing crisis.  We saw an insidious, conscious campaign to normalise homelessness and to blame the victims of the housing crisis.  The message clearly went out, from the top of Government, to set free the Fine Gael within.  This happened.  The callous, Dickensian approach of Fine Gael to those who are the victims of the housing crisis and those who are homeless was on full display.  It was hard to conceive that it could get any worse, but it has.  On the very day that record homeless-rough sleeper figures are released - 184 people, which is clearly an understatement - the Government is set to oppose our Bill.  It is a simple Bill, which would mean that planning permission will be required for anti-homeless devices such as spikes, bars and sprinkler systems designed to discourage homeless people from seeking some shelter.  It is a Bill which would allow local councils effectively to ban such devices through local development plans.  I am awaiting the Government's reasoning for opposing such a basic, simple measure.  Fundamentally, the Government has to decide if it is in favour of these anti-homeless devices.  Is it in favour of sending a message to homeless people that they are not welcome and that they should move on?  Is it in favour of making it even more difficult for rough sleepers to find some shelter from the elements that we have seen in recent days?  That is what the Government's vote, and the vote of Fianna F&aacute;il, will represent if they take that step, as I believe they will.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a proliferation of these devices around our cities, and, shamefully, leading the charge was the Department of Social Protection, as it was known, under the then Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, which has perhaps 50 bars in front of Gandon House, across the road from Connolly Station, to prevent rough sleepers from sleeping or resting outside that public building.  People walking around will see them in Henry Street, Grafton Street, O'Connell Street, Temple Bar and right across Dublin city, and in towns and cities around the country.  The approach that lies behind them could sum up the approach and the attitude of the Government, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, which appears to be see no homeless, hear no homeless, help no homeless.<\/p>  <p>  The way we are heading with these devices was demonstrated last week by Waterways Ireland, which gave a written notice to quit to homeless people, with nowhere else to stay, who were living in tents along the banks of the canal.<\/p><p>It then proceeded to flood the area, literally to force them on their way.  Waterford Whispers News captured it perfectly: &quot;Government Unveil New 'Homeless Plough' To Clear Streets During Winter&quot;.  If only it was just a joke and not close to the truth of the approach this Government is taking.  We are heading in the direction of cities in America like Seattle, where they have homeless sweeps when they go into areas of the city where there are homeless people and sweep them out of the way on a regular basis in order that people do not have to see them, despite the fact that people protest and mobilise against these actions.  That is the approach this Government is driving towards and which is encapsulated by opposing this Bill.<br\/><br\/>I presume the Government will disingenuously ask: &quot;Sure, is this the best that Solidarity can offer people sleeping on the sides of public buildings?&quot;  Obviously, it is not but in the past couple of weeks we have heard from homeless people, and from people active in fighting against homelessness, about the insufficient number of shelters, people only being able to access sleeping bags and the many people who do not want to go into emergency accommodation because of the difficult conditions in such places, especially in the form of drug use.<br\/><br\/>We put this Bill forward to deal with one part of a huge housing crisis that affects most people in this State in some way or another.  The profit-driven property market, the refusal of the Government and councils to build public homes and the absence of real rent controls have meant most people have been forced down at least one rung of the so-called property ladder.  Those who previously would have bought homes now cannot afford them and only the top 15% of earners can get mortgages to enable them to buy homes.  Instead, they rent.  Those who previously rented now cannot afford to do so because, to be able to rent a one-bed apartment in this city on an affordable basis, a person needs to be on a salary of &euro;42,000, which is quite a bit above the average.  The 500,000 young people in this category are trapped at home or forced into substandard accommodation like bedsits.  Those who cannot afford rent for bedsits or substandard accommodation, such as low-paid workers, are forced into emergency accommodation.  Right at the bottom of the rung in terms of the impact of this crisis are those who have been kicked off the ladder entirely, those 184 people who we have now heard are rough sleeping in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>We are concerned with the whole ladder and the whole of society.  Tony Benn once said, &quot;The way a government treats refugees is very instructive because it shows how they would treat the rest of us if they thought they could get away with it.&quot;  The same is true for how the Government treats rough sleepers and homeless people generally.  It is also true of how this Government and previous Governments have treated Travellers, such as with the 90% cut in the accommodation budget in the course of the crisis, and refugees and asylum seekers in the open prisons of direct provision.<br\/><br\/>If people are being pushed down the ladder, there is another side where people are going up the ladder.  There are 15,000 extra dollar millionaires in this country compared with last year and 63% of homes that have been bought in the past few years were bought by cash buyers, which include vulture funds and rich individuals.  Cairn Homes owns 20% of residential land in Dublin and could build 12,000 homes but, instead, built just 94 in the course of 2017.  Stephen Kinsella put it well in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>at the weekend, writing that property owners were the people quietly benefiting from a crisis experienced by the young and the poor.  He said our shortage was in housing and the result was misery for the poorest and happiness for the wealthy.  Karl Marx put it more dramatically in <i>Capital<\/i>: &quot;Accumulation of wealth at one pole is ... at the same time accumulation of misery ... at the opposite pole&quot;.<br\/><br\/>There are winners and losers from this housing crisis.  The winners are the vulture funds, the big landlords and the developers the Government represents and the losers are everyone else - the rough sleepers, those in emergency accommodation, those facing unaffordable rent rises, those facing evictions and those who cannot afford to buy a home.  The Government is callously indifferent to the need of all those people for a home and it repeatedly puts the right to profit of the winners before the rights of the others to a home.  Fundamentally the Government does it, in the words of the Minister, because of its neoliberal ideology which means an absence of money and resources to build public homes.  Figures this week show the incredible situation that councils have landbanks on which 38,000 homes could be built but that, since 2016, just over 1,000 have been built, between direct council homes and housing associations.  In the four Dublin local authorities, with a combined waiting list of 33,000 families, just ten homes have been built this year.<br\/><br\/>The answer is quite simple.  As a small step, pass this Bill tomorrow, implement a housing first strategy and recognise that the only solution to homelessness is for people to have homes.  Build public homes, council and affordable homes, on a massive scale on public land to resolve this crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200030#HH00900","speaker":"1433","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511363100,"counter":359,"content":"<p>We are not suggesting for one minute that this piece of legislation is the solution to the housing crisis or homelessness.  This Bill is simply a measure to ensure that people in the most desperate situations, who are victims of the failure of successive Governments and housing authorities, are not further persecuted and victimised beyond what they have had to endure so far from the lack of long-term solutions to the housing and homelessness crisis.  It cannot be described as anything else.  People are now putting sprinkler systems to sprinkle cold water on homeless people lying under doorways outside shops or businesses.  As if it is not bad enough that their lives are in danger or that, when they ring an emergency number, they cannot get accommodation which they are not terrified to go into because of the drug use and alcohol problems in hostels and the fear that their clothes and goods will be stolen, meaning they are forced to sleep on the street, they then have to face the humiliation and indignity of a sprinkler system set up to sprinkle cold water on them while they are sleeping on the streets in winter.  In other cases, spikes, bars and other barriers are put up to prevent them finding some sort of shelter from the cold and the elements.<\/p>  <p>  I will not believe the credentials of the Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy English, or the Taoiseach until we get an apology for statements made in the past couple of weeks on this unprecedented homeless crisis.  The Taoiseach should not tell us he has compassion or that the Opposition does not have a monopoly on compassion.  He should apologise for suggesting the homelessness situation in this country is somehow normal by international standards.  That minimises a shocking and unacceptable crisis.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, suggested that those who continue to protest and shout out about the homelessness crisis are somehow damaging our international reputation.  What a shocking attempt to turn the tables on those who are calling out the failure of the Government and the authorities to deal with this obscenity.  Is the Minister going to demand an apology from Eileen Gleeson of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, who made the extraordinary statement that people ended up homeless as a result of years of bad behaviour?<\/p><p> That is a shocking statement for anyone to make, or for Conor Skehan, head of the Housing Agency to talk about homelessness in this country being normal.  If that is the attitude at the top, a situation which is already disastrous is destined to get worse.  There should be apologies for this.  The Government should pull back from this cynical and obviously orchestrated campaign, probably run by the strategic communications unit, to try to minimise the crisis.  The Government needs to face up to it and do anything possible to stop the further persecution, suffering and hardship of people who are at the sharp end of this catastrophic failure by housing and governmental authorities.  That is all this Bill does.<\/p> <p> Beyond that, it allows for the right of advocacy groups, the homeless themselves and others to oppose planning permission for anti-homeless measures - the phrase itself is extraordinary.  What will happen if we do not stop these anti-homeless measures is that we will get more deaths.  If someone cannot sleep under a shelter that exists at the side of an office building or shopping centre, or under a bridge at a canal, where will he or she end up sleeping?  Will this person magically get somewhere to stay?  No, he or she will not.  This person will end up sleeping in an even more dark, dingy, dangerous, unhealthy environment, down a back lane where we know that the likelihood of death is greatly increased, and deaths will increase significantly.  That is what this specific measure proposes: it is to end the further persecution of the homeless.<\/p> <p> Beyond that we are saying that the solution to this crisis is a massive increase in directly provided council housing on public land, rent controls that bring rent down to affordable levels, where rents are set at levels to prevent vulture funds or unscrupulous landlords from increasing rents to unaffordable levels, and stopping economic evictions by landlords or vulture funds.<\/p> <p> I will conclude by answering why we keep going on about council housing.  I have heard the Government's response, which accuses us of only wanting to talk about council housing but we are providing other types of social housing which is just as good.  It is not just as good.  There is a reason we are going on about council housing and its miserable levels of delivery.  Can the Minister answer how many council houses were built in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, which is one of the best performing areas for meeting the Government's targets?  There were six.  There are 6,000 people on the housing list and that will be 10,000 by the end of the year.  Last year the council managed to build 54, so the figure is decreasing but they look better because we have approved housing bodies and more Part 5 schemes.  That is not good enough and I will give a few examples why that is the case.<\/p> <p> Nicola is 13 years on rent allowance and after all that time she is 98th on the list.  She has four children, of 13 years, nine years, three years and one eight months.  All four children are in one bedroom.  The mother's bedroom is too small for even the travel cot that the eight month old is in.  The three year old is also in a cot which is far too big for the room and the 13 and nine year olds are in bunks and have to get dressed in the one bathroom.  They have no hope of getting housed.  She does not want to get a HAP, which is social housing, because at least the landlord of this rotten, insufficient, over-crowded place happens to be a not-bad landlord who will not evict her.  If she goes to a HAP house that could be slightly bigger, she could be evicted and homeless again within weeks because HAP is not like a council house.  One can be evicted from it and people are regularly.<\/p> <p> In the case of the Joyce family, there had been ten of them in a two bedroom house.  Most of the members of that family have been in and out of homeless accommodation all their lives.  Kayley, who is one of the children in the family, and is now a mother herself, decided that emergency accommodation would be better than living in those overcrowded conditions, with ten people over three generations in a chronically overcrowded house.<\/p> <p> Sarah Jane has four children.  Her sister, who also had four children, passed away and now she looks after eight children in a three bedroom house and no garden.  She is in an approved housing body house.  The problem in this case is that it is not possible to transfer from approved housing bodies to a council house because of overcrowding.<\/p> <p> HAP is not like a council house.  It does not give the sort of security, support and backup that a council house provides.  That is why we keep going on about council houses, but the Government continues to resist building them or is doing so in miserable numbers even though, as highlighted last week, we have sufficient land to build 38,000 council houses, where last year the Government built 400.  The targets are miserable compared to demand.  That is the solution: the Government must start using public land and resources to build council houses so we adopt a serious long term solution to this crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200031#JJ00200","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511363700,"counter":361,"content":"<p>As we face the crisis in homelessness and work to resolve it and help these people our first priority must be those who are most vulnerable, namely those who are sleeping rough.

Next year we will build almost double the figures built by local authorities, housing bodies and social houses this year which was four times the 2015 figure.  We will not return to the era of monotenure massive social housing estates because we do not believe in segregation and division, but in mixed communities.  That is what we are doing with Rebuilding Ireland.  There is &euro;6 billion of capital ring-fenced with which we can provide for the needs of people on our social housing lists.  We will be able to get people out of homelessness into secure, supported accommodation. That is what the Government is trying to do.  We will not use this issue as a political football.<\/p>  <p>  At a housing summit in September, I emphasised the need for all local authorities to have sufficient emergency beds and appropriate facilities for every person sleeping rough on any night of the week.  Today, the Dublin Region Housing Executive has reported a total of 184 people who were sleeping rough across the Dublin region on the night of 7 November 2017.  We are in the process of delivering 200 permanent emergency beds so that a bed and all necessary supports will be available to anyone who needs it.  All these beds will be brought into use over coming weeks and will be in place by 18 December.  There are already 1,850 beds in supported temporary accommodation to which these 200 are in addition.<\/p>  <p>  Exit from rough sleeping into Housing First will continue in parallel with this work.  We support the Housing First model, for which we put beds in place and in coming weeks I will appoint a national director for Housing First.  The Dublin Region Housing Executive will also implement its targeted programme to reach out to all those sleeping rough and provide them with the interventions and supports they need.  Housing First is the best solution, but some people need beds immediately which these new beds will provide on a permanent basis.  These supports are being put in place with partner organisations.  The facility I visited today on the Cabra Road will be funded by the Exchequer and operated by our partners in the Peter McVerry Trust.  The people who use this facility will also have access to a range of health and welfare supports, as well as food and sanitary facilities which they would not have on the streets.  Facilities such as the ones being delivered between now and Christmas will enable some stability so that the housing authorities and the HSE can work with individuals to see how they might exit homelessness into independent living.  These beds are not just for the Christmas period.  They are not temporary beds: they are permanent emergency supports.  Our first priority when dealing with homelessness must be to look after those who are most vulnerable and that is the 180 people, and more, who are sleeping rough on the streets tonight, to get them safe shelter and sustainable supports.<\/p><p>We are entering a cold weather period when people will be particularly vulnerable and it is imperative that we have in place a co-ordinated and robust response for anyone who might be sleeping rough over this period.  Accordingly, I requested that a contingency arrangement be put in place in the event that any additional requirements arise during the winter and cold weather period.<\/p> <p> I welcome the DRHE's cold weather strategy, which was published today.  This will see the availability of a further 50 temporary beds, if required, in addition to the 200 new beds that were also announced.  There will be more than enough spare capacity in the system as an additional precaution.  The cold weather strategy can also be activated during more extreme weather conditions.  We saw the response for vulnerable homeless people during the recent Storm Ophelia, which was testament to that.  This was implemented with our partner organisations in the voluntary sector.  Given the cold weather expected over the coming days, arrangements are in place since last night with our partners, such as the Peter McVerry Trust and Focus Ireland, to ensure that additional temporary shelter will be brought into use across a range of existing services and facilities for single people and couples on a temporary basis.  A contingency emergency response is in place permanently for any family who may be at risk of sleeping rough at any time.  These beds are in addition to the 40 emergency beds that have already been delivered in the past number of months.<\/p> <p> Across the country, cold weather plans and initiatives are also being advanced.  Local authorities in major urban centres have confirmed to me that they have robust contingency arrangements to meet any additional homelessness requirements as they arise during the winter period.  In Cork, an additional 25 temporary beds are in place.  In Galway, 34 temporary beds are in place.  In Limerick, an additional ten temporary beds are in place.<\/p> <p> As the emergency beds and facilities are delivered over coming weeks, the DRHE has a targeted plan and programme to reach out to all rough sleepers and provide them with the interventions and supports that they need.  As I have stated, my priority was to deliver permanent emergency accommodation in 2017 and there will be enough beds in place by the end of the year to meet the needs of all those who are currently rough sleeping.  The officials in my Department and I will continue to monitor and review the situation as the winter progresses.<\/p> <p> We continue to face a crisis in homelessness.  However, the situation is beginning to look like it is stabilising in Dublin, which is where our homeless problem has been most severe.  The numbers continue to increase outside of Dublin, however, so we must take the actions that have arrested the increase in Dublin and apply them elsewhere.  In October, the Dublin region experienced a decrease of one in the number of homeless adults and the number of families in emergency accommodation increased by one despite 88 new families entering services during the month, meaning that 87 families successfully exited homelessness in the same period.  This follows two months of a decline in the numbers of families in emergency accommodation in Dublin.  In the same month, the number of families exiting commercial hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation also reduced from 690 to 676, which is 22% decrease in the number of families in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation since the high point of March 2017.  Last week, during Private Members' business, I spoke about the new family hubs which provide family appropriate transitional accommodation.  I can now say that between now and January 2018 an additional 185 hub spaces will become available in Dublin and an additional 45 spaces in Limerick.<\/p> <p> Since the beginning of Rebuilding Ireland, in addition to securing housing for those who have already lost their homes, DRHE has worked tirelessly to prevent people from losing their homes.  This has resulted in more than 600 preventions of homelessness in addition to more than 2,000 exits from homelessness since the beginning of this year.  That is more than 2,600 people who would be homeless today if not for the coordinated efforts led by the DRHE and Eileen Gleeson.  This is the product of many hours and weeks of work by the DRHE.  We ask those who feel they are at risk of homelessness to link in with the DRHE at the earliest opportunity so that it, with its partner Threshold, can begin, in the first instance, to prevent the eviction or, where this is not possible, put the correct supports in place to ensure the housing needs of the household are met.<\/p> <p> The number of people accessing emergency accommodation in October was 8,492 nationally.  This comprises 5,298 adults and 3,194 dependants.  While the figure has increased, the rate of increase is much smaller and we are seeing the number stabilising in the Dublin region.  The delivery of homes is key to meeting the needs of those experiencing homelessness.  We will provide social housing solutions for more than 21,000 individuals and families this year and my Department, local authorities and approved housing bodies will continue to work closely, quickly and proactively to identify further solutions and increase social housing supports so we can give those in emergency accommodation the help they need.<\/p> <p> I am concerned that the effect of this Bill is to imply that rough sleeping is somehow acceptable and that owners or tenants of properties should in some way support this or at least not prevent it.  We are well aware of the many anti-social behaviours that happen, unfortunately, on our streets during the day but we have the supports in place at night for rough sleepers to get them into secure accommodation, keep them safe and then get them into successful pathways to more sustainable accommodation in the future.  I fundamentally disagree that this Bill is an appropriate response to homelessness.  I believe that providing Housing First is a better solution and I know that I am supported in that view by our housing partners, such as the Peter McVerry Trust, which supports the Housing First model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200032#KK00400","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511364300,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Peter McVerry supports this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200033#LL00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1511364300,"counter":366,"content":"<p>He supports this Bill as well.

We all know that emergency accommodation should only be a first response.  We want all homeless people - individuals and families - to be moved on to more permanent housing quickly.  Many homeless individuals have complex needs that require supports beyond housing.  We must work with the homeless individuals one-on-one so that root issues can be addressed and managed to help with independent living in the long term.  This includes rough sleepers, long-term users of emergency accommodation, young people exiting care and those exiting institutions such as prisons and hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The Housing First programme is critical in this regard and provides direct access to housing and intensive health, addiction and personal supports required for people who are homeless and have complex needs to maintain their tenancies.  While using this model, 180 new tenancies have been created in Dublin under a consortium contract between the DRHE, Focus Ireland and the Peter McVerry Trust.  We are now extending Housing First to all major urban areas outside of Dublin.  The housing authorities in Cork, Limerick and Galway are working closely with the HSE and non-governmental organisations with a view to delivering 100 tenancies starting next year.  As I said earlier, we are moving to appoint a national director of Housing First, who will be recruited shortly, to support the delivery of this important programme.<\/p>  <p>  This programme is being extended to other urban areas and we will work with the HSE and NGOs to ensure that those tenancies are delivered next year.  In addition, &euro;350,000 in funding is being provided to NGOs to appoint exit co-ordinators to support those exiting homeless services and report to the DRHE.  The homeless inter-agency group established following the housing summit in September to deliver homeless services in a coherent and joined-up way between the relevant Departments and agencies has also met on several occasions and is working specifically to improve the homeless help supports and mental health addiction services in emergency accommodation facilities.  In 2018, community mental health services and support teams will engage with homeless action teams to improve outcomes for people who are homeless and have mental health issues.  Multidisciplinary teams, addiction and mental health and primary care will be part of the Housing First initiatives for individuals in Dublin and other main urban areas.  These are real, tangible services and supports available to individuals who find themselves in this unfortunate situation which can have a meaningful and positive impact on their lives.  They are more structured, more secure and safer and more likely to lead to a long-term solution for homeless people than the proposals in the Bill.

It is sad to hear the contention that Inland Waterways somehow allowed the level of a canal to be raised to force those who were living in tents on the side of the canal to move.  This should be investigated and the situation clarified.  Rather than ruling this Bill out of hand, if actions such as those contended are prevalent, there is an opening for the Minister to explore whether, in the course of planning applications, guidelines could provide for such measures instead of disbarring genuine attempts by property owners, business owners and land owners to protect their property as they see fit from, as I said, intruders, burglars and vandals, especially given the week that is in it and the debate last night on the vast up-scaling in the level of crime in both rural and urban areas.<\/p><p>It is sad to hear the frustration and anger expressed by many people and their fears for their property and themselves.  It is sad they are contemplating the provision of Tasers and other weaponry to protect themselves and their property rather than joining the Garda Reserve or ensuring the Government lives up to its obligation regarding the recruitment of garda&iacute; and their deployment where required.<\/p> <p> I do not wish to enter into another protracted debate on the housing crisis because I, along with many others here, have made suggestions and proposals, passed motions and introduced Bills in this regard.  One such Bill, on vacant sites, fast-tracking the provision of units over shops and providing accommodation in towns, villages and cities much more quickly than at present, will be taken on Committee Stage tomorrow.<\/p> <p> Bearing in mind the background to the legislation under discussion, it is sad that people in positions of strength and power have definitely given the public the impression, in an orchestrated way or otherwise, that our homelessness crisis is somehow normal and that we compare reasonably well against international norms.  The figures collated in the first page of the OECD report constitute a warning against doing this, as has been said by many others.  The comments of the Taoiseach, the Minister, his Minister of State and the chairman of the Housing Finance Agency some months ago to the effect that there was no housing supply problem and the more recent comment that our figures are somehow normal are a sad reflection on them.  They have sought to retract or clarify the comments but, as was stated, perhaps it is time for them to put their hands up and say they were inappropriate, ill judged and wholly unsatisfactory and that they apologise for having made them and for the effect they have had on society.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State got completely muddled when he said the international reputation was being damaged because many firms that wish to locate here in our cities and regions are worried that, if they do, there will be a major question mark over the provision of housing and affordable housing.  Today I met representatives of IBEC in my region, the midlands, and they were laying out their stall in the context of the national planning framework.  One of the recurring themes, from company after company, was that of housing and its availability and affordability.  It is now proving to be an obstacle to them in attracting a relevant and well-qualified workforce.<\/p> <p> I accept the intent of the Bill.  I am surprised, worried, alarmed and saddened that it was felt necessary to put forward a measure such as this.  I do not support it but I do believe there is an opportunity, under the planning guidelines and legal framework, for the Minister to address the matter and ensure that nobody is planning developments with a view to preventing the homeless from having a refuge.  God forbid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200033#LL01100","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511364900,"counter":376,"content":"<p>The intention behind this Bill is worthy.  We all agree there is a problem with the construction of spikes that prevent rough sleeping.  It is a sad reality that, on the streets of our cities and towns, homeless people seek shelter in doorways and porticos.  It is regrettable that property owners feel the need to place spikes at ground floor points to prevent this.  Introducing planning legislation to prevent the placement of spikes is the wrong way to counter the practice, however.  In our view, planning guidelines should state the specific security measures and locations that require and do not require planning permission.  This would involve each local authority taking account of the particular circumstances of its area, for example, the acute circumstances of rough sleepers in Dublin city centre compared with circumstances in rural local authority areas.  A common-sense approach would involve not only each local authority but also, in the Dublin example, local chambers of commerce co-operating to ensure spikes that are unsafe, unwelcoming and ugly are avoided at all costs.<\/p>  <p>  Most home and business owners are willing to engage with the practical issues that arise from rough sleeping on our streets.  The text of this Bill is so poorly drafted, however, that its effect could easily have an impact on the legitimate rights of property owners to protect their homes and businesses from criminal damage or burglary.  The critical section of the Bill states, \"development shall not be exempted development which has the object or effect of deterring a homeless person from obtaining shelter from a structure, building or land\".  This is a very broad definition as nearly all legitimate security measures could easily be said to have the effect of deterring a homeless person.  This is not the intention but I repeat to those who introduced this Bill that this is the wrong way to deal with planning matters such as this.<\/p>  <p>  Just last night, this House debated the dreadful fear that home owners and businesses are experiencing because of rural crime.  Rural property owners, in particular, are vulnerable to being attacked, almost at will, by gangs that use our roads, such as the M11 and N81, to target properties all over Wicklow.  This Bill could easily be misused to deter rural property owners from using legitimate security measures to protect themselves, their families and their properties from these criminal gangs.  One has only to read the text to realise what I am talking about.  I have been dealing with planning applications for more than 15 years, so I know the implications of the text.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is not workable, not practical and can be easily be misinterpreted.  The issue of homelessness, with all the human tragedy it entails, and the issue of rough sleepers deserve far more comprehensive treatment than is evident in this Bill, however well-intentioned.  There are complex reasons people are forced to sleep on our streets.  Irish people are compassionate and regard the homelessness crisis as an unacceptable blight on their society.  The Parliament of the people must take this crisis as seriously as it has taken the financial crisis.  This Government still does not get it, and it still regards this crisis as normal.  This is not good enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200034#MM00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1511364900,"counter":377,"content":"<p>My colleagues, Deputies Cowen and Casey, have been front and centre in addressing the housing crisis and have put forward some key priorities from Fianna F&aacute;il's perspective.   We have put forward numerous Bills, such as the Vacant Housing Refurbishment Bill, to get to grips with the crisis.  We successfully pressed for further investment in social housing.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has claimed homelessness is not increasing and that it is low by international standards.  That is simply untrue and misleading.  The most recent figures show a total of more than 8,000 people homeless in Ireland, a record high.  Nationally, there are in excess of 5,000 adults and 3,000 children homeless.  This points to a clear example of a Government that has focused on spin over substance to date and that has downplayed the prevailing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The change that is proposed will impose a larger burden on property owners in proving that minor development is required.  Currently, there are more than 100,000 on social housing waiting lists.  Despite this high number, only 658 social houses were built last year.  In addition, rents have soared to in excess of 32% above the peak in 2008.  This means that Dublin city dwellers are spending as much as 55% of their take-home pay on rent alone.<\/p>  <p>  The high house prices, combined with the Central Bank's restrictive rules, have meant that the home ownership level has reduced to a record low of 69% throughout the country.  This is largely because the Government has scrapped the affordable housing scheme of 2011 and never re-established it.  Although the Government launched its housing plan several times, it has not built a single unit in a number of counties.  It has deliberately removed local authorities' role and slashed the Part V proportion to 10%.<\/p><p>This restrictive policy has meant that the State is well behind.  To put the numbers into perspective, in 2007 to 2010 Fianna F&aacute;il built more than 14,000 social houses.  That is, on average, more than 3,500 per year and 117 homes per local authority per year.  The record high for Fine Gael is between 2011 and 2016 when it built 3,050 social houses, which is 508 houses per year, on average, and only 16 per local authority per year.  The approach Fianna F&aacute;il would take is different in that it would focus on the home first.  We would focus on new units and wraparound service.  We believe HAP recipients should not be removed from the social housing list.  In order to make homes more affordable, we would establish a new affordable home purchase scheme on State lands, as well as establishing an affordable rent scheme on State lands.<\/p> <p> When we talk about homelessness and the housing crisis in Ireland and while I accept much of what has been said today, there is a perception that it only affects the larger urban areas.  Even in rural constituencies such as mine in Cavan-Monaghan, people are on the social housing waiting list for three to four years.  My local authority does not seem to have the capacity or wherewithal to build the types of developments that are needed when it comes to social housing.  We have generations of families, including married couples, living with their parents because they cannot get on the property ladder and own their own home.  In his endeavours to address this crisis I also ask the Minister to recognise the fact that it is not just urban areas where housing issues arise.  It is also an issue in rural areas, especially when it comes to council housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200034#MM00300","speaker":"1271","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511365500,"counter":379,"content":"<p>C&eacute; mh&eacute;ad n&oacute;imead at&aacute; f&aacute;gtha?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200035#NN00200","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1511365500,"counter":380,"content":"<p>C&uacute;ig n&oacute;im&eacute;ad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200035#NN00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1511365500,"counter":381,"content":"<p>Roinnfidh m&eacute; dh&aacute; n&oacute;im&eacute;ad d&oacute; sin leis an Teachta Breathnach.  I wish I had a much longer time to address the Bill.  The first thing that is obvious from the Bill is that the local authority will be required to read into the mind of the proposer of a development as to the purpose of the development.  That will give rise to a very strange situation.<\/p>  <p>  The greatest scandal of housing in this country, as well as people sleeping in the streets, is the way that over a long period, Travellers have not been properly accommodated in suitable Traveller-specific accommodation or in houses, whichever is their choice.  There has been a total failure of society in general to deal with this issue.  The Bill would provide an out to local authorities to continue to renege on their responsibilities to deal with this issue and to continue with irregular housing arrangements that Travellers are forced to adopt.  It is time that we dealt with the Traveller housing issue.  I have been working with Travellers for many years.  One of the greatest scandals was the Carrickmines fire but an even greater scandal was the aftermath of the fire, where locals objected to the rehousing of those families on a NIMBY basis, despite the fact that there are Travellers living in the area who have been housed for a long time and cause no disturbance.  The usual NIMBY arguments often do not stand up.<\/p>  <p>  Above any group in society, Travellers would be the group most affected by the Bill and if anyone is really serious about dealing with this issue he or she should make a suggestion to the Minister.  For many years we have relied on local authorities under Part 8 to vote for Traveller-specific houses.  Many local authorities, including Galway City Council, have failed to grasp the nettle year after year.  Galway City Council is in flagrant contravention of planning in Galway County Council's area.  Despite the ruling from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it will not grasp the nettle.  I suggest that we stop leaving the decision on Part 8 planning for Traveller-specific housing to local authorities.  Local authorities can make the plan for Traveller-specific housing in the normal way but related planning applications would be referred directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which would have to take cognisance of the plan when considering any planning application and would allow for people to make objections in the usual way for a critical infrastructure process.

Many young people with children are presenting for social housing and in some instances they are being driven out of their home by certain circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  As a member of a local authority I was accused many times of dealing in the micro rather than the macro but I wish to deal with the micro and I will offer some practical solutions that might help to address homelessness.  Currently, people who are in council houses are rightly obliged to advise the council of the occupancy of their house and that occupancy dictates the amount of rent paid.  The living alone allowance is a vital source of income for many households together with the fuel allowance.  Surely, during this crisis, and until such time as the Government gets to grips with the situation, a relaxation of the scheme would be allowed to operate to incentivise families to provide accommodation for relatives or friends in need.  Figures have been touted of up to &euro;1,500 being provided to HAP clients where housing is made available to accommodate a family unit and a lot more than that in the Dublin region.  Surely a worthwhile scheme would be to offer genuine households an additional income of, for example, &euro;500 that would be untaxed for making rooms in their home available until we get to grips with this problem.<\/p>  <p>  I asked a question last year about the number of people and the number of approved housing bodies.  The response was that there are 547 housing bodies with 6,500 staff.  Surely, if some of those staff were relocated back to local authorities to do the job they need to do, we would be able to solve some of the problems.  I am very conscious of the fact that I seem to be always allowed in last.  Last but not least I wish to refer to half acre sites that have been abandoned in rural areas.  Consideration should be given by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to allowing some form of septic tank on them as that would bring back a considerable number of small housing units in the countryside of which people would be delighted to avail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200035#NN00500","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1511365500,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with my two colleagues, Deputy Dessie Ellis and Deputy David Cullinane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200035#NN00600","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1511365500,"counter":384,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It is very simple and it is very reasonable because it is not looking to outlaw these devices; it is just placing a requirement on businesses or public bodies who would seek to put them on their premises to justify that through planning permission and to allow the rest of us to engage in that process.  The Bill comes down to something very simple.  If one thinks it is wrong for public or private property owners to put spikes on the ground or sprinklers under their doorways to stop homelessness, then one supports the Bill.  If one in any thinks that it is justifiable, legitimate or appropriate, then one opposes the Bill.  It really is that simple.<\/p>  <p>  This is not an argument to support rough sleeping.  Contrary to what the Minister said it is not an argument to normalise rough sleeping but it is an argument against the further stigmatisation of people who, because of the failure of the State to provide adequate emergency accommodation, have no choice but to sleep rough.<\/p>  <p>  It is also an argument for common decency.  I listened very carefully to my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and I accept the sincerity of their remarks in terms of crime and the right of people to protect their property.  However, there is nothing in the Bill that would prevent anybody anywhere from doing anything to protect his or her residential or commercial property because the specific devices we are talking about are spikes that go along the ground underneath a shelter at the front of a building or a sprinkler under such places.  They are of no use to protect the properties the Deputies so rightly say are being affected by crime in rural and urban areas.

It is disingenuous of the Deputy to suggest otherwise.<\/p>  <p>  Contrary to the claims of some people, no one chooses to sleep rough.  I am pleased no one has made that claim in the Chamber today.  However, sometimes in the public debate about homelessness we hear that people turn down emergency accommodation and choose to sleep outside.  I work with some people who are rough sleepers.  They tell us they are too fearful to go into emergency accommodation, especially dormitory-style emergency accommodation, because of the fear of theft and violence as well as the fear of being in proximity to drug use when they are going through detoxification.  On these grounds, the decision to sleep rough is not a choice.  These people simply believe they have no other option because of the failure of the State to provide either adequate emergency accommodation or any emergency accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  In some of the locations where rough sleepers tragically died recently outside Dublin no emergency accommodation of any kind was available, whether adequate or otherwise.  Those people did not choose to sleep rough.  The absence of a safe and secure emergency response or a better permanent response was the cause of their difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  It is appropriate to debate the matter today because three sets of figures have come out between today and yesterday.  These figures are bad news on the homeless front.  Other Deputies have already referenced the Dublin Region Homeless Executive figures for rough sleepers, which are disturbing.  We have seen the Department's figures on emergency accommodation as well.  I do not have time to go into the details now but I do not accept the Minister's interpretation of the figures as stabilising.  A great deal is going on behind these figures.  Yesterday, South Dublin County Council published its quarterly homeless figures report, produced by the strategic policy committee.  Alarmingly, not only did the report show a significant increase in the number of people in emergency accommodation &ndash; the figures do not record children separately - but it also gave us figures for the number of presenters.  The number of repeat presenters is especially alarming as is the frequency of repeat presenters at the emergency accommodation desk at South Dublin County Council.  This confirms what we are hearing anecdotally, in other words, large numbers of families are presenting as homeless and there is no emergency accommodation for them.  These families must present repeatedly throughout the month.  In other cases, they may get into homeless accommodation in a hotel.  Then they are put out because of the commercial decision of the landlord.  Consequently, they are forced back into the system.  What the Minister sees as stabilisation has more to do with the absence of adequate emergency accommodation.  Families who have an emergency need are being pushed away from the emergency system and have to continue to repeat-present.  If we had similar figures for the other Dublin local authorities, we would see the same pattern.<\/p>  <p>  I have no wish to take any time from my colleagues.  I fully support the Bill.  If Deputies are against the spikes on the ground and the sprinklers under the shelter that further undermine the dignity of people who are forced to sleep rough, then they should support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200036#OO00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1511366100,"counter":390,"content":"<p>My colleague was diplomatic in responding to the Fianna F&aacute;il contributions.  I will not be as diplomatic because I believe some of them were rather cynical.  It seems there was almost a competition among some of the colleagues to see who would come up with the best excuse not to support the Bill.  An Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v won hands-down with his cynical remarks to the effect that there was some correlation between accommodation for Travellers and this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  This is a practical Bill.  No one on the side of those who proposed the Bill - I heard them speak earlier - presented it as a panacea for the housing crisis.  Of course it is not.  Everyone in the House has put forward practical proposals to Government.  In fact, I said to the Minister the last time we spoke on housing in the Chamber that not a week goes by when we are not in the Chamber challenging the Minister and his Government on the housing crisis.  Not a week or a month goes by when the housing crisis does not get worse.  Yet, solutions are available for the Government.  The problem is that the Government is simply not implementing them.<\/p>  <p>  I have already had a discussion with the Minister about the all-party Oireachtas report, which was supported by all parties in the House.  The Government is not even implementing the recommendations in that report.  We would go further, but if the Government implemented the recommendations across a range of areas in that report, especially in respect of the number of new builds &ndash; the recommended number is 10,000 per year - it would solve many of the problems.  This Bill deals with one problem and one problem only.  Some businesspeople and some who own premises are using devices such as spikes and sprinklers to prevent people from sleeping homeless.  The spikes are dangerous generally.  I have seen them in many different parts of Dublin in particular.  I do not understand how anyone could see them as anti-loitering devices.  They are dangerous.  They should be regulated and the Bill is perfectly reasonable in this regard.  It simply proposes that before any businessperson or anyone else can erect sprinklers, bars or spikes, they should seek planning permission.  That is all the Bill seeks to do.  It is one practical proposal to deal with one element of how we support those who are homeless.<\/p>  <p>  Those of us who support the Bill absolutely understand that more accommodation is necessary.  We also need more supports and shelters for those who are homeless and all the other practical solutions which, unfortunately, the Government has not put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200036#OO00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1511366100,"counter":391,"content":"<p>There is no more open expression of hostility to some of our most vulnerable and deprived citizens than the appalling use of anti-homeless spikes.  The cynical term describing these inhuman barbs is \"defensive architecture\".  With whom do these people think they are at war?  What are they defending against?  The city belongs to everyone as does the space within it.  There are some positive controls, including traffic lights, to alert people to various dangers.  There are acceptable barriers and rails in place for our safety and to stop people wandering into cars and buses.  There are benches in the parks and picnic tables.  These are inviting features and offer people a chance to rest and a place to bring their families.  However, metal spikes in doorways and on ledges clearly make a hostile and aggressive statement.  They suggest the owners do not want that sort of person there.  They suggest such people are not as good as the rest of us and are somehow lesser beings.  These are ugly statements to make to those who are destitute and homeless through no fault of their own.  They represent the antithesis of Ireland of the welcomes.  There is no c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte for the homeless here.  These features are not defensive architecture but abusive architecture.  They do nothing to address the problem of homelessness; they force the problem to go somewhere else.  The idea is that out of sight is out of mind.  God forbid someone working in a big bank might have to look at a homeless person.  Such anti-homeless devices are a direct assault on the homeless and on our humanity and dignity.  They blame the victims for their plight.  They divide us into the haves and the have-nots.  This is not how I want us to be defined.  This is not how I want our city and country to be defined.  I have no wish for the problem of homelessness to be brushed under the carpet.  I have no wish for the homeless to be labelled as some sort of untouchable caste.  I want the homeless to be treated with dignity, respect and humanity.<\/p>  <p>  For many years, mention of social housing by councillors or deputies from the bigger parties was always frowned upon.  This has led to the situation now facing communities.  The idea has been filtered down over the years that social housing and homelessness are bad and that the people affected will cause us problems.  That is nonsense.  We built social housing estates in the 1960s and 1970s in large numbers.  The biggest problem was that we did not put the facilities in place.

It is important to support the Bill, which seeks to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to express my disappointment at the number of rough sleepers in our streets today.  The Government has done little to fix the current housing crisis.  It is now more than 15 months since A Programme for a Partnership Government was introduced.  In the programme, the Government dedicated a whole section on ending the housing shortage and homelessness.  Yet, today Dublin Regional Housing Executive published figures, including the figure of 184 rough sleepers in the city on the night of 7 November last.  That was the highest this figure has been since the official count began more than ten years ago.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot see any substantial efforts being made to fulfil the promise of ending homelessness.  I cannot see any actions being carried out to reduce it by the Government.<\/p><p> In the first place, it is shameful that families are moving around our towns and cities, sleeping in doorways and under windowsills as they seek to find shelter from the weather.  What is much more shameful are the barriers, spikes and water sprinklers put in place by property owners to stop homeless people from gaining shelter.  These are truly inhumane measures that should not be allowed.<\/p> <p> Every week, new motions from all elements of the Opposition are introduced in an effort to tackle the housing crisis but we have seen little action on the Government side.  Recent figures show that 1,442 families are homeless, an increase of 25% since this time last year.  While I appreciate that the housing crisis will take a long time to fix, we have heard much talk but seen no action on housing shortages in my constituency of Cork South-West.  Every day of the week, constituents on the verge of homelessness call to my office and visit my clinics.  Many are sleeping in the homes of family members and plead with me to find them a house.  The sad reality is that no houses are being built to meet demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200036#OO00700","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511366700,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I received a telephone call today from a young man who expects and fears that he will be made homeless before Christmas.

All Deputies are dealing with homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  The motion is different from previous motions on homelessness in that it refers to the use of sprinkler systems and spikes.  I have not seen these measures being used and I do not believe they are in use anywhere in County Kerry.  Some people will choose to sleep rough because they are afraid to use hostels or places of refuge for various reasons, for example, the ready availability of drink or drugs, but I sometimes wonder if there are others who would not take any place to sleep to get them off the streets.  I may be wrong in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  While Kerry County Council is proactive in providing housing and emergency accommodation, it appears to have stopped providing demountable homes.  Planning permission is now required for this type of home.  That was not always the case because I remember once when a family home caught fire that the council provided two demountable homes the following day.  The large family concerned were living in these homes in their own yard the following evening.  Why have local authorities stopped providing demountable homes?  I am sure many local authorities have land on which they could provide such accommodation on an emergency basis to give families and single persons a place to sleep.  At least they would be dry and would be looked after in some way, rather than being worried, as the couple who telephoned me today are, that they will be homeless before Christmas.  The family in question has land but the local authority will not accede to my request to provide them with a demountable temporary home.  I do not know the reason for its refusal to do so but I will try to find out again tomorrow.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister stated that money is not an obstacle.  While demountable homes are a little expensive, they are an option that is not being explored. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200037#PP00200","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1511366700,"counter":395,"content":"<p>In case anything I say could be construed as a conflict of interest, I should declare that I have an interest in this matter.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment the staff of Kerry County Council's homelessness unit on the excellent work they do.

They do their best with what they have but the trouble is that private and council accommodation is extremely scarce.<\/p>  <p>  When plans are being made to address the accommodation crisis, I insist that all persons in rented accommodation have their own bathroom.  The requirement to have a shower, toilet and so forth is sacrosanct.  However, people give the impression that bedsits are awful places to live.  If a bedsit is nice and provides proper space, there is nothing wrong with it.  Years ago, people from Kerry moved to Dublin and spent years in bedsits until they were able to get on the housing ladder and buy a home.  They were glad to have affordable accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the recent television programme which showed people living in cramped conditions.  These outrageous conditions should not be tolerated.  However, there is nothing wrong with living in a bedsit.  I ask the Government to consider this issue because bedsit accommodation is a sensible way of dealing with circumstances in which there simply are not enough places to live.<\/p>  <p>  Every village has empty houses.  A system should be introduced to incentivise and encourage people to provide accommodation in empty units.  While I acknowledge the Government is moving in this direction, we must make progress on this issue and try to have vacant dwellings turned into places where people can live safely, happily and with dignity.  All we want is fair play.<\/p>  <p>  The argument is made that accommodation must be big.  There is nothing wrong with small accommodation, especially for single people, provided it is nice, clean and has been done up.

It is sickening and in no small way ironic that the House should debate this motion on a day when homeless statistics were published showing that the problem is not being solved.  This will not come as a surprise to most people.<\/p><p>Increasingly, Departments and business premises are taking measures to prevent homeless people from finding some semblance of shelter when they cannot secure a hostel place.  Some may not feel safe using a hostel, which is very much an issue.  Those of us who woke up during the night to the sound of torrential rain will not have been surprised by reports of flooding this morning and will find it hard to reconcile this with people being denied the possibility of finding a degree of shelter outdoors last night.  While I sympathise with some small business owners who have health and safety concerns and must try to open their premises every morning, I find it hard to accept the practice by which Departments erect inhumane structures to prevent people from finding shelter, particularly given that the growth in homelessness is very much a failure of successive Governments.<\/p><p>The issue is not the barriers <i>per se<\/i>, although I find them offensive and they make matters worse, but the need to deal with cases where people do not have a roof over their heads.  My office is in Agriculture House.  The side of the building could provide a decent shelter, although I certainly would not like to spend the night sleeping under it.  However, a structure has been erected specifically to deter people who had previously used it as a shelter at night from continuing to do so. <\/p><p>Deputy Paul Murphy noted that Fr. Peter McVerry said dignity is the first thing that is lost.  This is compounded by virtue of the fact that people who do not have a place to sleep, to wash, to go the loo or to eat are being told, by means of a physical structure, that they are not wanted even in an outdoor environment.  When one gets the No. 66 bus to come into town and sits upstairs, one cannot but see tents in the Phoenix Park.  None of us would have ever expected that we would have got to this stage.  While rough sleeping is something people undoubtedly understood as homelessness, there is a whole range of other types of homelessness as well.  It is deviating a little from the Bill but I refer to split families and several families often living under the same roof.  I remember the housing rights campaign in the 1970s of one family, one home.  It is shocking to think that in 2017, we are further away from what was aspired to at that time.<\/p> <p> The homeless figures released today show there are 5,298 adults and 3,194 children who are homeless.  I never thought I would see a child who was homeless.  The first time I encountered a child who was homeless and sleeping in a car was five or six years ago.  I remember coming in here and speaking about it.  I was horrified at the idea.  We have stopped being horrified.  We talk about numbers.  That sense of outrage must be the driving force, for example, for Government.  The language that has been used in comparing Ireland with other countries has diminished that sense of outrage we should rightly have.  It is not normal.  It should not be normal.  It is not acceptable.  It is particularly offensive for Departments, in particular, to erect barriers when they are part of the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200037#PP00400","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511367300,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Gino Kenny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200038#QQ00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1511367300,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

However, I will start by commenting on the information that has been provided to us and to the country today on the number of rough sleepers in this city.  We are told there were 134 such rough sleepers six months ago and that on the night of the count in October, that figure had increased to 184.  Moreover, if one includes the 50 people who stayed that night in Merchant's Quay, there were 234 people who could not be accommodated elsewhere.  That is a shocking figure.  It is not a small marginal increase.  It is not an increase that has happened over a period of years.  It is an increase of more than one third in the space of six months on the Minister's watch.  It leaves a bitter taste in my mouth to listen to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, come in here and state, it is \"beginning to look like it [homelessness] is stabilising in Dublin\" on the day that those figures are released.  This is a shocking failure on the Minister of State, Deputy English's, part and on the part of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister tried to recruit the Fr. Peter McVerry Trust as an ally in making the case against this Bill stating that the Fr. Peter McVerry Trust is for Housing First and is for providing homes instead of this approach.  Fr. Peter McVerry supports this Bill.  He participated in a press conference with us yesterday in support of this Bill.  The other homeless charities also support this Bill.  Let us have a little bit less of the political football from the Minister in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  In arguing against the Bill in the media during the week, a Government source incredibly stated, \"We do not want to enable people to stay on the street, we want to enable them to find a home.\"  That is not an argument against this Bill.  A homeless person who goes tonight to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection office in Gandon House, across from Connolly Station, but who cannot sleep on a bench underneath a shelter because there are iron bars all along the line, will not get up and walk into a house because the Government has failed to provide housing or even a roof over that person's head.  Instead, he or she will go somewhere else.  If the person cannot get a place in such a building, he or she will go to a darker and quieter place, and the Minister of State knows where that leads to.  There have been years of anti-homelessness laws in the United States and they show us where this leads to, if this policy continues.  There were hearings recently in the State of Colorado about the anti-homelessness laws.  They heard about the homeless man, who could not sleep outside a building, who went to sleep down a dark lane and was run over and killed by a car.  They heard from five different women who had gone to sleep in dark quieter places and had been raped in those places.  This is a criminal type of policy that the Minister of State, Deputy English, is defending with these anti-homeless devices.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il, in the course of the debate, made points about rural crime.  It is a complete red herring.  The idea that people will put sprinkler systems up outside their homes to stop the homes from being robbed is nonsense, as is the idea that iron bars on benches outside of buildings will stop burglars.  They would be stopped from what, from having a fag after the deed has been done?  The point is Fianna F&aacute;il knows that it is nonsense.  I will not go into it in any great detail.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting that we did not see an appearance in this debate from the Independent Alliance.  It is a busy day for them - the tickets to North Korea are officially being cancelled today.  On the silence from the Independent Alliance, I would have liked to have seen the socialist Minister, Deputy Finian McGrath, or the socialist Minister, Deputy Halligan, come in here, look me in the eye and justify voting against a Bill that would ban sprinkler systems dousing homeless people with cold water on a cold November night.<\/p>  <p>  I will save my final word for the Fine Gael Members of the House, many of whom say that they were inspired to come into politics by the ideas of the \"Towards a Just Society\" document that was produced in the 1960s.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, cannot defend the idea of a just society and oppose a Bill that would make it easier to stop spikes, iron bars and sprinkler systems being used against those who the Government's policies have denied even having a roof over their heads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200038#QQ00400","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1511367300,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Obviously, I support the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  This is a symptom of how society deals with people who find themselves homeless, not because they choose to be homeless but because society makes them homeless.

They were completely crass and insensitive to people who find themselves in a crisis of homelessness.  As I said in last week's debate, it is almost like social whitewashing of homelessness, such is the level of debate on the matter.  <\/p> <p> The devices to which this Bill refers are completely crude and dehumanising.  The term for them is \"defensive architecture\", which is quite incredible.  This is even worse than the term \"gated communities\".  The message is \"stay away, don't come here\".  There are other cities across the world where the situation is similar to that in Dublin but they try to cater, aesthetically for want of a better word, for people who find themselves homeless.  I was in Lisbon last year where I discovered that lockers are provided for people who find themselves homeless.  Homeless people are provided with lockers to store possessions such as clothes and blankets.  I am not saying that is normal.  It is abnormal but in a society where homelessness is prevalent, it is a good thing.  <\/p> <p> These devices are completely alien in a civilised society.  Any business that erects such devices should be boycotted.  It would be a good thing if the Government tried to eradicate homelessness, although I do not think it is capable of doing so.  I do not mean that personally in respect of the Minister of State.  I do not think Fine Gael is capable of doing it because it is ideologically wedded to a market system and it believes that homelessness is acceptable in a market economy.  As long as that belief system prevails, we will always have homelessness.  We need to change the system.  There are 8,000 people in emergency accommodation, which is a disgrace.  There are 190 people homeless in this city today, which is also a disgrace.  <\/p> <p> I urge the Minister of State to support this Bill.  While it is largely cosmetic it will send out a message that this is not acceptable and that homelessness is not acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200038#QQ00500","speaker":"1299","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511367900,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to address the House on this matter.  It is very important that we are here again, discussing housing and homelessness for possibly the seventh or eighth week in a row.  That is where the focus has been for everybody in here.  It is our number one priority and as I said last week, it is wrong to argue otherwise.  Week in and week out, everyone in this D&aacute;il chooses to make this the number one issue and that is right.<\/p>  <p>  We have today's figures, which the Government published.  We count them and put them out there.  Nobody is trying to hide from these figures.  We admit that they are not acceptable and Deputy Gino Kenny is absolutely right in that regard.  Regardless of ideology, nobody would accept homelessness as normal or want to accept it as thus.  I acknowledge Deputy Kenny was not referring to me personally but my party does not accept or want that either and neither does any other party in this D&aacute;il.  That is not what we are about.  This House has agreed to spend &euro;6 billion to fund solutions to homelessness and rough sleeping.  There is a commitment there in the form of funding.  <\/p>  <p>  Today I met all of the housing teams from the local authorities to discuss delivery timelines, moving projects forward, trebling our pipeline of projects and so forth.  Deputies Cowen, &Oacute; Broin and others have been saying for months that we need to improve the delivery timelines and so forth.  In my discussions with the housing teams I make it clear that the minimum target in Rebuilding Ireland, which is to reach 10,000 social housing units per year has cross-party support.  Many Deputies in this House want to do more and that is fine but we must have a plan to get there.  However, I make it clear to everyone concerned that there is cross-party support for this.  The Government has announced the amount to be spent but everybody here agrees that it is the least we will do.  I stress to the local authorities that Deputies view them as the number one, front-line bodies to solve this problem.  Local authority housing is key and local authorities, in conjunction with all of the other stakeholders, must drive this.  We want them to do that and every week in the D&aacute;il, Deputies argue that local authorities should do this and the Government agrees.  I stressed to the local authorities, on behalf of everyone in the D&aacute;il, that everyone here supports this.  Some Deputies want them to do more but the money is there and the local authorities must make it happen and put projects in place.  I do not want to bring ideology into this at all because we are all committed to solving this problem and if we are not, we should not be in here.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the discussion on this Bill.  However, it is misplaced and unworkable, albeit well-intended, legislation that will not solve the problem.  The use of these devices is wrong.  I do not agree with these devices, which are not needed.  Their use is not something I would encourage but I do not believe this legislation will solve the problem or even help the situation.  It is not an appropriate response.  We are in this House every week trying to explain what we are doing.  Again this evening we heard some Deputies saying that the Government is doing nothing and that nothing is happening but that is not fair.  It is not fair to all of the people who are working, week in and week out, to improve the situation.  It is not fair to all of the people in the various housing bodies, non-governmental organisations and voluntary groups who are working night after night and week after week, spending fundraised and taxpayers' money trying to help people.  People still come into this Chamber, week after week and say that nothing is being done.  I have no problem saying that not enough is being done but it is wrong to say that nothing is being done.  That does not reflect the work that is being done night after night and week after week.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the debate on this issue and would welcome more solutions to address the problem.  We do not see this legislation as a solution, however.  I accept that these devices are wrong and unnecessary but this legislation will not help rough sleepers or address their issues.  That is what we need to face up to here.  The issues faced by rough sleepers are complex and require nuanced and comprehensive solutions.  A simple change to the planning code is not going to provide that.  Some Deputies argued that the legislation aims to send out a clear message and I can accept the motive behind it.  However, the legislation is unworkable and will simply complicate what we are trying to do, which is to prevent rough sleeping.  We want to be able to help rough sleepers into different housing solutions, whether that is emergency or permanent.  Mention was made of the Housing First option, which works very well in Scandinavian countries, in Canada and elsewhere.  We introduced it here in the last year and it is working quite well.  Approximately 180 people have gone through that system and while that is not nearly enough, it is certainly a solution for some rough sleepers.  The idea is to get them a home first and then to wrap the services around them.  In the past, the approach was to try to get the services in place first before moving rough sleepers into homes.  We are turning that on its head and rightly so.  We are working with the Peter McVerry Trust, Focus Ireland and others to make that happen.  We are using taxpayers' money to make it happen and we want to do more of that.  That is what we should do, along with all of the other solutions.  <\/p>  <p>  I am not convinced that this Bill is going to help.  We are all in agreement that no person should have to sleep on the streets without shelter at any time of the year.  The figures are horrific and there is no denying that.  The latest figures indicate that there are 190 rough sleepers.  I would argue that the core figure of rough sleepers is between 160 and 180, for whom we are trying to provide solutions.  At the same time, there are far too many people living in hotels and other emergency accommodation, numbering approximately 8,500 and we must intervene with different solutions for those people.  <\/p>  <p>  Rough sleeping is an issue that we particularly want to address, which is why the Minister will announce changes to the cold weather initiative.  We will put in place more emergency beds of a permanent nature.  There will be an additional 200 such beds, building on the increased number of emergency beds that were put in place last year.  We want to make sure that we can say, hand on heart, that there is a bed available for every rough sleeper and that such people could engage with the homeless services, although not everyone will want to do that.  We try on a nightly basis, through both formal and informal arrangements, to engage with people and to encourage them to use the system.  I understand that some people are afraid to engage with the services, having had a bad experience in the past.  We are trying to provide a top-class service in all of the new facilities.  While nobody wants to be in emergency accommodation, we are trying to improve the service and the standards therein.  We are also trying to ensure that the existing facilities are improved.  That said, all of these facilities are emergency in nature and are only meant to be temporary.  We need to find permanent solutions and that is what we are trying to do.  By the middle of this year, we had found an emergency solution for more than 2,000 people.  Moreover, more than 600 people who would have been in emergency accommodation in hotels have found homes through various housing schemes.  That is what we have to do to get ahead of the figures.  It will take a bit more time because with roughly 88 homeless presentations per month, the problem is still getting worse.  It is hard to get ahead of the figures.  All of the interventions that were made last year and all of the solutions that were put in place were not enough.  More money will be spent next year on more solutions.  I would be very happy if Deputies would come into this House with more ideas and more solutions that could make a real difference.  Some good ideas have been put forward and we have tried to implement them but I am not hearing any additional magic solutions over and above what we are already doing.  We are committed to building 10,000 social housing units and are doing that.  There have been good proposals in respect of affordable housing and other options and we will do more on that.  However, nobody in here is providing additional solutions week after week.  However, if good suggestions are made that we believe will make a difference, we will try to get them off the ground.  <\/p><p>We will try to do that, genuinely, because the resources are there to do it.<\/p> <p> Deputies Danny and Michael Healy-Rae raised a couple of issues around vacant properties.  I repeat to both Deputies that there are solutions to this issue.  If anyone has a vacant property, we urge them to bring it forward and talk to the local authority.  There are a number of schemes they can avail of to put the properties into use.  I point out to Deputy Breathnach that Louth County Council has been a fine example of how to do this, and when people do not come forward, it can take their properties through other means.  There are many options for people who own properties but cannot afford to get them back into the system.  We will spend money on that and we will make changes to the system to make it a little easier.  There has been a lot of feedback on the repair and lease-back initiative, for example, that it is too complicated, with too much red tape and requiring too long a commitment.  We will make changes to reflect that.  We do change things when we get feedback.<\/p> <p> As I said, the Minister, Deputy Murphy, has announced an extra 200 emergency beds.  They will be up and running during December and all beds will be in place by 18 December.  In addition, other temporary emergency beds are being put in place for when the weather conditions get so bad that the people who do not normally engage with any service come forward.  We have allowed for that and will try to deal with it as well.  It is hoped that will give an opportunity to engage with them on long-term solutions.  I think the Housing First approach is the right option.  We need to do more of that and it is something I hope we roll out a lot more.<\/p> <p> Deputies made the point that local authorities need to lead this and I cannot stress enough that they are leading.  We have put them front and centre.  At this morning's discussion, the head of the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, Michael Walsh, said that in the past local authorities were driving the construction of social housing but they were told seven or eight years ago to stop and just to buy, lease and so on.  He said we have now put them back in the position to do that.  We are giving local authorities increased teams, increased powers and increased finances to be back in the space of leading the challenge to deliver more social housing.  The approved housing bodies also do excellent work and I have asked local authorities and councillors to strengthen their relationships with them.  Any proposed solution that comes through an approved housing body comes through the local authority as well.  The local authority is in charge of that and it says yes or no before it comes to us.  Local authorities are at the front of this and I want to reinforce that point, given it was raised in the debate.<\/p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised the point about repeat presentations.  We are trying to intervene where, for whatever reason, people end up in a property or housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and it does not work out.  In some cases, the landlord withdraws the property, but in others it does not work out for the individual or family that goes into the home.  We try to work with them more closely, perhaps by providing more services in order that they can stay in the house.  For some families who are homeless for a long time or have a very complicated case, a traditional family home is a good way to get back into operating their own home in a secure environment with extra services and then, eventually, move on to a house.  The Deputy is probably raising two different categories but he is focusing on those who were in a rented house or HAP house and it did not work out due to reasons associated with the landlord.  That is something we are trying to deal with.  We have put in increased teams to make sure we do not have people who come back again and have to re-engage.  There is nothing worse than being in a homeless situation and living in a hotel or bed and breakfast, then finding a housing solution only to be back in the same situation six months later.  We try to intervene to prevent that happening.<\/p> <p> There is a pipeline of projects but we have told the local authorities it is not enough and that we want it literally doubled or trebled.  We have asked them to engage in a new system to make it happen more quickly and they are up for that.  They have done it in the past and they are in that position.  Now we have to make it happen even more quickly.  I am asking all local authorities with their councillors to get involved with us on the new timelines and the Part 8 process to make this happen.  Again, we have stressed that the local authority management should engage much more with councillors and the community to get acceptance for projects at a much earlier stage.  The issue of Traveller accommodation was raised and it is one on which are trying to focus, with changes, to make sure we get that money spent, as well as increasing the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200039#RR00200","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511368500,"counter":405,"content":"<p>The last time I debated with the Minister of State in the House, he made the astounding statement about our international reputation on homelessness.

They are not counted, by the way, in the Department's official homelessness report of October 2017, which counts only those availing of private supported or temporary emergency accommodation.  Therefore, the homeless figures are obviously limited.  In Dublin, there are 3,536 adults homeless and, nationally, it is 5,298, with 3,194 dependants, generally children.  Obviously, we have the numbers on the housing list.  As Peter McVerry, whom the Minister of State's colleague tried to use as a \"partner\", said, this does not include sofa surfing, people in massive overcrowding or those staying with family, given we have many parents with two children in rooms with their grandchildren or people in completely insecure and unaffordable accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The fact these anti-homeless voices are being led by State agencies is particularly shocking, and this includes Waterways Ireland which should be condemned for what it is doing.  The Government should issue an instruction tomorrow that it desist from doing that.  The Government has obviously stopped counting deaths but 345 people have died on the streets from 2005 to 2015, and the number of males in particular has sharply increased.<\/p>  <p>  This is a serious problem of on-street homelessness but it is all interrelated.  It is related to the people who are in emergency accommodation, to the people on the housing list and also to the people Fine Gael claims to represent, the people who are struggling to pay mortgages and rents.  It is all interrelated.  The Minister of State asked for a solution.  It is not a mystery.  We do not need to go searching for solutions and we do not need special committees.  The solution is very simple.  It is public lands and public homes.  Yesterday it was revealed on RT&Eacute; by a planner, Mel Reynolds, that local authorities have 12,000 hectares of land that could provide at least 38,000 homes.  That is not to mention NAMA or other State agencies, just the councils themselves.  The lands are already zoned and serviced, yet Dublin City Council last year built 56 public homes and my own council, Fingal County Council, built ten.  Why, when the resources are sitting there, are they not being deployed?<\/p>  <p>  This brings home the fact there is an ideological issue.  It is not, as the Minister said, that the Government does not want mono-tenure estates.  It is because there has been a change in policy in recent decades.  In the 1970s, some 8,000 to 9,000 public homes were built by local authorities routinely but that is now gone.  Neoliberalism has reigned for the past 20 to 25 years in particular.  That particular Thatcherite philosophy says no society exists.  It slashes public housing and demonises those in local authority and public housing.  The unfortunate thing for ordinary people is that the private sector is on strike.  Land is being hoarded, as we know, and there is no willingness on the part of private developers to build until prices rise even more.<\/p><p>Those prices are rising relentlessly.  As my colleague showed at the start of the debate, this is working very well for a small number of people.<\/p> <p> Before I continue, I will briefly give examples of what could be done to address opposition to the Bill.  One of the reasons cited for opposing it is the possibility of unintended consequences, for example, squatter's rights, but someone needs to have stayed somewhere for 12 years to get those.  The excuses have actually been funny, particularly Fianna F&aacute;il's.  We have heard everything from concern for Travellers to burglars.  They must be the dumbest criminals if they cannot overcome a few spikes and a sprinkler system.  We have heard it all.  Clearly, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have decided that the business class that they ably represent at the best of times should not have to suffer the terrible difficulty of having to apply for planning permission for these devices.<\/p> <p> Of course this Bill is not a solution to the housing crisis.  If the Minister of State recalls, we tabled a Bill last January that could have banned most of the evictions that have since taken place on grounds of, for example, the sale of a property or its refurbishment.  However, the Government turned its back on that.  We have proposed other solutions.  This Bill is designed to highlight the Government's attitude in particular to the homeless.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State asked for solutions and said he never hears of any, but if all of the local authority land that I mentioned was used and planned out and the almost 200,000 vacant units-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200040#SS00400","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511369100,"counter":409,"content":"<p>We will introduce that one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200041#TT00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1511369100,"counter":410,"content":"<p>-----in the country were acquired, everyone would have a house.  That is the solution.<\/p>  <p>  We have a proposal regarding Dublin West, which is the Taoiseach's constituency, and I challenge the Minister of State to support it.  The council has sat on 90 acres of land in the greater Blanchardstown area for a number of years and has not devised a development plan.  We could comfortably build at least 1,100 homes without any high density construction.  They would be a mixture of apartments and houses.  We could create a community with parks, facilities, an outdoor fitness area and a youth centre.  We have called it \"Damastown Village\" and suggested a way to develop it.  It would not be monotenure.  If the Government wants to ban monotenure developments, it should change the local authority rules.  This is simple.  Allow more people into developments.<\/p>  <p>  We are proposing that 50% be affordable housing, with mortgages for the very people who are suffering with large rents that account for as much as half of their incomes in some cases.  The other 50% would be social housing for homeless people in the area and those who had been on the social housing list for many years.<\/p>  <p>  We had an architect draw up plans, which Fingal County Council did not bother to do in recent years despite the homelessness crisis in the area escalating.  We can pass these plans on to the Minister of State.<\/p>  <p>  The cost would be approximately &euro;170 million.  The Government claims that money is no object and the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, stated that there was no shortage of money.  Approximately half of that amount - &euro;87 million - would be paid for by the affordable mortgage aspect and accrue profit of in or around &euro;15 million over the 25 years of those mortgages, allowing money to be paid for community centres and community infrastructure.  The other half would require Fingal County Council to use its capital budget, borrow &euro;10 million from the Housing Finance Agency and receive an injection of &euro;48 million from the Department.  This is not a major request, given that 35% of the homelessness problem in Dublin is located in Fingal County Council's area despite it only having 22% of the homeless population.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Minister of State prepared to support something like this or does he want working people to travel up the road to Hansfield where McGarrell Reilly, which was named in the Paradise Papers, is selling houses for &euro;315,000, which the Taoiseach believes is affordable?  Houses in Damastown could be sold for approximately &euro;170,000.  It is being done in Ballymun, which shows that it can be done in Damastown.  Why is it not being done?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State claims the Government does not need cross-party support, but it will get none from us anyway because there is an ideological divide.  There are parties like Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour that are committed to, and put all emphasis on, the private market, and then there are other parties that believe in prioritising public need.  Instead of cross-party support, a left alternative must be built and strengthened in this country.  We need a left alternative that would break the EU rules for the common good, commandeer wealth and resources to end the crisis, pass emergency laws to stop evictions and run society, not in the interests of the 1%, the vulture funds and the developers, but in the interests of working class people as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200041#TT00300","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1511369100,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1511369100,"counter":412,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 23 November 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200041#TT00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Finance Bill 2017: Report Stage (Resumed)","time":1511369100,"counter":413,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200041#TT00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1511369100,"counter":414,"content":"<p>T&aacute;imid ag dul ar ais anois go dt&iacute; an Bille Airgeadais 2017.

A few weeks beforehand, a study was published in which revised calculations of methane produced per head of cattle showed that global livestock emissions in 2011 were 11% higher than estimates that were based on data from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, meaning that the figures being used by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine need to be revised and Ireland's standing on climate change action may be even worse than that damning report suggests.<\/p>  <p>  We are doing little to tackle the threat of climate change, our agricultural and transport sectors being the major culprits.  We are increasing the beef and dairy herd even though we know that they are the most climate destructive and carbon and water intensive forms of food production on the planet.  To stop being the worst performer on climate change in Europe, we need to face a few hard facts.  As Mr. Ian Lumley of An Taisce pointed out at the Bonn climate change conference last week, global animal agriculture needs an exit strategy.  We have got to change our approach.  He stated that, if the target in the Paris Agreement is to be met, that exit strategy should be as rapid as necessary for coal, oil and gas.  In that spirit, we need to get oil, coal and gas out of our transport sector as fast as possible.<\/p><p>We need to consider increasing benefit-in-kind for those who purchase electric cars through work, and I have recommended a period of five years.  The Minister might say that is off the Richter scale, but it would not be a mad expense.  I do not have figures, but it is something worth considering.  As the Minister knows, I am seeking a review.  I am not saying this has to happen now, otherwise my amendment would have been ruled out of order because I would have transgressed the money message rule.<\/p> <p> Assessing whether this is value-for-money cannot be a bad idea.  It is not a mad notion for me to come up with.  If we are serious about electric cars, we also have to get serious about how we produce electricity.  Unfortunately, we are not the cleanest producers of electricity around.  In fact, if one was to compare us with western European countries I doubt any would be in as poor a place as we are.  The burning of coal in Moneypoint should stop.  The State should borrow in order to provide massive investment in solar, wind and water renewable power.  Much like the housing crisis, the private sector will not fill that gap.  The State has a significant responsibility to come up to the plate and it can do so.<\/p> <p> We know we do not have an endless supply of money, but the State has to play a stronger role in tackling climate change.  Everyone has seen their electricity prices rise of late, as the PSO levy has increased.  We have been told this is to help to pay for new renewable projects, but in reality we are subsidising the highly inefficient and destructive burning of peat at power stations while we convert them to biomass, another climate disaster in the making.  Future generations will thank us if we play a positive role now and deal with these issues.<\/p> <p> The Minister has probably heard what people in the industry have said about going from one to five years.  Alan Nolan, the director general of The Society of the Irish Motor Industry, welcomed the move to promote electric cars in the first place, but said it is so limited in scope that it will have very little impact given that most companies buy vehicles over three-year periods.  He went on to say that if it really wants to make an impact, any such scheme needs to relate to the buying cycle.  I can assure the Minister that when I was buying commercial vehicles we worked on a five year cycle because it made more financial sense to do so.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister to consider the measure urgently.  I do not think it is a mad idea.  God knows there have been plenty of mad ideas in this place.  It is to be hoped that the Minister will see fit to at least agree to a review after about six months or whatever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200041#TT01400","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511369700,"counter":423,"content":"<p>We discussed this to some extent on Committee Stage.

He should formalise that in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, said the exemption would be in place for three years.  That is not what the Finance Bill, as currently constructed, actually states.  The Minister might clarify the Government's policy, as well as from the point of view of employees.

I had a discussion today with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, about the fact that every single one of the many buses we purchased over the past six years is powered by diesel .  There is a significant movement away from diesel right across Europe.  Several European cities will have no public transport diesel by 2025.<\/p>  <p>  We have all bought things which we cannot throw away.

I wanted to equalise the tax on diesel and petrol in order to encourage people to move further away from diesel.  I understand there are issues around that, such as the commercial use of diesel, and there is a body of work to be done to make sure businesses are not crucified.  However, there has to be a genuine move away from diesel in the direction of renewable energy.  It is to be hoped that will happen.

In looking at the potential uncertainty and difficulty that we may need to manage in the coming period with respect to haulage and access into and out of our country, I decided this budget was not the time to change the tax treatment of diesel.

It is a feature of both Committee and Report Stage amendments that reports are called for to get information.  If the Department was better organised, frankly, it would not be contentious and it would form the basis of people being able to make intelligent decisions.  I confess to being one of those mostly women who some years ago switched to a diesel car because I believed all the propaganda I read.  One might say somebody involved with politics should be very alert to propaganda but I really believed it.  It is a particular concern for the Minister in his constituency, for me in my constituency and probably for Deputy Michael McGrath in his constituency in Cork that all the international evidence indicates the level of pollution and particulates from diesel cars is far higher than has been appreciated.  The health consequences, particularly for young and vulnerable people living near busy traffic routes, are very severe and ultimately could be very costly to the Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  The data and information about diesel were not available until the various scandals, particularly involving Volkswagen and so on, which emerged in the United States when tests were faked.  It is a second reason to support this, particularly for any of us who represent urban constituencies with dense concentrations of traffic.  Many of the drivers in the traffic, like me, bought diesel cars thinking they were better for the environment.  That was four or five years ago.  I am not somebody who would trade in a car very frequently but a strong case can be made for a financial incentive in this respect.  A former Minister, Mr. Ruair&iacute; Quinn, did this in the past for what might be called clapped out vehicles over ten years old.  There was a subsidy to have them replaced and get the bangers off the road.  It worked very well at the time.  There is a role, with regard to consumer and business behaviour, in providing such subsidies.<\/p>  <p>  Our carbon record is desperate and that is a primary reason for doing some of this.  We really are bottom of the class with regard to carbon emissions.  Internationally, that is put down to our cattle and it is associated with our name.  Significantly, we can act in this respect for health reasons.  The Minister and I live near a children's hospital and we know asthma rates, for example, are very high in Ireland.

This was provided for in the Finance Act 2016.  This will fall to 37% from 1 January 2018 and by a further 2% each year until 2020 when it will be 33%.  It is a final liability tax, that is, it satisfies the individual's full liability to income tax in respect of deposit interest.  The individual may still be liable to PRSI on the interest.  Deposit interest subject to DIRT is not subject to the universal social charge.  It is estimated that as the overall cost of each 2% reduction in the rate of DIRT is approximately &euro;6.4 million in a full year, the total annual full-year cost over the three remaining years is estimated at &euro;19.2 million by the time the full reduction is in effect in 2020.  <\/p> <p> I am aware that prior to the enactment of the Finance Act 2016, the rates payable on a series of other taxes, including taxes on life assurance policies, have tended to move in line with DIRT.  However, on that occasion, my predecessor decided not to reduce those other rates.  The decision was made due to the annual cost of reducing the rates of these other taxes by 2% being tentatively estimated by the Revenue Commissioners to be, allowing for rounding, &euro;14 million annually with tax and life assurance products alone accounting for &euro;11 million.

It therefore remains too costly to the Exchequer to reduce the rates of these taxes in the same manner as the ongoing series of reductions in the rate of DIRT.  <\/p> <p> This summer, the tax strategy group examined the matter of taxation of investment products.  The tax strategy group examined options for changing and amending that taxation.  It set out some options in this regard but constrained financial resources meant that it was not possible for me to act on them in this year's budget or Finance Bill.  During work on that paper, and following advice from Revenue, it became evident that there were more complex issues to be addressed, in the context of the tax regime that applies to personal investment products other than those covered by DIRT, than simply the degree of the rates of tax applied and it was soon determined that a more holistic approach might be required.  I therefore propose to establish a working group of officials from my Department and Revenue to examine and address the variety and complexity of the operation and taxation of personal investment products including the interaction of these regimes.  An examination of the matters set out in the Deputy's proposed amendment will form part of the group's work.  It will take longer than the three months suggested in the amendment for the group to carry out its work on such complex issues in a thorough and complete manner.  I will instruct the group to provide me with a co-ordinated form of proposals prior to budget 2019, allowing sufficient time for those proposals to be acted on if necessary.<\/p> <p> The resource argument was particularly important in my decision.  If one looks at the cost for this year of this decision on DIRT, and the cost of continuing the decision of the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, it was &euro;6.4 million in a full year.  The costs in respect of similar decisions on other investment products would have been &euro;28 million for next year, rising to &euro;56 million by 2020.  Given the cost involved in the decision, I decided I would not include it in the budget.  I will go ahead with the working group, which will tease out different policy issues on the matter to be presented to me in advance of next year.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200045#XX00900","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511372100,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

The reality is that people earn little or nothing on their savings.  The effect of having this differential between the DIRT on traditional savings and deposit accounts and the exit tax rate on longer-term products is that it incentivises people to put money into traditional banks, savings and deposit accounts where they are currently earning little or nothing, where other products tend to be longer-term in nature.

Presumably it will take some time to do its work.<\/p>  <p>  Charges on savings products including life assurance are very high in Ireland.  Early on in my time as Minister for Social Protection, I commissioned a study on costs of investment products in respect of people saving for pensions.  Compared with other European countries, our costs can be very high.  That is something the review group could look at.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Michael McGrath that savers, many of whom are saving from pension lump sums, find it extremely difficult to get any decent return.  My view and that of the Labour Party is that there should be a product available either through An Post or through the National Treasury Management Agency, which could be a savings bond, for instance.  The ideal candidate for the use of a savings bond fund would be housing.  I envisage it would permit people to save up to a certain amount, would allow many people to save, especially those on lower incomes, and could be used to invest in housing.  It could pay modestly above the current rates of return.  For many people who are trying to save for their retirement, interest rates in the Irish market make it almost impossible for them to get any return worth talking about.  It is important that the Minister for Finance should facilitate people, especially smaller savers, to do so to facilitate their comfort in retirement and that they can accumulate savings that keep their value.  As I am sure the Minister is aware, many savings have a negative return in real terms, perhaps not hugely so but negative nonetheless.<\/p>  <p>  The focus, in finance terms, has been on restoring the pillar banks.  As such, interest rates are low and interest charges are high and we do not have the kinds of products that are available in other countries, especially for smaller savers who would not be in a position to pay the fees on other products and who, because of their age are understandably risk-averse.  They need deposit-type structures or something very close to that.  The review group is a good idea in the context of the economy recovering.  It would be good if it was in a position to address those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200046#YY00400","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1511372100,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I will give an example of the complexity to which I referred earlier.

In terms of some life assurance products, we also have a 41% exit tax rate over an eight year disposal window.

For a single person, a widowed person or a surviving civil partner, it is &euro;18,000.  For a married couple or a couple in a civil partnership, it is &euro;36,000.  Those figures have not changed for some years.  People have made the point to me and, I am sure, to other Deputies that the value of those exemption limits is eroded over time if they are not changed.  I recognise that the priority in this budget was the reduction in the universal social charge and the raising of the entry point to the higher rate of tax.  However, this is one issue where the non-indexation of the tax system has a direct consequence.  While, on the face of it, people might think those exemption limits are generous, the State contributory and non-contributory pensions are taxable.  Therefore, if a person has other income such as a private occupational pension, even of a modest amount, that can be taxable income and the person may have a tax liability.  For those whose incomes are marginally in excess of the current exemption limits, there is the option of paying tax at a rate of 40%.  This is known as marginal relief.  However, it is somewhat complicated because the point at which the marginal relief ceases to be of benefit varies depending on the circumstances and the tax credits that apply.  As a practitioner of constituency politics, people come to me with tax issues and so on and, obviously, I advise them to get professional taxation advice.

The purpose of the exemption is to identify an income threshold below which a taxpayer aged 65 or over is not required to pay income tax or to submit claims to Revenue for income tax reliefs.  This exemption limit does not equate to the amount of income which would be sheltered by the tax credits available to the individual or couple as both the exemption limit and the tax credit available can vary depending on the personal circumstances of the individual.  However, I note that the exemption limits are slightly above the point at which such individuals would enter into a liability to income tax based on the current PAYE and age tax credits.  As there have been no changes to personal PAYE or age tax credits in recent years, I do not see a need to review the exemption limits for those aged over 65.

Others who would pay income tax under the normal system would potentially have benefitted from the increase in the entry point to the higher rate as well.

I tabled the same amendment last year and the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, and I had some discussion on it in the House at the time.  The Minister has now changed and I wish the new Minister well in his position.  The outcome of the debate, however, was that the Department and the former Minister were to review the situation.  I am not sure if that review has taken place.  I hope it has and that it will inform this discussion. <\/p><p>The amendment would require the Minister, within three months of the passing of the Act, to prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on the possibility of extending the tax saver commuter ticket scheme to include parking costs associated with public transport.  In essence, the amendment would mean that, when one purchases a ticket for a train, bus, Luas or another of the multiple different public transport options to commute primarily into Dublin but also the main regional urban centres, one would be able to purchase the add-on of a parking ticket along with the fare.  The House will be aware of the extremely successful tax saver scheme whereby one can buy an annual train, bus or Luas ticket and have the cost deducted against tax.  It is efficient, cost-effective and convenient.  It also promotes consistency of behaviour because people travelling on a tax saver ticket do not make the choice of driving or getting the train or bus to work each day.  They form a pattern of behaviour in how they go about their business.  <\/p><p>The benefits of promoting public transport are many and are probably well-understood.  However, they might be worth recapping.  We have gridlock on many of our roads.  Flooding was exacerbated today in my county of Kildare and probably in many other places.  However, we have it on normal days as well.  We have congestion on our motorways.  A recent <i>Irish Times<\/i>report on the M50 noted how it is gridlocked and has reached capacity at a stage when we hope growth is still occurring in the economy and it is likely that the load on the motorway will be increased again.  The M4 and M7 and other major motorways are the same.  Unfortunately, we see the effects of this in the backlog of traffic going into our city centres and the knock-on effects on quality of life and climate change.  I asked the Taoiseach last week about climate change targets and it is likely that the State will miss its targets, which could result in fines of &euro;1 billion to &euro;1.5 billion, which is pertinent to the debate on this and future Finance Bills.  It is, therefore, in everyone's interest that we highlight climate change and promote public transport.<\/p><p>This is a good example of using the taxation system to reward and incentivise certain responsible public policy behaviours at the individual level.<\/p> <p> In the real world, while we would like to see everyone's journey start and finish on public transport, we must accept that it is often impractical to make the entire journey in this way.  I refer to the commuter belt, in particular.  I represent Kildare North but my point applies to the wider area of sprawl around Dublin.  Very many people in slightly outlying areas may have to drop children to a cr&egrave;che or perform other duties before they embark on their journey to work.  They must, of necessity, drive part of the way, park and then change to another mode of transport going to the city centre.<\/p> <p> Park-and-ride facilities are becoming more critical in the circumstances.  As of yet, however, we do not have any integrated ticketing or system whereby one can have a combined parking and rail ticket.  In recent years, Irish Rail moved to introduce an annual ticket at certain stations but, because it is not incorporated into the taxsaver scheme, it makes it that much more difficult to incentivise.  The objective of the scheme I propose is to include parking costs, paid for on an annual basis, as an add-on to the public transport fare.  The whole sum would be tax deductible to incentivise behaviour to make it easier and more convenient for the rail user or bus user.  There also would be a knock-on benefit in terms of consistency and reliability in respect of the journey.  One would not be fumbling for change every morning at the train station or trying to load the meter while watching a train pull away from the platform in front of one.  The frustration of the daily commuting experience could be alleviated slightly by having a measure such as the one I propose in place.<\/p> <p> In essence, the suggestion is that the taxsaver scheme, which has been very successful in influencing public transport behaviour, be extended to include the cost of parking.  It was not always a cost but has been in recent years.  The proposal would enable the commuter to make a single purchase once per year, with everything included.  This would be good public policy.  It would not be terribly difficult to implement.  We may discuss the implementation details in a moment but I hope the Minister will look on my proposal favourably.  As I stated, the previous Minister was positive about my amendment when I introduced it last year.  I await the current Minister's response.  My proposal would be a sensible and pragmatic measure that would reward good behaviour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200047#ZZ01000","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511373300,"counter":461,"content":"<p>Since Deputy Lawless raised this matter here last year, the Department of Finance has examined it.  I wish to outline the various reasons offered to me as to why I should not accept the Deputy's amendment and to have a dialogue with him about it.  The first point, which the Deputy has acknowledged in his contribution, is that the tax relief already available to anybody who purchases a commuter ticket is already very significant.  The taxsaver scheme was put in place to incentivise the purchase of tickets and it represents a very good investment on behalf of the State.<\/p>  <p>  One reason the existing scheme has been so robust over recent years is because it is very transparent.  By that, I mean that the providers of the tickets against which the tax relief can be claimed are all named in the primary legislation.  At the start of the year, one knows the cost of the tickets against which the relief may be drawn.  There also are conditions in place concerning providers or in other words, they are required to be regulated.  We must ensure that any service provider providing a ticket against which relief can be obtained is regulated.  A crucial challenge we would face in implementing the Deputy's proposal is that parking facilities are provided by a multitude of providers.  Parking exists in different formats.  For example, there are multi-storey facilities in some areas and single-storey facilities in others.  In others, parking may be in premises that are not used for anything else.  The charging is not set by or influenced by the State and can vary in many ways.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, there is a concern that were the scheme extended in the way proposed, it could have the unintended consequence of increasing the distance driven by commuters before they switch to public transport.  I have listened to the Deputy's contribution, however, and I believe he makes a fair point in that gaining access to a public transport facility in many counties requires the use of the car in the first instance.  While we are making strides to ensure there are public transport routes and options available to get people to a train station, for example, I acknowledge this is not possible at present for many commuters.  That is one reason there has been such investment in upgrading parking facilities in many counties, including the Deputy's, that are right beside public transport routes, particularly train routes.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that there could well be difficulties in minimising opportunities for misuse.  Let me give one concrete example.  These are the factors we need to consider when introducing any form of tax relief.  We could grant tax relief against the ticket but, of course, we could not have a guarantee regarding who might be using it.  Different people may use it.  It may be provided for an organisation or a company and different people might use it, despite the fact that tax relief is granted against the ticket itself.<\/p>  <p>  For all these reasons, I regret I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment.  It was considered.  I have outlined my reasons for not accepting it.  I do not know whether the Deputy is aware that one can purchase a parking pass, at a reduced rate, on the taxsaver website when availing of the benefits we are debating.  Perhaps this can be attributed to the debate we had here last year and the fact that the Deputy has been raising this matter.  Perhaps the issue the Deputy is raising here is being dealt with in another way.  We are giving those individuals who make a purchase on the website the opportunity to purchase at a reduced rate access to parking facilities that may well allow them to use the public transport.  The tax relief and the reduction in the cost of parking for those who make a purchase on the taxsaver website demonstrate an intention to provide the relief in a different way.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that the Deputy can see that, over the past year, we have considered the matter and have tried to make progress in a different way.  For the reasons I have outlined, I am not in a position to accept his amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200048#AAA00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1511373300,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for considering my points.  I acknowledge the progress since last year.  If I am still a Member next year, however, I will table my amendment again because there may still be some work to do in exploring it.<\/p>  <p>  I take the Minister's points on board.  I will respond to each of them.  The providers are named in the primary legislation.  I suggest that a review could recommend that a list of providers be extended.  That could be included in the primary legislation, which can always be updated.<\/p>  <p>  I believe there was a reference to the possible accrual, possibly accidentally, of a double benefit.  At present, it is possible to travel to Dublin using one's taxsaver rail ticket, disembark at Heuston Station and then use a bicycle purchased through the cycle-to-work scheme at a discount to cycle to the city centre.  This would involve rail and cycling as opposed to driving and rail.  I do not know, therefore, whether what the Minister suggests in this regard is necessarily a problem.<\/p>  <p>  I certainly agree there is a multitude of parking providers.  Regulations are being introduced by the National Transport Authority at present on managing commuter parking.  They typically concern clamping but also other issues that arise in parking management.  It is possible that the regulations could be extended to include measures such as those I propose.  In any case, the parking facilities are typically provided by the State providers, particularly Irish Rail.  My proposal could be implemented initially in Irish Rail's car parks only if that would get around the difficulty.<\/p>  <p>  As for the potential for overuse, I must disagree with the Minister's analysis or the Department's analysis.  This matter arose last year.  The same point has been made even though I responded to it last year.  I am going to respond to it again.  If we have the debate next year, let us hope we can move this on.<\/p><p>I do not accept the point that the ticket could be abused or re-used by multiple persons or entities because there is a very simple check.  In the same way that a train ticket cannot be given to another person to use because it contains ID on it, by the same token a car registration plate could be used.  As one typically does not swap cars around, the same car can be parked in a space in the station every morning.  That is the system most parking systems use already as an identifier.  It is built into the system.  I suggest that the issue could be re-examined because there is a very simple way to address the concern.  I thank the Minister for his response.  I suggest that the issue could be looked at again as there is scope to revisit it.  Some of the points that have been made could be countered.  Where there is a will there is a way and it would be worth doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200048#AAA00300","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511373900,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I believe we will be here next year and we can look at this matter again then.  I have a Leap card and I am aware that it took years to make it happen.  Now that I see how Leap cards are used, I understand why it took so long to make it available.  Technology is now being made available to allow the Leap card to be used on more forms of public transport.  It is now possible, for example, to put one's photo on the card to ensure that if it is lost, one can get it back.  I am very much in favour of looking at measures in the tax code to incentivise more use of public transport.<\/p>  <p>  I will give an example of the kind of difficulty we need to manage, which is the reason I cannot accept the amendment but am happy to look at further ideas in the year ahead in regard to it.  Deputy Lawless made the point a moment ago that if we were to list the various providers in legislation, we could begin to make the relief available to some providers rather than others.  From a tax policy point of view I cannot do that because what would then happen is those parking providers, for example a private sector company providing parking from a facility that is beside an Irish Rail train station &ndash; Deputy Lawless knows where this argument is going &ndash; the owner of that facility would then claim he or she is being disadvantaged by the tax relief.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Lawless referred to the legislation on the regulation of clamping companies.  I introduced that legislation when I was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I remember all of the challenges we had in terms of trying to define property and where clamping takes place.  I assure the Deputy that if during the year he comes up with further ideas on how the matter can be addressed I will engage positively with him because I am open to such ideas.  Perhaps one thing we could do arising out of this debate is to ascertain if we can find out how many commuters have access to parking at a reduced price because that might help us understand the potential scale of the opportunity to which the Deputy refers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200049#BBB00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1511373900,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

It operates by providing that any gains realised on the exercise of qualifying KEEP share options will not be subject to income tax, PRSI or USC at the date of exercise.  The gain will, however, be subject to capital gains tax on a future disposal of the shares.<\/p><p>The relief therefore has a twofold benefit.  First, it reduces the tax payable from income tax to capital gains tax rates.  Second, and possibly more important from the perspective of small unquoted companies, it provides that the tax will become payable on disposal of the shares, when the sales proceeds would be available to pay the tax due.<\/p><p>These amendments make two technical changes to the KEEP legislation in order to ensure that it operates as intended.  Report Stage amendments Nos. 11 and 12 amend the definition of &quot;qualifying company&quot; to ensure the inclusion of enterprises in sectors that are part of Ireland's strategic enterprise and employment priorities.  It expands the definition of qualifying company to include companies that provide pharmaceutical and engineering services.<\/p><p>My officials have continued to engage with small business representatives following the publication of the Finance Bill, and it was identified that the legislation could have the unintended consequence of incentivising a company not to grow beyond small and medium enterprise, SME, size while qualifying KEEP share options were on issue.  Amendments Nos. 13 to 20, inclusive, correct this issue by amending the definition of &quot;qualifying company&quot; to specify that the conditions relating to the SME size requirement and the cap of &euro;3 million on the maximum value of issued but unexercised qualifying KEEP options are to apply only at the time of the granting of KEEP share options.

Let us suppose the space was constructed and the company was able to claim accelerated capital allowances for the building in which the gym was situated.  In addition, the relief would be 100% for the gym equipment.  What happens after three years if the gym closes and it becomes a store for the shop or supermarket that created it in the first place?

Must the facilities be made available to all employees free of charge in order that the provider can benefit from the allowances?  One could imagine a scenario in which an employer or the top executives of a company build a very nice child care facility for themselves which they do not make available to other employees in the workplace.  In such circumstances, the facility would be a major boon for the bosses but of no benefit to the workers.  Similarly, one could imagine a nice spanking gym being provided for the executives or owners of a company, which would be of no benefit to general employees.

Families all over Ireland who bought small properties during the boom are in negative equity to this day.  Their families are growing and the properties they bought between 2002 and 2008 are not suitable to raise growing families.  As a result, they are left with an unenviable set of choices.  They can stay in the apartment or small house in which they are living and raise their children in unsuitable accommodation, try to sell their property which is impossible in most cases because they are in negative equity or rent out the apartment in which they are living and try to find a suitable, slightly larger home in which to raise their children.  The problem is that if they choose to rent out their apartment and rent an apartment in which to raise their children, they are hit with a substantial tax bill at the end of the year.<\/p><p>Let us say that a couple decides to rent out their apartment for which they take in &euro;1,000 a month in rent and they go and rent a two or three-bedroom semi-detached house to raise the children in on which they also pay &euro;1,000.  Obviously, in Dublin they would pay a lot more.  Let us assume they take in &euro;1,000 in a month and they pay out &euro;1,000 a month, and their household finances are exactly the same.  They have no additional income.  They are taking rent in and they themselves are paying rent out, and they are no better off financially.  The tax code taxes the rental income they take in.  There are some amounts one can write off for interest payments but, in most cases, most of the rent they take in is taxed at the marginal rate of approximately 50%.  If a couple is taking in rent of &euro;1,000 a month, they will take in &euro;12,000 by the end of the year.  Let us say approximately &euro;10,000 of that is taxable, after deductions, at the marginal rate.  Therefore, a couple in a modest situation, taking in &euro;1,000 and paying out &euro;1,000, gets hit with a &euro;5,000 tax bill.  What is happening is some such couples are moving and hoping to God the taxman never finds them because they cannot pay it - they do not have &euro;5,000 at the end of the year.  Others are moving for the sake of their children but they are caught in a trap because now they cannot save any money because they are getting hit with this extra &euro;5,000 a year in tax.  I know people in this situation.  No doubt the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, knows people in this situation.  We are of a similar age and it is mainly a particular age group who got caught in this who have been trapped.<\/p> <p> This is my fourth year trying to get some relief for those who are stuck in this situation.  Last year, on Committee Stage, I raised it with the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, who essentially said that he was not willing to accept it on Committee Stage because he believed it could be gamed.  He stated there are too many ways around this and it is not restrictive enough and he gave specific instances where he felt it could be gamed.  I went and took solid legal advice and I drafted an amendment that was very restrictive and on Committee Stage I went through the various restrictions.  I tabled it on Report Stage and the Minister never engaged in the detail.  He merely dismissed it using the same logic he had used on Committee Stage, stating this could be gamed.<\/p> <p> On Committee Stage this year, I tabled it again, but the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, was substituting for the Minister at the time.  I stated that I understood this amendment will be technically flawed.  We have just passed an amendment on tax deductibles for gyms and cr&egrave;ches consisting of three pages of technical legal text and I am aware that what I have tabled will contain flaws.  That is why I asked that, if the Government agreed that these people have to be taken out of this trap, the Minister would come forward on Report Stage with his own amendment because none of us has access to the civil servants and technical support needed to get the amendment right.  I was very disappointed to see the Minister did not submit his own amendment that would free these people from it.<\/p> <p> Ultimately, this comes down to political will.  It is not a technical issue.  I have taken solid legal advice stating there are probably some tweaks and changes that would need to be made to my amendment but the basic idea, what I am trying to achieve here, is well within the wit of legislators to incorporate into the tax code.  That is not the issue.<\/p> <p> Last year, I engaged at great length with the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, on section 110 entities and closing vulture funds.  There was advice to the Minister stating that one could not do this and one could not do that but, ultimately, the then Minister decided it was going to happen.  It happened, and an entire section of Ireland's tax code was rewritten.  The Government then decided that it was bringing in a new section of tax code, the real estate investment funds, and an entire new chapter of tax law was written for that.  I went through that at length with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, then Minister of State at the Department of Finance, who went out of his way to explain that businesses could not be double-taxed and there was all sorts being done to ensure that under no circumstances would these be double-taxed.  For professional property investors in this country, there are significant tax breaks in place.  The vulture funds still use significant tax breaks.  Any of the vulture funds that various Members in this House have gone through over the past few years might declare &euro;500 million in assets and &euro;50 million in profit, and will pay &euro;250 in tax.  By comparison, one family trying to raise their children, that has rented out their apartment that they wished to God they had never bought and that is sitting in a house, gets hit not with a &euro;250 tax bill like the vulture funds but with a &euro;5,000 tax bill.  One family is paying 20 times more tax under the current situation than a vulture fund with &euro;0.5 billion in assets.<\/p> <p> I implore the Minister.  It is all I can do at this stage because the merits of the argument do not seem to have worked over the past four years.  These people are trapped and they need help and we can help them.  I ask the Minister to look at the amendment, take it seriously and tell us whether or not he agrees with what it is trying to achieve and then we can work together to see if an amendment from the Minister could be brought forward by the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200051#DDD02700","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511375700,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Donnelly's amendment.<\/p>  <p>  As in Wicklow, we in Kildare North are no strangers to accidental landlords and multiple starter homes in negative equity which remain so.  The phenomenon of accidental landlords is well understood right around the commuter belt and elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Donnelly stated, unfortunately these individuals are taxed at the marginal rate.  I suppose the key inequality is that - Deputy Donnelly alluded to the vulture funds - any kind of commercial entity or corporate structure, for instance, a local commercial interest, leasing the same house as the unfortunate young couple or individual who has ended up as an accidental landlord avails of far greater reliefs and a far more attractive tax rate and, indeed, draws down far more allowances than the personal taxation levied on the poor unfortunate accidental landlord.<\/p>  <p>  I understood there were moves afoot to include the likes of deduction of local property tax, LPT, to include additional allowances and some sort of gesture towards the time involved in leasing a property, even if not the entire cost.  Some may choose to manage the lease themselves rather than incur the additional expense of employing property agents.  I understood there was some movement towards that but I am not sure whether that has been reflected in the Bill to date.<\/p>  <p>  I concur with Deputy Donnelly.

We are talking here about a relatively small number of couples who are in quite a horrendous situation.  Let us be upfront and straight about it: they are victims of the property crash.  The Minister will know them.  I certainly know some of them.  I had a couple in to me a few months ago who are living in a two-bedroom duplex apartment.  They were considering renting that out and renting somewhere else, but when I took them through what that would mean for them, in terms of the taxation treatment of their rental income, the loss of mortgage interest relief on their existing principal private residence etc. they quickly realised it simply was not possible.  What they had done previously was divide a boxroom into two bedrooms - the Minister can imagine what that looks like.  The reality facing many such people is stark.<\/p>  <p>  We already have differentiation in the tax code in relation to certain rental income.  With the rent-a-room relief, for example, up to &euro;14,000 of income is exempt.<\/p>  <p>  The point must also be made that many of these borrowers face the prospect of never owning another home.  That is the reality because some of them are still in negative equity and, under the Central Bank deposit rules, as the Minister will be aware, non-first-time buyers face a 20% deposit requirement.  Even if they hang on in there until the negative equity is gone and they sell the unsuitable property, they face the prospect of coming up with a 20% deposit for the property which they would like to buy to meet their new family needs and it is just not possible.  It is not a runner for the vast majority.<\/p><p>I would expect any measure like this to be very tightly controlled.  We would need very strong anti-avoidance provisions.

Vulture funds are getting tax breaks and are paying only &euro;400 or &euro;500 on millions in profits but the people to whom Deputy Donnelly refers are struggling in many cases.  The Minister should listen to the Deputies and accept what they are proposing.  If the amendment needs more tweaking to make it foolproof, then so be it.

Many of these funds will walk away having paid literally nothing in tax unlike those who are caught up accidentally in a situation which is largely not of their making but the making of another generation of property speculators.

He raised it with me in the first instance a week and a half ago.  We had a discussion on the matter over the phone.  I am sympathetic to the issue that the Deputy raises because many of my constituents are facing the same kind of difficulty to which he refers.  That said, when I asked my officials to examine the issue over the past week, many matters arose which made it very difficult for me to be even able to offer an alternative amendment on behalf of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  I will now illustrate some of the issues that arise in the context of Deputy Donnelly's amendment.  Three issues came to light when we began to consider it.  I want to acknowledge that this is a different amendment which approaches the issue in a different way than was done in the past.  I considered this amendment on its own merits, as I have already indicated to the Deputy.  Three matters arise from the amendment which mean that I am not in a position to accept it here this evening.  However, I am happy to engage with the Deputy on this issue afterwards to see if there is some way to deal with the issue without causing difficulties elsewhere in the tax code or giving rise to tax avoidance issues that I would have to deal with at a future date.<\/p>  <p>  The first point is that the amendment makes a judgment that any property less than 113 square metres, or approximately 1,000 square feet, would be unsuitable as a home for an individual or a family.  It is the case, however, particularly in many urban areas that many people will reside in properties that are smaller than that.  This amendment, as drafted, will then create a difficulty for citizens in properties that are smaller than 113 square metres.  The amendment as currently drafted would involve extending the relief to all first-time buyers between 2002 and 2008 who are renting an alternative or larger property.  One of the issues that I ran into quite quickly is the fact that there may be many reasons for people to move on to acquire a second property.  Included within that are the issues and pressures to which the Deputy has referred, which I acknowledge.  However, there may be other reasons for people moving on to acquire another property.  If I accept this amendment, it may cause problems for me in terms of the reasons for which this relief might then be drawn down.  Finally, the amendment as written assumes that all accidental landlords have moved on to properties with more bedrooms.  Therefore, it might exclude a family that moved to a property of the same or even smaller size in order to be closer to family support, to a school or to public transport.  It is for all of these reasons that I am not in a position to accept this amendment.  However, what I have not done is reject the amendment giving the same reasons that were proffered last year.  The Deputy has submitted a different amendment but the fact that he only raised this issue relatively recently with me meant that I was not in a position to find an alternative way to deal with the issue that would satisfy me.  I have just outlined several reasons as to why this particular amendment will not work but I am happy, following this debate, to engage with the Deputy to determine if there are ways in which this issue can be dealt with that do not trigger other problems with which I would then have to deal.  It is for these reasons that I am not in a position to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200053#FFF00500","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1511376300,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.
