In determining and reviewing the investment strategy, the Agency will consult with and have regard to the views of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, who may consult\u00a0other Ministers. <\/p><p>  In this context, and to the extent that there are financing gaps in the construction of social, affordable and local authority homes which can be filled on a commercial basis, it will be open to\u00a0the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, the legislation for which will be enacted over the coming months, to\u00a0consider addressing such gaps subject to its overall investment mandate. The ISIF may have a role to play as long as a commercial investment is structured that supports economic growth and employment in Ireland. The investment must be structured in a way that does not result in it being classified as expenditure under government accounting rules otherwise there would need to be compensating expenditure cuts made elsewhere.\u00a0<\/p><p>  I might add that the Government's Construction Strategy, published on\u00a014 May, aims to support a return to a sustainable and properly functioning property and construction sector as an essential part of our national economic recovery. As stated in the Strategy, ensuring every citizen has access to suitable housing is a key policy goal of Government.<\/p><p>  The Government will continue to prioritise the delivery of good quality social housing, including the return to mainstream local authority housing construction this year; enhancing the role of the not-for-profit sector in the provision of social homes; and continuing to work with NAMA, the Local Authorities, and approved housing bodies to maximise delivery of units owned by NAMA or its debtors for social housing. We will identify the best ways to deliver social housing for the years ahead through the development of a comprehensive strategy for Social Housing, setting out a vision for the sector.<\/p><p>  - It is estimated that in the region of 5,000 new Social Housing units will be provided in 2014 through leasing and existing capital programmes. This includes completion of mortgage-to-rent arrangements; the continued transfer of units owned by NAMA or its debtors; completion of existing building and acquisition programmes; and transfers under the Rental Accommodation Scheme.<\/p><p>  - Budget 2014 contained innovative housing measures, and announced an additional &euro;30m investment in local authority housing. This &euro;30m investment is expected to provide a substantial number of new and refurbished homes for people on housing waiting lists. Approximately half of this investment will enable the construction of new infill developments in areas with the highest demand for social housing.<\/p><p>  - In March, the Minister for Housing and Planning launched a two year &euro;68m local authority home building initiative, which will build some 449 new social homes for families in need of housing. This investment represents the first return to new mainstream local authority house building since the beginning of the financial crisis.<\/p><p>  - Details of a &euro;15m fund to bring vacant local authority houses back into use were announced in April. This fund will bring 952 vacant local authority units back into beneficial use, providing high quality homes for people in need of housing, while also providing employment through labour intensive activity.<\/p><p>  - This year will also see the completion of a three year &euro;100m investment that will provide 800 units for older people, people with a disability or people without a home.<\/p><p>  - We are currently in the process of rolling out a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) which, in addition to helping to remove barriers to employment for recipients, will contribute to the creation of a higher quality private rented sector through improved standards.<\/p><p>  - The contribution of the not-for-profit sector in the provision of social housing will be facilitated by introducing legislation to regulate the sector. Regulation will enhance the ability of approved housing bodies to attract private finance.<\/p><p>  - The Construction Strategy states that later this year we will publish a Social Housing Strategy setting out a vision for the sector, and we will introduce legislation to regulate the Approved Housing Body sector.<\/p><p>  - The Strategy includes measures to ensure that financing is available to support necessary and viable development. In particular, a High Level Working Group, led by the department of Finance will be established to examine the availability of both banking and non-banking sources of finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300051#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300051#WRA00700"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[28548\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300051#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the effect the Government policy has had since 2007 of downsizing of the public sector and cutting wages on the wage share-wages as a percentage of GDP; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1195","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>The economic crisis exposed a large underlying mismatch between public expenditure and revenue, much of which was structural in nature and unrelated to the economic cycle.\u00a0 This necessitated substantial fiscal consolidation in order to ensure that the public finances remained on a sustainable path.\u00a0 Given the size of the fiscal imbalances, adjustments were needed on both the revenue and expenditure sides of the accounts.\u00a0 In the choice of consolidation instrument, the\u00a0Government has always been conscious of the need to minimise the impact on economic activity.<\/p><p>  Roughly two-thirds of\u00a0the adjustment since 2008 has been on the expenditure side.\u00a0 Part of this has been achieved with public sector payroll savings which have been achieved in a largely progressive manner.<\/p><p>  In the private sector, hourly earnings have remained broadly flat in the aftermath of the crisis.\u00a0 These wage developments have played an important part in the ongoing improvement in Irish competitiveness and are one of the main reasons why employment is now growing so strongly - I would point out that the level of employment is nearly 4 per cent higher than its low-point and FDI inflows have been very strong.\u00a0 It is unlikely that either of these would have occurred without the improvement in competitiveness that we have seen in recent years. <\/p><p>  The wage share of national income has remained broadly constant during the crisis years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300051#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Transactions Tax","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300051#WRA01000"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[28363\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300051#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his position on mooted proposals at European Union level to introduce a financial transactions tax.","asker":"1190","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p> The Government's position is that a Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) would be best applied on a wide international basis to include the major financial centres to prevent the danger of activities gravitating to jurisdictions where taxes are not levied on financial transactions.\u00a0 Notwithstanding this, the Government is not prepared to stand in the way of EU Member States that wish to work together to implement a Financial Transactions Tax and in this regard adoption of a decision formally authorising enhanced cooperation took place during the Irish Presidency of the EU in January 2013.<\/p><p>  The proposal for a Directive from the European Commission in the area of financial transaction tax was published in February 2013.\u00a0Ireland had many concerns about the proposal as drafted, not least of which were the potential impacts on, and the trading of, Irish Sovereign debt in the secondary market and in total, the potential negative impact on the liquidity of the financial sector as a whole.

Either way, I have no plans to change the rate of income tax relief on pension contributions. There have been a number of significant changes in the tax relief arrangements for contributions to pension savings over recent years:<\/p><p>  - The annual earnings limit for determining (with age-related limits) the maximum allowable tax-relieved pension contributions in any one year was reduced from over &euro;275,000 to &euro;150,000 per annum for the tax year 2009 and was further reduced in 2011 to its current level of &euro;115,000 (representing a reduction of over 58% in the annual earnings cap from its peak in 2008).<\/p><p>  - From 1 January 2011, employee contributions to occupational pension schemes and other pension arrangements were made subject to employee PRSI (they were previously exempt) and were also made subject to the Universal Social Charge.<\/p><p>  - The employer PRSI exemption in respect of employee contributions to occupational pension schemes and other pension arrangements was reduced by 50% from 1 January 2011 with the remaining 50% relief removed by Finance Act 2012 with effect from 1 January 2012.<\/p><p>  - The maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes (the Standard Fund Threshold or SFT) was reduced from its indexed level of over &euro;5.4 million to &euro;2.3 million from 7 December 2010 (equating to the scale of the reduction in the annual earnings limit described above).<\/p><p>  - Finally, in Budget 2014 and Finance (No 2) Act 2013, in line with the commitment I made in the previous Budget to restrict the subsidisation of pensions by taxpayers to those that deliver income up to &euro;60,000 per annum, I further reduced the SFT from &euro;2.3 million to &euro;2 million with effect from 1 January 2014 as well as making other changes to the SFT regime.<\/p><p>  The primary purpose of the changes made to the SFT regime is to further restrict the capacity of higher earners to fund or accrue large pensions through tax-subsidised sources. The SFT regime addresses the problem of pension overfunding and excessive pension accrual by dealing with it at the point of pension drawdown in retirement rather than by applying restrictions to pension savings or accrual upfront. The regime achieves this by imposing a higher tax charge (effectively 65% excluding liability to USC or other charges) on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down. In this way it acts to discourage the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinds the tax advantage of such overfunding by clawing back, through the higher tax charge, the tax relief granted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300051#WRA01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Administration","counter":20,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300051#WRA01900"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[28361\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300051#WRA02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason a person who offered to have their property tax bill deducted from their pension, had that request declined on the basis that they would be left with an income below &euro;186, and as a result has been levied with penalties for the arrears, penalties which continue to rise; and his views on whether this is fair and equitable.","asker":"1192","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":22,"content":"<p>As the Deputy has not provided details of the case in question, I am not in a position to address the specific circumstances and will, instead, respond in general to the matters raised.<\/p><p>By way of general comment, the deduction at source payment option, including from Department of Social Protection (DSP) payments, is a very efficient and cost effective payment method for Local Property Tax (LPT) and arrears of Household Charge (HHC). There are no fees or charges associated with deduction at source and the property owner simply indicates their payment preference on the LPT Return form. The deduction at source payment method, once selected and implemented for any particular year, carries forward to following years unless an alternative payment method is selected <\/p><p>However, deduction at source from DSP payments cannot be facilitated where such weekly deductions would have the effect of reducing the person's take home amount to below the minimum weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, which is currently &euro;186 per week. The concept of a de minimis welfare payment from DSP is enshrined in social welfare legislation and it was considered, at the time of the introduction of LPT, that it was not appropriate to change the law in this regard.<\/p><p>In regard to the operation of the DSP deduction at source payment method, I am advised by Revenue that there is ongoing dialogue between its officials and DSP to ensure that the system runs as smoothly as possible and that where it is not possible to deduct LPT payments from a liable person on foot of the de minimis rule, that early notification is provided and alternative payment methods put in place. <\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy's comments on the application of penalties, I am advised by Revenue that no such penalties have been levied to date on any case where deduction at source from a DSP payment was refused on foot of the &euro;186 limit. The Deputy may actually be referring to the increase in Household Charge (HHC) arrears liabilities from &euro;100 to &euro;200 with effect from 1 July 2013. Section 156 of the Finance Local Property Tax Act (as amended) converted all such arrears of HHC to LPT and made Revenue responsible for the collection of those amounts. This increase was applied to all HHC arrears regardless of any subsequently selected payment method, including HHC. \u00a0During the recent HHC Arrears \/ LPT compliance campaign, Revenue gave a commitment that penalties or interest would not be applied against any person who met their obligations by the end of April 2014. <\/p><p>Recipients of DSP payments should be aware that the LPT legislation provides for full and partial (50%) deferrals of the tax within certain specified thresholds. For example, a property owner can claim a full deferral where his\/her gross income does not exceed &euro;15,000 if single\/ widowed or, &euro;25,000 in the case of a couple. To qualify for a partial deferral, the property owner's gross income must not exceed &euro;25,000 if single\/widowed or, &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple. These income threshold limits can also be adjusted upwards by including 80% of any gross mortgage interest payments. The interest element of any such deferral or partial deferral is 4% as distinct from the normal 8% charge that applies in respect of unpaid liabilities. Any person whose sole income is such that the deduction of LPT would bring them under the &euro;186 limit will qualify for the deferral or partial deferral (including deferral of the Household Charge arrears).\u00a0 I am assured by Revenue that the application process for deferral and partial deferral is a simple matter and can be done through the online system at or by contacting the LPT Helpline at 1890 200 255. In most circumstances where a deferral or partial deferral is granted, it remains in place for the current valuation period, i.e. for the tax years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. <\/p><p>If a person who is eligible does not want to avail of the deferral or partial deferral he or she should make alternative arrangements to meet the LPT\/HHC obligations through one of the other payment options that Revenue has put in place. For example, where the deduction at source option is not available property owners can avail of monthly direct debits through their financial institution or certain credit union accounts.\u00a0 Alternatively they can make regular weekly or monthly payments to one of the four approved payment service providers, which are An Post, Payzone, PayPoint and Omnivend. Details in regard to the payment service providers including information on the various transaction fees are available on the Revenue website at . It is important that I stress at this point that where property owners have already been advised that they are unable to avail of deduction at source from a DSP scheme in respect of LPT\/HHC liabilities, they should immediately telephone the LPT Branch helpline at 1890 200 255 to make alternative payment arrangements.<\/p><p>Revenue has confirmed to me that almost 14,000 property owners availed of deduction at source from DSP payments to meet their LPT liabilities during 2013. Shortfalls in payment on foot of the &euro;186 threshold occurred in 1,203 of these cases, of which 200 were for less than &euro;10. Revenue contacted this tranche of property owners in April 2014 to advise on the various payment alternatives available including deferral or partial deferral.\u00a0 No interest or penalties were applied in these cases and alternative payment arrangements have been made by many of those contacted. The number of property owners opting for deduction at source from DSP payments in respect of both 2014 LPT and arrears of HHC has risen to almost 25,000 to date. Similarly to 2013, Revenue has identified and contacted almost 2,000 of these cases which are impacted by the &euro;186 threshold to advise on the various payment alternatives, no interest or penalties have been applied and in most cases other payment arrangements have been put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300051#WRA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Remit","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300051#WRA02200"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[28545\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300051#WRA02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the role he envisages for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland; the reason it will not have a banking licence; his views that this will inhibit its ability to provide credit in the marketplace; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":25,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Taoiseach and Chancellor Merkel last year sought, when we were exiting the EU\/IMF Programme, to\u00a0specifically to find ways to reinforce Ireland's economic recovery by improving funding mechanisms for the real economy, including access to finance for Irish SMEs.

However, it will not be possible to make a formal application to the ESM for retrospective recapitalisation in advance of the Instrument being in place. The issue of the timing of any application has yet to be decided.\u00a0 Similarly, the amount to be sought will be considered in the context of the overall application, and it would be premature, and indeed contrary to our interests, to identify an amount at this stage.<\/p><p>  In conclusion, I should emphasise that both I and my Government colleagues continue to ensure that Ireland's case for retrospective direct recapitalisation is made at all levels as appropriate.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300051#WRA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2015","counter":29,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300051#WRA02800"},{"type":"question","counter":30,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[28544\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300051#WRA02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will publish financial projections in advance of  budget 2015 outlining the expected deficit next year under a range of different adjustment levels; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":31,"content":"<p>The most up-to-date budgetary estimates, published in the Stability Programme Update \u00a0(SPU) in April, are based on the assumption of a consolidation package of &euro;2.0bn in 2015 which is designed to deliver a deficit of 2.9 per cent of GDP in 2015.

In presenting the results, they outlined that they had explored a number of options for Shannon Airport &ndash; including the prepositioning of relief items, the prepositioning of medical supplies, the possible development of a training facility at the airport and the establishment of a depot for civil protection assets.<\/p><p>  The study concluded that the various roles explored did not demonstrate sufficient economic viability in relation to the development of Shannon Airport in the manner which was envisaged under the Programme for Government. This conclusion was based on a cost-benefit analysis and is the result of consultation with a large number of international humanitarian organisations and agencies, and potential end users of such a hub.<\/p><p>  On the basis of the findings that there was no justifiable, economically viable rationale for advancing the plans to develop Shannon Airport in this manner, the decision was taken not to proceed. This decision, along with the feasibility study, has been publicly available on the Irish Aid website since December 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300052#WRB05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid Expenditure","counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300052#WRB05300"},{"type":"question","counter":85,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[28899\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300052#WRB05400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will outline in tabular form the budget of Irish development aid as a percentage of GNP in the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":86,"content":"<p>This Government is very strongly committed to Ireland&rsquo;s overseas aid programme and to its place at the heart of Irish foreign policy.

The reliefs can not apply to properties that were not adapted for use by incapacitated persons. <\/p><p>  In regard to the specific case to which the Deputy refers, Revenue has confirmed to me that the person in question paid his LPT liabilities in respect of both 2013 and 2014, but according to the HHC records received from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) did not pay the original &euro;100 Household Charge (HHC) in respect of 2012. The LGMA records also confirmed that there was no exemption or waiver in place in respect of the property.<\/p><p>  By way of background information, Section 156 of the Act converted all HHC arrears still outstanding on 1 July 2013 to LPT, increased the liability from &euro;100 to &euro;200 per property and made Revenue responsible for collecting the liabilities. \u00a0Revenue has no discretion in this regard and is obliged to apply the &euro;200 charge as set down in the legislation.<\/p><p>  Revenue has informed me that a member of the LPT team has already discussed this case with the parent of the person in question and confirmed that the property does not qualify for an exemption from LPT because it was not adapted for use by an incapacitated person, nor does it qualify for an exemption from HHC on the basis of the records received from the LGMA.

The interest element of any such deferral is 4% as distinct from the normal 8% charge that applies in respect of unpaid liabilities and in most circumstances remains in place for the valuation period, i.e. currently for the tax years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. <\/p><p>  The LPT team member committed to again contact the parent in the coming days once the family has had an opportunity to further consider both the deferral option and the various payment methods that Revenue has made available to pay the arrears of HHC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300053#WRC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300053#WRC02600"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[28888\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300053#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"with regard to a couple who have joint custody of their child but are separated, the reason the single parent tax credit cannot be assigned to the father at the mother's request, because they are in receipt of the credit for another child.","asker":"1192","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":120,"content":"<p>An individual, (the 'primary claimant'), is entitled to the single person child carer credit (SPCCC) where he or she:<\/p><p>- Is not married, cohabiting or in a civil partnership,<\/p><p>- Is not jointly assessed or in receipt of the basic personal tax credit for a widowed person or a surviving civil partner, and <\/p><p>- Proves that for a tax year he or she has a qualifying child residing with him or her for the whole or the greater part of that year. <\/p><p>If the primary claimant does not wish to claim the credit, (e.g. because of insufficient taxable income to use the credit fully), he or she may surrender the credit in favour of another person, (the 'secondary claimant'), who has a significant role in caring for the child.<\/p><p>The secondary claimant is only entitled to the SPCCC, following the surrender of it by the primary claimant, where he or she: <\/p><p>- Is not married, cohabiting or in a civil partnership,<\/p><p>- Is not jointly assessed or in receipt of the basic personal tax credit for a widowed person or a surviving civil partner, and<\/p><p>- Proves that for a tax year he or she has a qualifying child residing with him or her for at least 100 days in the year. <\/p><p>The SPCCC is designed to be an in-work benefit to support the principal carer of a child or children to take up, or remain in, employment.\u00a0 However, there is entitlement to only one credit no matter how many qualifying children reside with a claimant, whether that person is a primary or secondary claimant.\u00a0 Therefore, where the credit is claimed by a primary claimant, there is no credit available to be surrendered to a secondary claimant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300053#WRC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Growth","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300053#WRC02900"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[28910\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300053#WRC03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he expects to be in a position to use economic growth as a means of reducing the debt to GDP ratio in the context of the forthcoming budget having particular regard to the criteria set out by the troika and the equally pressing need for some ameliorating measures to facilitate economic growth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>The recent forecast by my Department, contained in the Stability Programme Update, shows the general government debt to GDP ratio reducing from 123.7% in 2013 to 107.2% in 2018.<\/p><p>  In the short term, a reduction in the cash balances held by the State will assist in the reduction of the debt ratio.

Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion last year and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their targets.<\/p><p>  Having completed a process of deleveraging, both AIB and Bank of Ireland are now concentrating on growing their balance sheets.\u00a0\u00a0 In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending in the period up to 2016, including lending for working capital purposes, and have put on record their commitment to the SME sector.\u00a0 Although the targets were a useful policy intervention, the focus now needs to shift towards the collation and examination, on a monthly basis, of more granular data on the funding of the activities of SMEs from both AIB and Bank of Ireland, the wider banking sector and increasingly the non-bank funding sector. This focus is further underpinned by the commitments contained in the &quot;Access to Finance&quot; chapter in Action Plan for Jobs 2014. I recently wrote to the banks with a view to ensuring\u00a0their continued commitment to work closely with my Department in faciliatating a positive business environment in which SMEs can prosper and contribute to economic growth, in addition to maintaining and increasing jobs in this vital sector. In addition, AIB and Bank of Ireland meet my officials on a quarterly basis to keep them abreast of issues pertaining to the SME sector, both in the area of SME lending and distressed SME borrowers.<\/p><p>  I\u00a0would remind the Deputy that the Credit Review Office look at cases where borrowers have their loan applications refused or feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.

The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers in genuine mortgage difficulty. In that context, provision 39 of the CCMA provides that, in order to determine which options for alternative repayment arrangements are viable for each particular case, a lender must explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements offered by that lender. Such alternative repayment arrangements may include:<\/p><p>a) interest only repayments on the mortgage for a specified period of time;<\/p><p>b) permanently reducing the interest rate on the mortgage;<\/p><p>c) temporarily reducing the interest rate on the mortgage for a specified period of time;<\/p><p>d) an arrangement to pay interest and part of the normal capital amount for a specified period of time;<\/p><p>e) deferring payment of all or part of the scheduled mortgage repayment for a specified period of time;<\/p><p>f) extending the term of the mortgage;<\/p><p>g) changing the type of the mortgage;<\/p><p>h) adding arrears and interest to the principal amount due;<\/p><p>i) equity participation;<\/p><p>j) warehousing part of the mortgage (including through a split mortgage);<\/p><p>k) reducing the principal sum to a specified amount; and<\/p><p>l) any voluntary scheme to which the lender has signed up e.g. Deferred Interest Scheme.<\/p><p>However, if a lender does not offer a borrower an alternative repayment arrangement (for example, where it is concluded that the mortgage is not sustainable and an alternative repayment arrangement is unlikely to be appropriate), the CCMA requires that the lender must provide the reasons, on paper or another durable medium, to the borrower and also provide the further information set out in provision 45 of the CCMA including the other options available to the borrower in such circumstances such as voluntary surrender, trading down, mortgage to rent or voluntary sale and the implications of each option for the borrower.\u00a0 The same information must be given to the borrower if he\/she does not accept the alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender.<\/p><p>Furthermore, under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) process, the Central Bank is requiring the main lenders to work through their mortgages in arrears (both primary dwelling and buy to let mortgages) of more than 90 days and, where possible, to &quot;propose&quot; and &quot;conclude&quot; sustainable solutions with their borrowers in arrears.\u00a0 The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank has now set quarterly targets to the end of 2014 by which time the relevant banks will be required to &quot;propose&quot; sustainable solutions to 85% of customers over 90 days in mortgage arrears and for &quot;concluded&quot; solutions to reach 45%.\u00a0 The latest data from the Central Bank on the ongoing MART process, which is in respect of the period to end 2013, is at the following link: .<\/p><p>Any bank proceeding to legal action or otherwise seeking the loss of ownership with co-operating borrowers, in circumstances where a sustainable alternative repayment arrangement is feasible and can be agreed, is not acting in a manner consistent with the MART process, or with the CCMA.\u00a0 Of course, the CCMA and MART can only achieve positive\u00a0results\u00a0in circumstances where the borrower and lender cooperate and engage with the process.\u00a0If a borrower is not happy with the way that their lender is dealing with them, or if they think they are not complying with the CCMA, the borrower can make a complaint to their lender.\u00a0 Borrowers can also make an appeal to the lender's Appeals Board if they are not happy with the alternative repayment arrangement offered, or if the lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement or if they believe they have been wrongly classified as not co-operating. If the borrower is not happy with the outcome of the appeal\/complaint made to the lender, they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO). Further information on how to make a complaint to the FSO is available at www.financialombudsman.ie.<\/p><p>The Central Bank has informed me that, through the MART process, the relevant statutory codes (such as the CCMA) and through regulatory engagement with the individual banks, it continues to monitor progress in dealing with mortgage arrears.\u00a0 As part of this engagement process, the Central Bank has also indicated that it intends to commence a review of mortgage lenders' compliance with the CCMA later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300053#WRC05600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":149,"content":"<p>Question No. 59 answered with Question No. 57.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Charges","counter":150,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300053#WRC05800"},{"type":"question","counter":151,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[28941\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300053#WRC05900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which bank charges in this country are comparable to those that exist in other EU jurisdictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":152,"content":"<p>The\u00a0Programme Documents (the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality and the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies) agreed following the 10th Review of the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support included a commitment to carry out an assessment of banks' fee income by end-December 2013 as follows: <\/p><p>The authorities will assess banks' fee income relative to peers in selected other jurisdictions.

The Midlands Fisheries Fund is derived from the midland permits charge paid by anglers and beneficiaries are restricted to the geographic area which this permit charge covers. The Co-op fund is the redistribution of residual funds from the Trout and Coarse Fish Development Societies accounts at the time of their dissolution. It was agreed that Co-op funds would be ring fenced and returned to the areas from which they were generated.

All products used by SEAI&rsquo;s contractors meet appropriate national and international standards and have been tested to the highest standards. The technical specification sets out the materials to be used and the manner by which they are installed by the contractor. It deals extensively with the provision of ventilation in rooms and attic spaces to mitigate the known risks arising during energy upgrades. Further to this SEAI provides technical support to contractors through technical bulletins, on-line and on-site training.<\/p><p>The SEAI operates an inspection programme to ensure that any energy efficient measures installed meet the appropriate technical requirements including ventilation, construction methods and the construction material used. Through this programme a sample of work carried out by registered contractors is routinely inspected. The inspection programme has not shown up any widespread issue of dry rot. When an inspection does show up any specific issues these are dealt with directly with the homeowner and contractor. If any homeowner has a specific concern related to dry rot or any other issue they can contact the SEAI at 1850 927 000 who will examine the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300057#WRG04400","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":352,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300057#WRG04600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":351,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300057#WRG04500"},{"type":"question","counter":352,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[28785\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300057#WRG04600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when he proposes to bring the climate action and low carbon development bill before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.","asker":"1049","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":353,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[28796\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300057#WRG04700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide an update on the publication of the climate action and low carbon development Bill;

As such, the case falls for consideration under Section 13(2) of the Army Pensions Act, 1923, as amended.  It is not possible to fix the amount of the disablement gratuity to be awarded until the outcome of both sets of court proceedings is known.  Therefore, I do not propose to proceed with payment of a disablement gratuity at this time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300058#WRH03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Licensing","counter":403,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300058#WRH03700"},{"type":"question","counter":404,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[28887\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300058#WRH03800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 23 of 18 June 2014, the fact that while Lariam is licensed by the Irish Medicines Board, it also licenses Malarone and Doxycycline, and does not make recommendation regarding which should be used; and if Ireland is following international best practice in this area, the reason we are the only country which uses only Lariam.","asker":"1192","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":405,"content":"<p>The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is the statutory authority with responsibility for the quality, safety and efficacy of <\/p><p>medicines in Ireland. <\/p><p>The Defence Forces Medical Corps is advised that the three anti-malarial medications licensed by the IMB &ndash; Lariam (mefloquine), Malarone and Doxycycline &ndash; can all have significant side effects and protocols are in place to control the risk of side effects in individuals<\/p><p>Each of the three drugs has been used by the Defence Forces, depending on individual circumstances including the type of malaria in the destination, the duration of travel, etc. Where malaria has been identified as a risk in a particular mission area, the choice of chemoprophylaxis is dependent on a number of factors including the type of malaria in the destination, resistance to particular drugs, the profile of the traveller (contra-indications, underlying health conditions, purpose of travel), the duration of travel and adherence issues. The choice of medication is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces on the basis of best international practice having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces. <\/p><p><b>Doxycycline<\/b>has to be taken in the absence of dairy products. It has a daily dosage regime. While it can cause minor but troublesome, mainly gastrointestinal side effects, it can also produce sun-sensitivity skin rashes (akin to severe sun burn) in some individuals.  This is particularly significant when used in very sunny climes.  For this reason it is not recommended for first line use by the Defence Forces in sub-Saharan Africa.  It is, however, the anti-malaria chemoprophylaxis of first choice by the Defence Forces in some geographic regions, e.g. Afghanistan where the predominant malaria species is the Plasmodium Vivax. <\/p><p><b>Malarone<\/b>has a daily dosage regime and up to September 2012, Malarone was only licensed for up to 28 days continuous use and was not an option as the usual duration of deployment for the Defence Forces is 6 months.  The 28-day limit was removed in September 2012.  However, there is limited evidence as to the safety and effectiveness of Malarone usage for longer periods.  On this basis the Defence Forces Policy to use Malarone up to the 27 day limit remains unchanged.<\/p><p><b>Lariam<\/b>is one of the most effective medications for protection against the type of malaria prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and remains the anti-malaria chemoprophylactic agent of choice where the predominant species of malaria is the virulent Plasmodium Falciparum.<\/p><p>I am advised that the Defence Forces follow best international practice in prescribing Lariam. It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability, i.e. a medical risk assessment for Lariam is carried out on an individual basis. This is intended to rule out personnel from overseas service with certain conditions, e.g. depression, anxiety, pregnancy, neurodegenerative disorders etc. which, as has been indicated by the IMB, are more likely to precipitate serious adverse reactions to Lariam.<\/p><p>The former Minister for Defence had the various concerns surrounding the use of Lariam investigated thoroughly and obtained the advice of leading medical experts, who concur with the prescribing practices followed by the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>As I stated previously on 18 June last, Lariam remains licensed by the IMB and must remain in the formulary of medication prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300058#WRH03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":407,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300058#WRH04100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Sick Leave","counter":406,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300058#WRH04000"},{"type":"question","counter":407,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[28822\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300058#WRH04100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will outline in tabular form the total number of sick days taken by staff in his Department in 2011, 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014 further broken down by uncertified, certified and long-term absence leave.","asker":"1101","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":408,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is contained below.

Government decided in July 2013 to extend for another 5 years the existing arrangements whereby there is a limit or 'cap' on the professional indemnity cover held by consultants in respect of their private practice. The Government also decided to adjust the cap annually in line with the Consumer Price Index. <\/p><p>  Under these arrangements, where claims against a consultant working in private practice exceed the agreed limits or caps, the State's Clinical Indemnity Scheme will cover the portion of the claim that exceeds the agreed cap.<\/p><p>  The cap rates to 1 July, 2014 are:<\/p><p>  - for obstetricians, neurosurgeons and orthopaedic surgeons undertaking spinal surgery to &euro;565,000 per claim (including damages and legal costs) subject to annual aggregate limit of &euro;1,695,000 per consultant.<\/p><p>  - for all other specialties, the limit is &euro;1,130,000 per claim (including damages and legal costs) with no aggregate limit. <\/p><p>  The Medical Protection Society (MPS), has increased membership subscription rates in Ireland from the beginning of July, 2014, by an average of 42%.  The main reason cited by the MPS for this is the increased cost of claims in Ireland, relative to the UK.  Departmental officials have met the MPS and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association (IHCA)  in this regard.  The IHCA has requested that further consideration should be given to reducing the caps to reduce the impact of the MPS increases on its members.  <\/p><p>  The State Claims Agency (SCA) has undertaken an actuarial analysis on behalf of my Department to assess the cost to the State of further reduction in the caps.  My Department will work with the SCA to provide a comprehensive brief to the Minister on the Value for Money and also risk assessment of any proposal in this regard.   <\/p><p>  It took months of consideration and assessment before Government agreed in 2013 to the continuation of the caps and in the Government decision on the issue it was stressed that a Value for Money review should be undertaken before any change was made to the caps scheme.   At a time of huge financial pressure on the public system any change to the caps system must be carefully considered and a Government decision would be needed to effect such a change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300060#WRK04000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":522,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300060#WRK04100"},{"type":"question","counter":523,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[28789\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300060#WRK04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will consider arranging a DPT course for the Crumlin-Kimmage area.","asker":"1028","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":524,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300060#WRK04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Services Provision","counter":525,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300060#WRK04400"},{"type":"question","counter":526,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[28791\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300060#WRK04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to any new policy changes in Tallaght hospital accident and emergency where recently some family or friends of loved ones are not being allowed access to the ward.","asker":"1037","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":527,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300060#WRK04600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme Administration","counter":528,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300060#WRK04700"},{"type":"question","counter":529,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[28799\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300060#WRK04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address concerns raised in correspondence (details supplied) regarding the nursing home support scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":530,"content":"<p>The HSE operates a national placement list to enable it to operate within the budget for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.

This report contains a number of recommendations on a range of topics, some particular to specific sectors, including Justice and Education, and others with wider implications. Many of the recommendations, particularly relating to the remit of the Ombudsman for Children have already been implemented, primarily through the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012.<\/p><p>One of the recommendations was to extend the remit of the Ombudsman for Children to complaints in respect of boys detained in St. Patrick's Institution. The Deputy will already be aware that my predecessor, Minister Frances Fitzgerald, made an Order by Statutory Instrument Number 210 of 2012 which took effect on 1st July 2012, in consultation with the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter, to extend the remit for the Ombudsman for Children to include children in detention in St Patrick's Institution.<\/p><p>The Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 primarily addressed the office of the Ombudsman and significantly amended the Ombudsman Act 1980. In the process towards the enactment of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012, my Department worked closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Ombudsman for Children to achieve a significant expansion of the remit of her office. With effect from 1<sup>st<\/sup>May 2013, the bodies within the remit of each Ombudsman and the process for changes to their remits have been greatly expanded and largely aligned.  As a result of amendments contained in sections 4 and 22 of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 any reviewable agency which comes under the remit of the Ombudsman will now automatically come under the remit of the Ombudsman for Children. The First Schedule to the 2012 Act lists all &quot;reviewable agencies&quot; and Part II of that schedule lists the elements of those reviewable agencies that do not come within the remit of the Ombudsman or the Ombudsman for Children. The Second Schedule to that Act lists the &quot;exempt agenices&quot;. Thus the jurisdictions of both offices are aligned and there is legal certainty and clarity on the matter. <\/p><p>Some outstanding recommendations from the above-mentioned reports of March 2012 are being reviewed in conjunction with other Departments and I will consider the need to bring forward legislative proposals in due course, if appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300062#WRM02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":625,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300062#WRM02900"},{"type":"question","counter":626,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[28820\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070300062#WRM03000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his plans to put in place legislation which will compel hospitals to release joint personal information on both the mother and child to the children who were adopted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1099","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":627,"content":"<p>My Department is continuing work on the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of the Bill as soon as possible.
