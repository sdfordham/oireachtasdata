Earlier this month, EU Foreign Ministers approved the establishment of a formal EU-Myanmar Human Rights Dialogue.  The first such Dialogue took place in Myanmar on 20th May.  It was co-chaired by the EU Special Representative for Human Rights and the Myanmar Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and covered major issues of concern with regard to human rights.<\/p><p>  In March, the UN Human Rights Council, of which Ireland is currently a member, adopted an EU-led resolution on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, and urged the Government of Myanmar to step up its efforts to put an end to such remaining human rights violations and abuses.  The resolution reiterated the Council&rsquo;s serious concern about the situation of the Rohingya and other minorities in Rakhine State.  Also in March, the UN called on the Myanmar authorities to fully investigate current and historical human rights violations, and urged the government, with the support of the UN, to put in place a comprehensive protection and service response for survivors.  In April, Ireland was involved in organising with several NGOs an event at UN Headquarters in New York that focused on sexual violence in Myanmar.  It featured interventions from a Burmese woman human rights activist, Naw K&rsquo;nyaw Paw, and Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the UN, David Donoghue.<\/p><p>  Ireland and our international partners recognise that complex challenges remain in Myanmar and will continue to urge its government to address human rights abuses.

I am conscious of the difficulties experienced by Irish citizens who are undocumented in the United States, and have met and spoken with many of them on my working visits there, and also with the various groups who lobby on their behalf. Immigration reform and the challenges faced by our undocumented remain central to our bilateral engagement with the United States.  I raise the issue consistently in my meetings, telephone calls and written correspondence with senior US political contacts.  I have instructed Ambassador Anderson and her team, working with the Irish-American lobby groups who have already put in such a great effort, to continue their lobbying of members of Congress to seize every opportunity to make immigration reform a reality.    <\/p><p>  The issue was also discussed extensively during the Taoiseach&rsquo;s St Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit to Washington DC in March.  In addition to substantive discussion of the issues with President Obama and Vice President Biden, the Taoiseach also discussed the prospects for progress with a range of other members of Congress including Speaker John Boehner; Congressman Bob Goodlatte, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee which has responsibility for immigration legislation in the House; Congressman Paul Ryan; the Congressional Friends of Ireland; and Senator Patrick Leahy, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that oversaw the passage of the Senate&rsquo;s comprehensive immigration reform bill last June.  The Taoiseach called in the strongest possible terms for Congress to show leadership and deal with the immigration issue now.   <\/p><p>    While we have been encouraged by feedback from both Democrats and Republicans indicating that there is now a growing momentum for reform, it remains difficult to assess exactly when and how this might occur, not least in view of the upcoming mid-term U.S. Congressional elections.  The most recent indications suggest that there may be some prospects for another push for immigration reform activity at House of Representatives level during the June\/July period.  However, the situation is continuously evolving and any predictions need to be made with caution.<\/p><p>  In this context, I intend to travel to Washington DC next month for a series of further meetings with key contacts on Capitol Hill as well as with representatives of Irish-American lobby groups.  Although much uncertainty still remains as to how events in the U.S. Congress will unfold, it is important that we continue to demonstrate at a high political level the importance we attach to progress being made on this vital issue and that we position ourselves to best advantage on behalf of Irish people and their families who are directly affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800061#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Issues","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800061#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[23124\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800061#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the increasing tensions in Maghaberry Prison arising from the fact that the agreement which was to be implemented in relation to controlled movement, strip searching and other contentious issues, which gave rise to a 15-month dirty protest two years ago, has not been implemented; if he has conveyed to the Northern Ireland Justice Minister and British Government that these issues have major potential to lead to a destabilisation of the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I also refer the Deputies to the written answers I gave yesterday to Questions Nos. 55 and 64 in relation to these matters.<\/p><p>  If the Deputies wish I can repeat my answer to that question: <\/p><p>  Policing, prisons and overall criminal justice policy have been the responsibility of the Minister of Justice in Northern Ireland, David Ford MLA, since the devolution of Policing and Justice in 2010.  The Irish government has a close and excellent working relationship with Minister Ford and his Department and co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI to combat criminal and terrorist activity is excellent.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs I very much value my engagement with Minister Ford and our exchanges cover a wide range of issues.  Since 2010, the Irish Government&rsquo;s primary responsibility is to ensure the justice systems which are in place are robust and consistent with the principles and values of the Good Friday Agreement and the other agreements for which we are co-guarantors.<\/p><p>  Prison policy forms a central part of the Northern Ireland Department of Justice&rsquo;s remit and an executive agency, the Northern Ireland Prison Service, implements prison policy in that jurisdiction.  A Prisoner Ombudsman is also appointed by Minister Ford and the Ombudsman operates entirely independently of the Northern Ireland Prison Service.  The Prisoner Ombudsman and his team investigate complaints from prisoners and visitors to prisoners in Northern Ireland as well as deaths in custody.  I wholeheartedly agree with Minister Ford&rsquo;s analysis that delivery of a reformed justice system has a major part to play in building a more positive future for Northern Ireland.  I commend the work underway to give effect to the far reaching recommendations related to prison reform in Northern Ireland contained in Dame Anne Owers 2011 report.  The Government&rsquo;s position continues to be that the full implementation of all of the recommendations of the Owers Report remains the most effective way to ensure that conditions within all prisons in Northern Ireland are of an acceptable standard.  Minister Ford and I have discussed this and are of one mind on this matter.<\/p><p>  A central aspect of my engagement with Minister Ford is the Irish government&rsquo;s absolute support for the men and women of the PSNI and the Northern Ireland Prison service in their work to support the rule of law and a new beginning for justice in Northern Ireland.  The men and women in these essential public services face persistent and severe threats to their lives and wellbeing from those who are enemies of the peace process.  People who threaten and have acted to murder harm and threaten police and prison officers act in defiance of the criminal law.  They also defy the sovereign will of the Irish people who freely endorsed the principles and values of Good Friday Agreement in an all island referendum just over 16 years ago on May 22 1998.  I call on all the Irish republicans who try to justify threats against public servants to listen to the people.  It is long since past time to end violence, the door is open to join the rest of us who seek change through dialogue, persuasion and the ballot box.  The Irish people have chosen peace &ndash; you should heed their will. <\/p><p>  As previously indicated in this House, the arrangements agreed for the devolution of Policing and Justice in 2010, include a role for the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in national security matters.  I am aware that such prisoner cases have had resonance historically in communities here and abroad.  My officials in the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat in Belfast continue to monitor prisoner cases which arise from the exercise of such competences.  As the House will know, I have on a number of occasions raised the Government&rsquo;s perspective on humanitarian issues in certain cases directly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  Such issues are part of my regular and comprehensive discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, as we work together to guarantee that peace, policing and  power sharing is supported by all of us, all of the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800061#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800061#WRA01150"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[23217\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800061#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the improvements that have accrued in processing times and overall customer service with the introduction of an appointments structure at the main Dublin Passports Office; and if, in the interests of regional balance, consideration will be given to the establishment of a passport office in County Galway for the western region.

While there were difficulties in holding the elections in Eastern Ukraine owing to the security situation, elsewhere millions of ordinary citizens exercised their democratic right in choosing the future direction of their country.  I hope that this represents an important stage on the path towards the stabilisation of Ukraine and the consolidation of an inclusive, representative and peaceful future.  This hope was reflected in the consideration of Ukraine at the informal meeting of Heads of State or Government held yesterday evening.<\/p><p>I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the constructive role played in the election in Ukraine by the 17 Irish observers who have been deployed under the auspices of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  EU Heads of State and Government on 6 March set out a calibrated, three-phase roadmap in relation to targeted measures against the Russian Federation in the absence of steps to de-escalate the situation.  They also endorsed the decision of Foreign Ministers on 3 March to suspend talks with Russia on visa matters and on a New Agreement, both stated priorities of the Russian Government. <\/p><p>Following the holding of the illegal referendum in Crimea on 16 March, the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) implemented the second phase of measures involving the imposition of travel restrictions and an asset freeze against 21 Russian and Ukrainian individuals involved in undermining Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.  That number has since been progressively increased to 61 individuals, both Russian and Ukrainian.  At the last Foreign Affairs Council on 12 May, in the light of developments and in the absence of steps towards de-escalation, Ministers widened the criteria allowing individuals and entities to be subject to restrictive measures and imposed sanctions for the first time on two energy companies based in Crimea whose ownership has been transferred contrary to Ukrainian law.  Ireland fully supports the carefully targeted and measured approach adopted by the EU and has taken the necessary internal steps to implement the sanctions.    <\/p><p>The May Foreign Affairs Council noted that the preparatory work by the Commission and Member States is underway on possible targeted measures, known as Phase Three measures in the trade and economic spheres, as requested by the European Council in March, so that further steps can be taken should events require.  In that regard, the European Union is paying particular attention to all parties&rsquo; attitude and behaviour towards the holding of free and fair Presidential elections when deciding about possible future measures.  While I very much hope that we will not be faced with an escalation which would necessitate a move to Phase Three, the EU is committed to taking decisive action should it be required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800061#WRA01700","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Syrian Conflict","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800061#WRA01750"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[23176\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800061#WRA01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the way Irish Aid allocated to the crisis in Syria has been spent over the past two years; if he will provide an update on the situation there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

There are now over 9.3 million people within Syria who are in need of immediate life-saving support, and a further 2.8 million Syrian refugees require assistance in neighbouring countries.  The revised UN response plan for Syria and the refugee populations envisages US$6.5 billion dollars in total for operations in 2014, of which approximately 25% has been provided by the international community to date.  This represents the largest humanitarian appeal in the history of the UN.<\/p><p>  Ireland has been to the fore in the international efforts to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis.  In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, I announced Ireland&rsquo;s pledge of a further &euro;12 million in humanitarian assistance at the Second International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria and region in Kuwait on January 15th 2014.  This additional pledge brings Ireland&rsquo;s overall funding commitment in the period 2011 to 2014 to &euro;26.011 million.

Ireland is firmly of the view that Syria&rsquo;s neighbouring states cannot and should not be shouldering the burden of hosting the influx of Syrian refugees alone.  It is for this reason that much of our support has been targeted at supporting both citizens displaced within Syria and refugees across the wider region, as well as to assist the communities hosting refugees in neighbouring states.

I also welcome the decision on 22 May by the UN Security Council Al Qaida Sanctions Committee to impose financial sanctions and an arms embargo on Boko Haram.  The primary responsibility to secure the safe release of the school girls rests with the Nigerian authorities.  I urge the Government of Nigeria to take all appropriate steps to protect their citizens and to ensure that the girls can return safely to their families, and to education.  <\/p><p>  At its meeting in Brussels on 12 May, the EU Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions expressing the EU&rsquo;s concern at the recent terrorist attacks in northern Nigeria and the suffering caused to the population.  The Council strongly condemned the abduction of the schoolgirls and called for their immediate and unconditional release.  It underlined the EU&rsquo;s readiness to support the Nigerian authorities in the resolution of this despicable crime and their ongoing efforts to defeat terrorism in all its forms, in full respect of human rights.  The EU is already supporting the Nigerian authorities to strengthen their capacity to provide security and combat terrorism.  An EU support programme to strengthen the investigation and prosecution of terrorist suspects will begin later this month.  It will include EU technical assistance to counter violent extremism and radicalisation.  <\/p><p>  Our Embassy in Abuja is working closely with our EU partners and others on the ground and maintaining contact with the Nigerian authorities in their efforts to locate and free the missing schoolgirls.  Officials from my Department have also been in contact with the Nigerian Embassy in Dublin to express concern at the ongoing situation and to request regular updates on the actions by the Nigerian authorities to recover the abducted schoolgirls. <\/p><p>  At the most recent session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in March 2014, Ireland highlighted attacks by Boko Haram during discussions with the UN Special Representatives for Violence against Children and Children and Armed Conflict.  Our objective was to draw attention to the ongoing trend of attacks on education around the world and to highlight the importance of ensuring that the right of children to education is upheld during and after conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800061#WRA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":36,"content":"<p>Question No. 20 answered with Question No. 13.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consular Services Provision","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800061#WRA02650"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[23175\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800061#WRA02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he or his Department has received any complaints relating to the operation of Irish embassies or consulates abroad from Irish citizens or otherwise; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

My view is quite simple: Palestinian children should enjoy the same protections under the law which Israel rightly considers appropriate for Israeli children, and in conformity with international standards.<\/p><p>Ireland has repeatedly drawn attention to concerns with regard to the treatment of Palestinian prisoners, including minors.  At the Universal Peer Review of Israel at the UN Human Rights Council in October 2013, Ireland recommended, <i>inter alia<\/i>, that Israel end night arrests of children, the admissibility in evidence in military courts of written confessions in Hebrew signed by Palestinian children, the use of solitary confinement against minors, and the denial of access to family members or to legal representation.

While there were difficulties in holding the elections in Eastern Ukraine owing to the security situation, elsewhere millions of ordinary citizens exercised their democratic right in choosing the future direction of their country.  I hope that this represents an important stage on the path towards the stabilisation of Ukraine and the consolidation of an inclusive, representative and peaceful future.  I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the role played by the 17 Irish observers who have been deployed under the auspices of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  <\/p><p>From the outset, the European Union has played an important role in efforts to facilitate a resolution to the crisis in Ukraine.  In addition to its scheduled meetings, the EU Foreign Affairs Council has met twice in extraordinary session to discuss the situation in Ukraine and the EU Heads of State and Government also have discussed Ukraine in extraordinary session as well as during the regular meetings of the European Council.  The Heads of State and Government discussed the crisis again yesterday evening and considered prospects for progress following Sunday&rsquo;s elections.  <font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font><\/p><p>For its part, the European Commission has also been actively engaged. On 13 May, President Barroso and members of the Commission met with Prime Minister Yatsenyuk and members of the Ukrainian government in Brussels.  As the President of the Commission stated, the joint meeting is part of the EU&rsquo;s continued support for a stable, sovereign, democratic and peaceful Ukraine.  President Barroso and the Prime Minister signed a new &ldquo;State Building Contract&rdquo; programme worth &euro;355 million, plus &euro;10 million to support civil society, which will help the government to address short-term economic stabilisation needs and implement governance reforms aimed at promoting inclusive socio-economic development.  The joint meeting in Brussels was followed up with a visit to Kiev by Commissioner Fule on 16 May.<\/p><p>At its most recent meeting earlier this month, the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) reaffirmed the European Union&rsquo;s support for Ukraine&rsquo;s unity, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and called upon the Russian Federation to do likewise.  The Council reiterated the EU&rsquo;s strong condemnation of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol in March and regretted the presence of President Putin at the military parade in Sevastopol on 9 May.  The FAC reconfirmed the EU&rsquo;s full commitment to the Geneva Joint Statement of 17 April on initial concrete steps to de-escalate tensions and restore security for all.  In light of the recent developments and in the absence of any steps towards de-escalation, the Council agreed to expand the criteria allowing individuals and entities to be subject to restrictive measures and moved to impose sanctions against a further thirteen named individuals as well as two energy companies in Crimea.<\/p><p>The EU has expressed alarm at the continued efforts by pro-Russian separatists to destabilise Eastern and Southern Ukraine and has been clear that it will not recognise the illegitimate and illegal &ldquo;referenda&rdquo; in Donetsk and Luhansk.  The FAC conclusions call for a thorough investigation into the tragic events in Odessa on 2 May and for all those responsible to be brought to justice.  The EU encourages the Ukrainian authorities to maintain their measured approach in pursuing law and order operations and calls on all sides to the conflict to contribute further to reducing tensions. Ireland regrets the loss of all life in Ukraine.<\/p><p>I strongly welcome the beginning of direct intra-Ukrainian talks in the framework of Ukraine&rsquo;s &lsquo;national dialogue&rsquo;.  The first round table took place in Kiev on 14 May with a second round on 17 May in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv.  The series of round tables brings together national lawmakers, government figures and regional officials and is in line with the &lsquo;roadmap&rsquo; proposed by the Swiss Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE.  In common with our EU partners, Ireland hopes that the roundtables can serve to build confidence and lead to a stabilisation of the situation allowing for a negotiated, peaceful and inclusive settlement to the crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800061#WRA03700","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":53,"content":"<p>Question No. 26 answered with Question No. 14.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":54,"content":"<p>Question No. 27 answered with Question No. 19.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid","counter":55,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800061#WRA03950"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[23183\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800061#WRA04000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to reports that South Sudan is at risk of a famine unless the conflict there is resolved, amid reports of a deadly cholera outbreak; and the assistance or support his Department is providing to South Sudan.

New cases have been reported in recent days in two additional States, Jonglei and Upper Nile.  After the first case was confirmed in Juba, more than 130 additional cases are now being treated.  There are three confirmed deaths with dozens of children among the affected.  In response to the cholera outbreak, UNICEF has supported the establishment of a Cholera Treatment Centre at the Juba Teaching Hospital.  It is also providing life-saving supplies, including medicines, protective gear and equipment, and is expanding preventive measures to halt further spread across the country.<\/p><p>  At the recent South Sudan pledging conference in Oslo, Ireland pledged &euro;2million to support life saving work of UN and NGO partners in the country.

I continue to urge all the parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly to engage in constructive discussion with a view to reaching agreement on the substance of a Bill of Rights.  A Bill of Rights drawn up by agreement between the main parties of the Assembly could set out precisely and formally the rights underpinning a reconciled society in Northern Ireland can be based.<\/p><p>I support the establishment of a Civic Forum which would provide for a broad range of voices on community relations and stimulate informed public debate in relation to key societal challenges.  On my regular visits to Northern Ireland, I continue the practice of engaging with civil society representatives.  In the context of the North South Ministerial Council, most recently at our Plenary Meeting on 8 November 2013, the Government expressed support for the re-establishment of the Civic Forum as a valuable and, as yet, unimplemented provision of the Good Friday Agreement.    <\/p><p>I am firmly of the view that an Irish Language Act should be introduced in Northern Ireland.  All parties to the Good Friday Agreement recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity in Northern Ireland.  In the St Andrews Agreement, the British government committed to introducing an Irish Language Act and to working with the Northern Ireland Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish Language.  Since the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland has been a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive and in particular the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms. Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA.  Officials in my Department maintain regular and ongoing contact with the Irish language community in Northern Ireland including those involved in cross-community Irish language activity.  I will continue to press in my discussions with the Northern Ireland Executive the urgent need to address this issue and to legislate for an Irish Language Act.  Officials in my Department will continue to monitor this matter in their ongoing contacts with the Northern Ireland Office. <\/p><p>I met with Dr Haass on 23 May when he visited Dublin after his visit to London on 22 May.  We share the view that progress in the Party Leaders Talks is urgently needed.  I remain convinced that the best way forward for dealing with important issues such as parades, flag and identity issues and dealing with the past is the early, successful conclusion of these talks.  Maintaining the status quo in relation to these issues is not a feasible or satisfactory option for anyone.  I believe that there is a window of opportunity to reach agreement before the summer and I will continue to encourage the NI parties over the coming weeks towards that end.  The British and the US government agree progress on these issues is needed urgently.<\/p><p>Progress in these talks is primarily a matter for the Party Leaders.  However, the Irish government continues to encourage and support this process in every possible way.  I have remained in close contact with the Secretary of State, Ms Theresa Villiers, with regard to full implementation of the Agreements as well as further progress towards an agreement in the political talks.  I will meet the Secretary of State tomorrow when she is scheduled to visit Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800062#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":73,"content":"<p>Question No. 36 answered with Question No. 19.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800062#WRB00850"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[23490\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800062#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which prisoners are held or detained by the Israeli authorities, Fatah or Hamas, if their detention complies with international human rights norms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Immigration reform and the challenges faced by our undocumented remain central to our bilateral engagement with the United States.  I raise the issue consistently in meetings, telephone calls and written correspondence with senior US political contacts.

The Taoiseach called in the strongest possible terms for Congress to show leadership and deal with the immigration issue now.   <\/p><p>    While we have been encouraged by feedback from both Democrats and Republicans indicating that there is now a growing momentum for reform, it remains difficult to assess exactly when and how this might occur, not least in view of the upcoming mid-term U.S. Congressional elections.

For example, in the period 2007-2013, over &euro;30 million pre-accession assistance has been provided to enhance the capacity of such institutions as national parliamentary assemblies, ombudsmen and national audit bodies.

As part of the handover of responsibility, Revenue received the HHC database from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) and carried out a comprehensive data matching exercise with its own LPT Property Register.  The data matching exercise produced a list of properties in respect of which the HHC did not appear to be paid.<\/p><p>  Once the 'unpaid' cases were identified, Revenue announced a compliance campaign including a six week window to 31 March to allow people get both their HHC and LPT affairs in order.  The six week window included a commitment that interest and penalties would not be applied against any person who met their obligations during that timeframe.  The window and the consequences of continued non-compliance were very extensively advertised on both national and local media outlets and many people availed of the opportunity to bring their property tax affairs up to date. <\/p><p>  On 17 April 2014, Revenue began writing to the owners of approximately 274,000 properties who did not bring their affairs up to date during the six week window.  The notices clearly warned of the consequences of continued non-compliance and outlined the steps that needed to be taken in regard to making payment or updating the records where no payment was due on foot of exemptions\/waivers.  Since assuming responsibility for HHC Revenue has received payments in respect 112,000 properties, of which 102,000 were received since the compliance programme started.  Revenue has also received in excess of 70,000 items of correspondence since the compliance programme started, of which approximately 30,000 remain to be answered. <\/p><p>  Revenue expects to have the correspondence backlog cleared in the next few weeks and be in a position to commence debt recovery action against property owners who have still not paid at that point.  The actions to be deployed will include mandatory deduction from employment income for PAYE workers, or from occupational pensions or certain Government payments where appropriate.  Actions applicable in the case of self-assessed taxpayers, some of which have already been deployed,\u00a0include withholding of Tax Clearance certification, surcharges on Income Tax, Corporation Tax and Capital Gains Tax returns and withholding\/offset of any other tax refunds.

If both cohabitants earn in excess of the standard rate band (i.e. &euro;32,800), then they both pay tax at 41% on any income in excess of &euro;32,800.\u00a0 Married couples or couples in a civil partnership where both individuals work get the same treatment.  The difference between the two groups in relation to income tax is the ability of married couples or civil partners to transfer certain tax credits such as the personal\/married credits and part of the tax bands, i.e. the tax band of &euro;65,600 available to married couples or couples in a civil partnership with two incomes in 2013 is transferable between spouses up to a maximum of &euro;41,800.\u00a0 This is of benefit where one of the individuals earns less than the 20% tax threshold of &euro;32,800 or where one of the individuals has no income.<\/p><p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage.\u00a0 Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800063#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800063#WRC01700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Autism Support Services","counter":129,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800063#WRC01650"},{"type":"question","counter":130,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[23439\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800063#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the State's current statutory obligations in relation to the provision of educational services for children and young adults clinically diagnosed with autism and Asperger's syndrome; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

That mandate includes Irish interests.  Since negotiations began formally in July last year, there have been five formal negotiating rounds, the latest of which took place last week in the US.  <\/p><p>  This is a comprehensive yet complex negotiating project.  Despite five Rounds of talks having taken place, discussions are still at a comparatively early stage.  While all aspects of trade and investment will be covered, it is very early in the process to say specifically what might finally emerge from the talks and the related implications for Ireland.  What we do know is that the negotiations with the United States are aimed at eliminating tariffs, solving existing regulatory barriers that increase business costs, working to avoid the imposition of unnecessary regulatory barriers in the future, and opening new market opportunities for exporters in both economies.  I expect that any progress on these will be in Ireland's long term interests and Irish companies should have easier, wider and less costly access to the US market.<\/p><p>  As most of the potential gains from TTIP will arise from regulatory convergence and mutual recognition of the regulatory regimes on both sides of the Atlantic, to the extent that it is possible, Irish business and especially SMEs should benefit from lower regulatory compliance costs.  All of this will provide significant opportunities for Irish businesses to increase their U.S. sales or enter the American market for the first time, as well as reducing the cost of consumer or industrial goods that we import.  I know from my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, that in addition to challenges, there is huge potential opportunity in TTIP for the agrifood sector.  Right across the range of issues covered by TTIP, I will ensure we are best positioned to make the most from these and other trade and investment opportunities.<\/p><p>  We are engaging in detailed analysis of specific opportunities and impacts for Ireland which informs our input to the ongoing negotiations.

There is no specific gender requirement for such an application and someone receiving an IQA can be either a man or a woman.  Generally, persons in respect of whom IQA payments may be claimed are free to claim a social welfare payment in their own right.  For example, where a person of working age is a qualified adult on their spouse's jobseeker's benefit or allowance claim that person may claim jobseeker's benefit or allowance in their own right.

This will be achieved by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses.  For example:<\/p><p>- Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps.  Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4m addresses by 2016. #<\/p><p>- UPC has invested over &euro;500m in upgrading its cable network.  Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps.  Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps. <\/p><p>- ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure.  It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage.  The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>- Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg's multiband spectrum auction.  There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements. <\/p><p>- Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband. <\/p><p>- The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.<\/p><p>Of the estimated 2.3m premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years.  This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched.  While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns.  The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>On 25 April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment under the National Broadband Plan.  This commitment is a clear expression of Government's determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.  Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network.  It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users.  The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities.  The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out.  This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway.  Further locations may be identified as this process continues.  Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention.  Currently I envisage that a total of 28 areas in County Offaly will be included in the proposed fibre build-out.  The list is available on my Department's website .  In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre rollout may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive. <\/p><p>Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention. A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised.  It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in the areas that require intervention as quickly as possible. <\/p><p>I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas.  I intend to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component.  In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21<sup>st<\/sup>century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800064#WRD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Semi-State Bodies","counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800064#WRD03150"},{"type":"question","counter":210,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[23510\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800064#WRD03200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the current credit rating of all commercial semi-State bodies operating under the aegis of his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

An exemption from the Local Property Tax applies to developments listed in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013.

To date, &euro;3.3m has been drawn down. Local Authorities have been advised that the deadline for receipt of any new applications for PSI funding is 30 May 2014.   <\/p><p>To assist further in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments, Budget 2014 contained a special provision, in the form of a targeted &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF).  The SRF is designed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer\/owner\/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers.  It was envisaged that the SRF be particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax exemption, as in a seriously problematic condition. <\/p><p>In December 2013, my Department wrote to local authorities seeking proposals for funding support under the SRF and the deadline for receipt of applications was 28 February 2014. All submissions have now been evaluated by my Department in accordance with the criteria circulated to local authorities<i>.<\/i>On 2 May 2014, I announced SRF allocations to 86 housing developments across the country.  Further information is available at the following weblink:<\/p><p>.  This public investment will leverage an additional &euro;12m from third parties (developers\/lenders\/bonds) which will be invested in these estates.  It is hoped that the SRF will enable very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible.   <\/p><p>There are no plans to revise the list of developments included in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013, either by removing or adding developments to it, at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800065#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Meters Installation","counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800065#WRE00450"},{"type":"question","counter":220,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[23447\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800065#WRE00500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the position regarding water meters (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":221,"content":"<p>The <i>Programme for Government<\/i>sets out a commitment to the introduction of water charges based on usage above a free allowance.

The scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the presiding judge who are under the Constitution independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the primary objective for the Service is to maintain the delivery of front line court sittings and services.  The Courts Service continuously works to support the judiciary and assist in ensuring that cases are dealt with as effectively and as speedily as possible.  Available resources and operational and organisational structures are kept under  review to ensure that resources are targeted and focussed on keeping waiting times in the provision of services to a minimum.  The increased monetary jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts which came into effect in February 2014 should ultimately lead to reduced legal costs for individuals and companies involved in litigation.  Other efficiency measures are currently being examined such as extending e-filing which is currently available for small claims and personal insolvency applications and will become available for debt claims when the necessary supporting legislation is in place.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Legal Aid Board grants legal aid to persons on foot of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 to take and defend court proceedings.  The authorisation is by way of a legal aid certificate and the majority of certificate types require payment of a financial contribution for the certificate to be effective.  An authorisation is only granted if the Board is satisfied that the case meets the 'merits' tests that are set out in the aforementioned legislation.  The minimum contribution is &euro;130 and most cases are assessed at the minimum payment.  There is a facility to apply to reduce or waive the contribution where not to do so would cause hardship.  There are certain case types, notably the defence of applications by the Child and Family Agency regarding children, where no payment is required. Once the certificate is signed and the contribution is discharged, representation is provided.<\/p><p>In addition, the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, which has completed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and which I expect to commence Report Stage in June, gives legislative expression to the commitment in the Programme for Government to <i>&quot;establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints&quot;.  <\/i>The Bill makes extensive provision, in Part 10, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged by legal practitioners, along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients.  Legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients.  This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions.  Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in section 117 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not reasonably practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated.  A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client.  When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question.  An aggrieved client also has the option of applying for the taxation of disputed legal costs by the Office of the Taxing-Master.  Under the Legal Services Regulation Bill the current functions of the Taxing-Master will be taken over by the new and modernised Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators.<\/p><p>I would expect that, along with those other cost-cutting measures being introduced by the Government in relation to legal services, the new legal costs regime set out in the Bill will help reduce such costs and their impact on clients and will increase access to justice for citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800065#WRE03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":267,"content":"<p>Question No. 106 answered with Question No. 102.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Complaints Procedures","counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800065#WRE03850"},{"type":"question","counter":269,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[23431\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800065#WRE03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding an assault.

Notwithstanding the existing financial pressures, the Government is fully committed to ensuring the on-going delivery of services and supports to children and adults with disabilities, including those with ASD.  The HSE has been provided with funding in the order of &euro;1.4 billion in 2014 to fund its disability services programme for children and adults with disabilities, including those with ASD.  Services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers and a range of statutory, non-statutory, voluntary and community groups.   <\/p><p>Services provided include assessment, diagnosis and ongoing treatment and intervention supports.  These may include home support services, respite services and multi-disciplinary team supports to assess the individual needs of each person with ASD and provide for the appropriate interventions.  Part 2 of the Disability Act, 2005, also provides for an Assessment of Need process, which at present encompasses younger children.  This process provides for the needs of eligible applicants, occasioned by their disability, to be assessed within specific timeframes.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive's <i>National Review of Autism Services: Past, Present and Way Forward Report<\/i>(2012) and its <i>National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years)<\/i>set out the overall policy context for the provision of autism services to children and young people.  The objective of the Progressing Children's Disability Services Programme is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services.  This Programme aims to ensure greater equity in accessing services, based on need, clearer referral pathways to these services and improved collaboration between the relevant sectors.  An additional &euro;4m has been specifically allocated in 2014 to drive implementation of the Programme.  This equates to approximately 80 therapy posts.  In addition, the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has been examining issues around autism across Government Departments, in association with the National Disability Authority (NDA).  This work by the NDA, which has included consultation with families, will be of significant assistance in informing how best to address the needs of people with ASD in order to ensure that they are appropriately reflected and included in policies and actions. <\/p><p>With regard to access to redress in general terms, the Health Act 2004, provides that all service users of the HSE have the right to make a complaint where they believe that the standards of care, treatment or practice fall short of what is acceptable.  More information in relation to this complaints process is available on the HSE's website, .  In terms of seeking redress in relation to unmet statutory obligations, under the Disability Act, 2005, applicants for the Assessment of Need process have access to a dedicated redress system consisting of a complaints process to a designated Complaints Officers and an onward appeal to an independent Disability Appeals Officer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800066#WRF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"question","counter":297,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[23440\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052800066#WRF01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the resources that are available on a Health Service Executive regional basis to families who have children or members diagnosed with autism; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Under the legislation, determination of an individual's eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE.  The 1970 Health Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and their family, having regard to their overall financial situation and reasonable expenditure.  The legislation is clear that qualification for a medical card is means-tested.  Medical cards are not awarded - nor have they ever been - on the basis of a particular illness or disease.  Medical cards are not issued 'automatically' - or irrespective of means - even if an applicant is suffering from a serious medical condition or a life long condition. <\/p><p>  While there is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with specific illnesses, or with a disability, the HSE has discretion to award a medical card to avoid undue hardship, having regard to person's or the family's overall financial situation, even where the person's income exceeds the income guidelines.  The HSE is obliged to operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Health Act, while also responding to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card.  As I have outlined, the 1970 Act established a financial means assessment and medical card eligibility is granted on the basis of the financial situation of the applicant.  The nature of a disease or illness an applicant may have is not the basis for granting eligibility and I can assure the Deputy that all applicants are treated in a standard, uniform manner.<\/p><p>  The HSE is currently examining how individuals, who are not entitled to a medical card, could still receive services that meet their needs.

My Department has no responsibility in relation to the sustainability of the creche at Tallaght hospital or any other individual childcare service. <\/p><p>  The recent enactment through the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 of amendments to the Child Care Act 1991 underpins a number of key reforms being introduced as part of the Pre-School Quality Agenda.

New National Quality Standards will also be published.  It is not intended to impose any additional costs on services as a result of the new regulations, other than an increase in the annual fee payable by services to the Early Years Inspectorate.  In the case of the service in question, the increase in the fee payable is expected to be in the region of &euro;80 per annum.<\/p><p>  My Department has introduced measures to support training for childcare staff to enable them to upskill to meet the increased qualification requirements and &euro;3 million is being made available over the next two years for this initiative.

In cases where reductions in levels of service are implemented by funded organisations, the Child and Family Agency expects that service users are provided with information about other available supports, including alternative sexual violence support services in the region and the 24 hour helpline provided by Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.
