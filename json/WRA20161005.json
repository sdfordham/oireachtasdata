The Action Plan, published on 19 July 2016, aims to deliver 47,000 units of social housing over the period to 2021 through construction, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, supported by Exchequer investment of some &euro;5.35 billion. <\/p><p>The Plan also provides for early solutions to address the unacceptable level of families in emergency accommodation, including the objective that by mid-2017, hotels will only be used for emergency accommodation in very limited circumstances.  The increases in Rent Supplement and Housing Assistance Payment levels from 1 July 2017, in terms of supporting families to remain in rented accommodation, will play an important role in the achievement of this overall objective.  However where families do find themselves in a homeless situation their needs will be met through the enhanced Housing Assistance Payment, general social housing allocations, as well as by the additional housing supply to be delivered through an expanded Rapid-Build housing programme and a Housing Agency initiative to acquire 1,600 vacant housing units.<\/p><p>The Action Plan also outlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensure that services are fully responsive to the particular needs that might arise for families with dependents that are residing in emergency accommodation with a number of measures to be overseen by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  These measures include the appointment of a Dedicated Child Support Worker, assistance by Home School Community Liaison and School Completion staff, and access to cr&egrave;ches and preschool services. <\/p><p>Also contained in the Plan is a cross-Government action to ensure that young people leaving State care and at risk of homelessness are identified and catered for through appropriate housing and other supports appropriate for their needs.

The majority of this funding is to support ongoing rental payments to landlords in respect of existing HAP households and the cost of additional HAP tenancies as households find accommodation through the scheme during the year.  Funding also includes the operational costs of the HAP Shared Service Centre, which provides a central transactional service for all local authorities where HAP is operational, and the costs of the HAP administrative payment made to local authorities operating the scheme.<\/p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government committed to extending the capacity of local authorities to make discretionary payments, while providing a framework for the review of both Rent Supplement and Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) rent limits taking account of geographic variations in market rents.

Furthermore, additional flexibility above the existing HAP rent limits was made available to all HAP local authorities from the same date.

Following on from the setting of establishment day, it is intended that the phased commencement of the remaining Parts of the 2015 Act will be implemented over the remainder of this year - with some carry-over anticipated into early 2017 in relation to major undertakings such as the start-up of the Authority&rsquo;s critical public complaints function.  The current implementation period will, therefore, include the phased commencement of Parts of the 2015 Act such as those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the Roll of Practising Barristers and Pre-Action Protocols.  Following this, the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced.  The various legal costs provisions and Chapters of Part 10 of the 2015 Act are very much interlinked and will, therefore, be key to the overall success of the phased commencement of the Act over the coming period.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500074#WRG01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Controls","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500074#WRG01750"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[28861\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500074#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason for the delay in processing an application (details supplied) made for a visa under the de facto partnership scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned made an application for De Facto Partner Permission.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>The total strength of the Donegal Garda Division on the 31 August 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 387 with 23 Reserve Garda&iacute;.  The detailed information requested on the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Donegal Garda Division by District, on the 31 December 2008 and 2010, and on the 31 August 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is set out in the table.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers.  Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014 and start recruiting again.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the<font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to<\/font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000 and to double the Garda Reserve.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 14 of these have been assigned to Donegal.  Another 150 will attest later this year and will be assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Divisional policing, and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream.<\/p><p>The &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; also includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures.  Reserve members have undergone training in many of the skills required to be an effective full-time member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is important that we build on the very real contribution that they are making to the policing of communities right across the country. <\/p><p>I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner in relation to the delivery of this commitment and what steps might be taken to ensure that the  expanded Reserve is used to best effect in support of visible policing.  In this regard, I welcome the recent assignment by the Commissioner of a Superintendent to head up the Garda Reserve Management Office.  I understand that Office is currently undertaking an audit of the experience and skills of Reserves which, when completed, will assist Garda management in considering the future role to be played by the Reserve.  It has also started work on the development of a recruitment plan with the objective of recruiting and training 300 new Reserves annually, starting next year, to bring the strength of the Reserve up from its current strength of 789 members to 2,000. <table><tr><th colspan=\"5\">Strength of Donegal Garda Division<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Districts<\/td><td>31\/12\/2008<\/td><td>31\/12\/2010<\/td><td>31\/08\/2016<\/td><td>Reserve<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Letterkenny<\/td><td>191<\/td><td>175<\/td><td>156<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Buncrana<\/td><td>91<\/td><td>80<\/td><td>70<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Milford<\/td><td>56<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>66<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Glenties<\/td><td>57<\/td><td>58<\/td><td>*<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ballyshannon<\/td><td>93<\/td><td>99<\/td><td>95<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TOTAL<\/td><td>488<\/td><td>466<\/td><td>387<\/td><td>23<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*The amalgamation of the Glenties District took place on the 11<sup>th<\/sup>November, 2013 which resulted in the Glenties District being apportioned between Ballyshannon and Milford Districts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500075#WRH00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":204,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500075#WRH00900"},{"type":"question","counter":205,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[28906\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500075#WRH01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to reopen any of the Garda stations closed within the Donegal division due to cutbacks since 2010; the need to do so in order to strengthen community policing and combat rural crime; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1289","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":206,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[28907\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500075#WRH01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to re-establish the former Glenties district headquarters following its amalgamation by the previous Government with two other districts within the Donegal division; the need to do so in order to strengthen the policing of west and south west Donegal; if she will provide a stronger rural-based policing service to the persons and rural communities of west Donegal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1289","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[28911\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500075#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to provide a new Garda station for Donegal town, as the present station is in need of replacement and plans for a new station have been long promised; if a site has been identified; if plans have been agreed and drawn up regarding this new facility; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1289","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[28912\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500075#WRH01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans for Dunkineely Garda station in the Donegal division and her plans for policing in the Dunkineely Garda station area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1289","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":209,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88, 89, 93 and 94 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the Office of Public Works has primary responsibility for the provision and refurbishment of Garda accommodation and I, as Minister, have no direct role in these matters.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a major refurbishment of Donegal Town Garda station is envisaged under the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016 &ndash; 2021.  In this context, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Office of Public Works has developed proposals to extend and refurbish Donegal Town Station and these proposals are currently being considered by local Garda management.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that some 139 Garda stations, including Dunkineely, were closed on foot of the Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme, which was implemented in 2012 and 2013, following the completion by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of a comprehensive review of its district and station network.  As the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources at her disposal, the review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation.  It concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation&rsquo;s resource base would best meet public demand.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the closures have allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  <\/p>  <p>  With respect to the reopening of stations, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that community policing is the embodiment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, providing a means of recognising that every community, both urban and rural, has its own concerns and expectations.  It commits the Government to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing in every community, including the most minimal response times possible.  Under the Programme, the Government is committed to asking the Policing Authority to oversee a review of, amongst other things, both the boundaries of Garda districts and the dispersement of Garda stations in rural areas and I have asked the Authority to initiate the proposed review.  I have previously informed the House that I intend to put the outcome of the review before the House.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme also commits the Government to launching a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.

This represents a dramatic improvement in turnaround times for the processing of vetting applications in recent years, falling from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013.  This improvement has come about as a result of an unprecedented investment by the Government and the Garda Authorities in providing this service, including an increase of over 80 percent in staffing levels and the roll out earlier this year of an e-vetting system.<\/p>  <p>  In April this year I commenced the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 and in tandem with that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched the e-vetting system.  E-vetting facilitates the online processing of applications and this has significantly streamlined the vetting process and contributed to a sustained reduction in processing times for vetting applications.  I am informed that at present 85% of organisations registered for vetting are operating the e-vetting system and the Garda Authorities are working to encourage all other organisations to do so.<\/p>  <p>  One very important feature of the e-vetting system is that the individual applicant can track the progress of their own vetting application online and can, therefore, see when their application has been processed and returned to the relevant registered organisation.<\/p>  <p>  For those vetting applications that continue to be submitted in paper format, the average turnaround time is in the order of four weeks from the receipt of the application by the Vetting Bureau and this represents a minimum timeframe given the administrative input required.<\/p>  <p>  Processing times for applications can be longer in some individual cases when, for example, additional enquiries may be necessary or where errors have been made in the application.  It is important to note that delays can also occur in other aspects of the application process which are outside of the control of the Garda Authorities, for example, in the submission or return of applications by the registered organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the vetting service is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account the importance of protecting children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, the current processing period is not unreasonable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500075#WRH01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Accommodation Provision","counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500075#WRH01800"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[28909\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500075#WRH01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans for providing a new courthouse building for Donegal town, given that the current building is in need of replacement and not fit for purpose; her further plans and a site location for the new facility; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1289","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts, including the provision of accommodation for court sittings, is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions.<\/p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that at present there are no plans for a new courthouse in Donegal town.

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:  <\/p>  <p>  -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;<\/p>  <p>  -  be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;<\/p>  <p>  -  be without both hands or without both arms; <\/p>  <p>  -  be without one or both legs;<\/p>  <p>  -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;<\/p>  <p>  -  have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. <\/p>  <p>  The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Scheme.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.<\/p>  <p>  The Medical Board of Appeal's clinical determination is limited to the scope of the six qualifying criteria, and the Board does not have discretion in relation to the application of these criteria.  The criteria to qualify for the Scheme are necessarily precise and specific.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;50.3 million to the Exchequer in 2015, an increase from &euro;48.6 million in 2014.  These figures do not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities.  I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500076#WRJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Reductions","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500076#WRJ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[28880\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500076#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will support the promotion of modernised technology and safety features in Irish vehicles by lowering the cost of vehicle maintenance and lowering the VAT rate from 13.5% to 12%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.

These figures are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2014, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.  They are estimated by reference to projected 2017 incomes. They are provisional and may be revised.  <\/p>  <p>  In the event that I make no change to the entry threshold for USC in the Budget, it is estimated that 748,000 individuals would be exempt from USC in 2017 on the basis that their USC-liable income would be below &euro;13,000.<\/p>  <p>  While step effects are never ideal, they are often a feature of tax systems with exemption thresholds, as the application of a tax on this basis allows those with incomes below the threshold to be supported by means of the exemption, while also achieving the required yield from the tax.  The Deputy may be aware that both the Income Levy and the Health Levy, which were replaced by the USC, also had step effects.  The Health Levy in particular had a significant step effect of &euro;1,040 per annum, or &euro;20 per week, when weekly earnings exceeded &euro;500.<\/p>  <p>  PRSI also had a step effect for employees which existed for many years, and which was a significant issue for workers earning just over the PRSI entry threshold of &euro;352 per week.  The Deputy will be aware that I addressed this issue in Budget 2016 through the introduction of a new tapered PRSI Credit, which took effect from 1 January this year.  This credit smoothes entry into the PRSI system for employees on lower incomes, without providing an additional benefit to higher income-earners.<\/p>  <p>  As the USC step occurs at a lower income threshold and a low tax rate, its effect is much less significant than the steps of the two levies it replaced.  In 2015, the USC step was just over &euro;180 annually, or &euro;3.46 per week.  The Deputy will be aware that in Budget 2016 I reduced the two lower rates of USC by a half of one percent each with effect from 1 January this year.  Therefore, notwithstanding the increase in the USC exemption threshold to &euro;13,000, Budget 2016 actually reduced the USC step to under &euro;150, or &euro;2.88 per week.<\/p>  <p>  As regards future measures, in the Programme for Partnership Government there is a commitment to ask the Oireachtas to continue to phase out the Universal Social Charge (USC) as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, reduces excessive tax rates for middle income earners, and limits the benefit for high earners.  Reductions will be introduced on a fair basis with an emphasis on low and middle income earners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500076#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Promotion","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500076#WRJ02300"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[28834\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500076#WRJ02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will maintain the support and growth of the Irish tourism industry by ensuring the 9% VAT rate is sustained; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":244,"content":"<p>The 9% reduced VAT rate for tourism related services was introduced in July 2011 as part of the Government Jobs Initiative.

The objective was to boost tourism and create additional jobs.  While the VAT rate was due to revert to 13.5% in 2014, I retained the 9% rate on tourism activity in Budget 2014 because the initiative had proved to be a major success.  Between the second quarter of 2011 and first quarter of 2016, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the number of people working in the Accommodation &amp;amp; Food Services Sector nationally increased by 31,000, taking total employment from 114,900 to 145,900.

Consequently, while I have decided not to\u00a0\u00a0reconstitute the Motor Insurance Advisory Board at this time, I have instead established a Cost of Insurance Working Group\u00a0chaired by Minister of State Eoghan Murphy T.D.. This Working Group consists of a number of relevant Government Departments, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the State Claims Agency.The objective of the Review is to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector.\u00a0<\/p><p>The core areas to be examined by the Working Group in the first phase are: <\/p><p>- The motor insurance sector generally, at present and in recent years <\/p><p>- The effects of legal costs and litigation processes on insurance costs <\/p><p>- The current claims compensation arrangements and the cost of claims<\/p><p>- Insurance data and information <\/p><p>- The impact of accident rates <\/p><p>- The impact of unlawful activity on the insurance sector, and <\/p><p>- Other market issues<\/p><p>A number of additional issues which impact upon consumers and the business sector in relation to motor insurance are also being considered.  These include: <\/p><p>- The lack of a link between the National Car Test and the availability of insurance,<\/p><p>-  Insurance costs for young drivers, and those over 65,<\/p><p>- The case for rural dwellers with no public transport to have car insurance at a reasonable cost, <\/p><p>- The issue of returning immigrants having difficulty obtaining car insurance,<\/p><p>- The cost of insurance to taxi drivers, hackneys and hauliers. <\/p><p>- The issue of insurance companies denying coverage to cars over 10 years or older.<\/p><p>Because the issue of the cost of insurance is complex and in order to get to the heart of these issues as soon as possible, Minister of State Eoghan Murphy T.D. has established four sub-groups to review them in detail. Chairs have been appointed to these sub-groups and work has already commenced. The sub-groups are meeting weekly and their outputs will feed into the meetings of the Working Group. The Working Group has held five meetings to date and will continue to meet every two to three weeks to the end of 2016.<\/p><p>The consultation process has commenced. Minister of State Murphy has had informal meetings with representatives from a number of key stakeholders including: Insurance Ireland, AA Ireland, the Injuries Board, the Irish Brokers Association, IBEC, FBD Insurance, and the Central Bank of Ireland. The Working Group and the four sub-groups are also meeting with the relevant stakeholders. The Working Group has met with representatives from the Law Society, AA Ireland, the Irish Brokers Association, the Irish Car Rental Council, the Irish Road Haulage Association and the Consumers Association of Ireland. Further consultations will be arranged. In addition, submissions received from all interested parties will be considered as part of the process.<\/p><p>By the end of October, the Working Group will provide\u00a0me with an update report which will set out the priority actions required. From November to December, the Working Group will then develop an action plan to enable the relevant Government Departments and Offices to commence the implementation of these priority actions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500077#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Betting Legislation","counter":261,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500077#WRK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":262,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[28954\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500077#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of licences which have been issued since the commencement of the Betting (Amendment) Act on foot of that Act; if a list of those licences issued can be provided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[28960\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500077#WRK01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of receipts from traditional betting tax from 2000 to date on an annual basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":264,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[28961\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500077#WRK02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide details of receipts for betting duty in the areas of traditional, remote and commissions, from the commencement of remote betting duty in August 2015 to August 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":265,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 to 110, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The table provided to me by Revenue sets out the number of licences issued from the commencement of the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 to 30 September 2016.<table><tr><th>Licence Category<\/th><th>Numbers Issued<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Bookmaker's Licence<\/td><td>316<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Remote Bookmaker's Licence<\/td><td>50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Remote Betting Intermediary's Licence<\/td><td>11<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Lists of current licence holders are updated monthly and published on the Revenue website at the following link:<i> <\/i><\/p><p>I am further informed by Revenue that the receipts from traditional betting tax from 2000 to September 2016 are as follows:<table><tr><th>Betting Tax Receipts<\/th><th>&euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2000<\/td><td>58.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2001<\/td><td>68.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2002<\/td><td>48.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2003<\/td><td>38.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2004<\/td><td>45.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2005<\/td><td>45.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2006<\/td><td>54.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>36.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>36.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>31.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>30.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>27.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>27.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>25.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>26.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>27.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016 (Jan to Sep)<\/td><td>21.2<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>I am also informed by Revenue that the returns and payments in respect of Betting Duty are due on a quarterly basis, in the month following the quarter end.

The role of the Group is to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the EGFSN and to provide a forum for on-going collaboration in addressing the skills needs of the sector and to identify and progress actions to overcome barriers on its implementation.<\/p>  <p>  The Group has met several times since it was established and a number of key actions are being progressed including an audit of courses and culinary facilities within both the Further and Higher education sectors with a view to obtaining a complete overview of existing courses and facilities, with a view to identifying gaps in provision and encouraging collaboration and sharing of facilities where possible.<\/p>  <p>  Since the EGFSN study has been carried out, new developments in providing for the skill needs of the sector have included: <\/p>  <p>  - Approximately 220 free hospitality-related higher education places under the 2016 Springboard+ programme. <\/p>  <p>  - A proposal to develop a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship is at an advanced stage and is due to commence in the coming months, with training courses taking place in Education and Training Boards (ETBs) along with a work placement component.<\/p>  <p>  - A proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship has been approved for development funding by the Apprenticeship Council at its last meeting in September. <\/p>  <p>  - New Career Traineeships in Hospitality are being rolled out by a number of ETBs on a pilot basis with over 100 participants engaging so far. These are shorter courses, typically of up to 12 months duration.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Skillnets Limited is\u00a0 scoping opportunities to establish a dedicated network to serve the needs of the sector and has held a series of meetings with representatives of the industry.<\/p>  <p>  The skill needs of the hospitality sector will also be addressed through\u00a0the new skills architecture established under the Government&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy 2025, which includes the 9 Regional Skills Fora. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500078#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Eligibility","counter":279,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500078#WRL01100"},{"type":"question","counter":280,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[28857\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500078#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the proposals he has to reduce the distance criteria in respect of qualification for the non-adjacent maintenance grant for higher education; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the reduced distance qualification has impacted most severely on lower income families; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":281,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that Budget 2011 provided for a number of student grant measures, which came into effect for the 2011\/12 academic year, including the change in the assessment of the qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of grant from 24 kilometres to 45 kilometres. <\/p>  <p>  The 24km distance criterion was originally set in 1968 and had not been updated in more than 40 years.

This therefore includes a mix of units from the existing housing stock and newly built units.  Overall, it is estimated that around 4,700 units could be secured for social housing from Part V agreements. \u00a0However, the final delivery will ultimately depend on many factors, including activity in the private sector, capacity of local authorities and approved housing bodies and readiness of projects.<\/p><p>Information on social housing units purchased in respect of all local authorities funded by direct capital investment by my Department is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <\/p><p>Data in relation to 2016 are currently being collated and will be published shortly.

The low rates of vacant units of 1-2% recorded in 2016 is a strong indication that the local authorities, through the additional provision of funding provided by my Department&rsquo;s Vacant Social Housing Programme, have substantially addressed the back log that had accumulated pre-2014.

For unaccompanied minors, there will be specific accommodation arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  President Hollande said that the objectives of these actions are to &ldquo;guarantee the security of the people of Calais, to maintain public order and to ensure for the migrants and refugees that conditions are dignified&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that persons who are currently in another EU Member State - including those in the camps in Calais - and who are in need of international protection, are entitled to make an application for asylum in that country, should they wish to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the humanitarian crisis that developed in Southern Europe as a consequence of mass migration from areas of conflict in the Middle East and Africa.  In announcing the IRPP, the Government recognised the importance of prioritising family groups and in addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  A significant number of those who have arrived to date are children with one or two parents.  With regard to unaccompanied minors Ireland has formally indicated to Greece its desire to accept unaccompanied minors under the relocation mechanism and we now have a commitment from the Greek authorities that Ireland will be receiving the first group of unaccompanied minors later this year.<\/p>  <p>  Matters relating to Asylum and Refugees in Calais are a matter for France in the first instance, acting in conformity with applicable EU agreements and processes, and I have confidence in the French authorities to manage this issue.<\/p>  <p>  Of course I share the concerns expressed by the Deputy in relation to unaccompanied minors as an especially vulnerable group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500083#WRQ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":417,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500083#WRQ02200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures","counter":416,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500083#WRQ02100"},{"type":"question","counter":417,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[28860\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500083#WRQ02200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his views on reports showing that Irish employees of American multinationals based here can receive a monetary reward for reporting fraud offences within their workplace; his further views on the fact that 51 Irish citizens have provided information under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977 between 2011 and 2015; his views on the fact that financial incentives based on this scheme have been paid to 21 Irish citizens; if he will replicate this US anti-corruption innovation in keeping with some of his other strategic decisions; and if his officials have produced any reports, analysis or projections pertaining to such a scheme.","asker":"1259","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":418,"content":"<p>I am aware that the legal framework in some countries, notably the United States, provides monetary rewards in certain circumstances for whistle-blowers.

In the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, we have provided a range of robust protections against any penalisation, financial or otherwise, suffered as a result of having disclosed wrongdoing observed in the workplace.

Personal Assistant hours are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the service is at all times responsive to client's needs and that the hours available are allocated appropriately and in a timely manner.

In accordance with the Act, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependents.

The patient flow analysis, detailed in the report of Dr. Herity's independent clinical review, provides evidence that the cath lab in UHW is currently providing services to the population of the South East and, in particular, to residents of counties Wexford, Waterford and South Tipperary.  I am confident that implementation of Dr. Herity's report will provide improved, and safer cardiology services for the South East and will strengthen links between clinicians in UHW and Cork University Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have accepted Dr. Herity's recommendation that a second cardiac cath lab at UHW is not justified.  I have also accepted his recommendation for investment in UHW to enhance the existing cardiology service there.  This investment will be reflected in the HSE National Service Plan for 2017.  During this period of investment and enhancement of services, the situation will be closely monitored.  A further independent review will be carried out in early 2017 to assess the impact that these improvements have had on the volume of patients attending the cath lab.<\/p>  <p>  Before we can implement Dr. Herity recommendation that some emergency services be provided elsewhere, it will first be necessary to ensure that a number of operational processes are embedded.  I want to be certain that any change to how a service is delivered will result in improved services for the patients using that service.  Therefore, I have asked my Department to address the implications of ceasing primary PCI services at UHW by undertaking a national review of all primary PCI services with the aim to ensure that as many patients as possible have access on a 24\/7 basis to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack.  I expect the review to be completed by the end of July 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Beyond Dr. Herity's report, I am delighted to see UHW's plans to develop the hospital as a centre for orthopaedic excellence.  I am fully committed to supporting UHW's plans in relation to this and for the centralisation of orthopaedic services for the people of the South East.  The Deputy can be assured of the Government's commitment to the development of services at UHW as evidenced by the recent approval of two new academic posts for UHW, namely Professor of Orthopaedics and Professor of Oncology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500086#WRT01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"First-Aid Training","counter":493,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500086#WRT01700"},{"type":"question","counter":494,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[28882\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500086#WRT01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his position in relation to first responders and the potential for a significant drop in national numbers if the issue of the loading on insurance for the volunteers is not addressed (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":495,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for drawing this issue to my attention.

The Action Plan for Jobs  process aims to strengthen the enterprise base, support entrepreneurship and start-ups, regain Ireland&rsquo;s lost competitiveness and ensure the potential of the regions for development and job creation through Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; Regional is fully realised, supported by competitive regional funds.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs process is working.  Over 176,800 more people are at work since the first plan was launched at the start of 2012 and unemployment has fallen to 8.3% in August 2016.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2016 commits to 50,000 additional jobs this year.  Good progress is being made with 36,000 additional at work in the first six months of the year and the rate of unemployment is now down to 7.9% for September.<\/p>  <p>  One of the strategic objectives of Enterprise 2025 is to create a business environment &ndash; including the tax environment &ndash; in Ireland where it is easy to start up and grow a business.  In relation to taxation policy my key focus is on stimulating increased investment in the productive sector and to ensure Ireland continues to develop its attractiveness as a location of choice for FDI.  We want to support the retention and attraction of talent and skills.  We also want to support greater levels of innovation to deliver sustainable growth.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs complements the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work which set outs actions to be taken in support of those that are currently unemployed in order to help them access the labour market and new job opportunities. In addition, we know that there is demand for a range of skills and experienced professionals across the economy.  There are opportunities for overseas talent to be attracted to Ireland, including attracting back our emigrants, as set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government. <\/p>  <p>  We also know we need to be competitive for attracting international talent &ndash; including in the area of personal tax.  Recent analysis by the Irish Tax Institute shows that at lower income levels (&euro;18,000), Ireland has the lowest effective personal tax rate of ten countries examined.  However, as income levels rise, taxpayers in Ireland move quickly up the international tables.  For example, at salary levels of &euro;55,000, the effective tax rate in Ireland is about 30% compared with 28.4% in the UK, while at salary levels of &euro;75,000 the effective rate of tax paid in Ireland is 35.3% compared with 28.4% in the UK.  The OECD has noted that as highly skilled mobile workers can add significant value to an economy that there may be merit, in certain cases, in introducing tax concessions targeted at mobile high-skilled worker.  Many countries have implemented favourable tax schemes focused on attracting skilled workers, for example in Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.  The DJEI submission to the Department of Finance on Tax and Entrepreneurship Review in 2015 identified the need to assess the potential for a dedicated system to allow Irish based businesses to hire key skills from abroad on an internationally competitive basis on the basis that such a system would only be appropriate where there is a key skills shortage and very limited risk of displacement.<\/p>  <p>  My Pre-Budget Submission is prepared based on the commitments on tax measures in the Programme for a Partnership Government agreed in May as well as detailed consultations with the enterprise development agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland and with Science Foundation Ireland.  My Department has also consulted with external stakeholder groups and with bodies such as the Retail Consultative Forum and the Advisory Group on Small Business.  We have also undertaken comparisons of key developments in other countries with which we compete for trade, investment and talent and have taken account of the views of bodies such as the OECD and IMF, so as to ensure we have evidence based analysis of our tax competitiveness. <\/p>  <p>  I submitted my proposals to the Minister for Finance at the end of June.  All proposals are being considered by the Department of Finance in terms of costs and benefits and in the context of the range of proposals received.  The Minister for Finance will decide on the balance of measures to be included in the Budget, in the context of the tight fiscal position of the country and the competing demands on scare resources. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500091#WRY01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Programme for Government Implementation","counter":636,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500091#WRY01750"},{"type":"question","counter":637,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[28895\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500091#WRY01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the menu of policy options she is considering to attain the programme for Government target of at least 70,000 emigrants returning during this term; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":638,"content":"<p>The goal of this Government is to support the creation of an additional 200,000 jobs by 2020 with 135,000 outside Dublin.

In the period since his retirement, Mr. de R&oacute;iste has continued to assert that the reasons for his retirement from the service were never made clear to him.   <\/p>  <p>  Following on from a full debate on 10 March 2010, Seanad &Eacute;ireann adopted a resolution which included a provision that the Government would ask the Judge Advocate General to select a nominee to carry out a review of the documentation on Mr. de R&oacute;iste&rsquo;s file to determine whether, on the basis of the documentation available to the Defence Forces at the time of the decision to compulsorily retire him, that decision was a reasonable one. <\/p>  <p>  Following advice from the Attorney General, the then Minister for Defence twice wrote to Mr. de R&oacute;iste, via his solicitors, indicating that he proposed to establish the review on the basis of the Seanad motion and enclosing a copy of the proposed Terms of Reference.  His solicitors replied indicating that they were concerned by what they termed the restricted nature of the draft Terms of Reference.   <\/p>  <p>  In 2015 following a review of the file, the Department sought further advice from the Attorney General.  Based on the advice of the Attorney General, the Terms of Reference of the original review were revised.  The then Minister for Defence, Mr. Simon Coveney, T.D., contacted Mr. de Roiste&rsquo;s solicitors in this regard, who have not accepted the revised Terms of Reference. <\/p>  <p>  The Private Secretary of Minister Paul Kehoe, T.D., wrote to Mr. de R&oacute;iste on 22 July 2016, requesting that he reply, through his Solicitors, within 21 days with a view to reaching agreement on this matter.  In the absence of agreement on the proposed Terms of Reference, it is not practical to advance the matter any further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100500092#WRZ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"}]
