Why else was the term \"within 12 months\" used?<\/p><p>Under Standing Order 56, I am perfectly entitled to table an amendment to the Order of Business.

I am sure many colleagues will have read reports of individuals being left waiting for eight days in an accident and emergency department before a psychiatric bed was provided.  This follows the much-needed closure of St. Ita's Hospital when we were promised 36 acute beds and other facilities in Beaumont Hospital.  None of us can stand over circumstances in which psychiatric patients with grave mental health issues are waiting for eight days in accident and emergency units.  <\/p><p>Psychiatrists in the Dublin area raised this issue with the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in a letter sent some weeks ago.  I raised the issue several months ago when I referred to the Cur&aacute;m centre in Swords, the largest catchment area in the Dublin region.  The Minister of State has not responded to the letter and neither she nor the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, has commented.  While we have had useful debates on this issue in the House, I find that the Minister of State almost sets out to placate Senators by stating she is doing her level best.  On her most recent visit to the House, I put it to her that she is failing in her job.  There is no question that she is failing her responsibility to psychiatric patients, particularly in the Dublin region.  We need an urgent debate to find out what she proposes to do.  Has she set aside A Vision for Change?<\/p> <p>Does A Vision for Change mean anything at all anymore?  If they were present, the patients who are obliged to wait eight days in the accident and emergency department at Beaumont Hospital before they are allocated psychiatric beds would inform the Leader that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is failing them absolutely.  The Minister of State must come before the House and answer questions rather than, as has been the case on previous occasions, trying to pl&aacute;m&aacute;s Senators and inform them as to her commitment.  I am sure she is committed but results are what matters.

There are two really positive aspects to his visit, the first of which relates to the issue of reconciliation between both North and South and the two islands.  Events such as the state dinner at which the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, will be present are a sign of progress and positive developments.  As the President indicated, the visit will provide an opportunity to acknowledge and recognise the huge contribution members of the Irish diaspora have made to England and, more generally, Britain.  I welcome that fact.

I pay particular tribute to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, with regard to the role she has played in this matter.  The Queen has strong Irish roots, being a direct descendant of both Brian Boru and the rebel Earl of Tyrone, Hugh O'Neill.  Her mother always personally presented shamrock to the members of the Irish Guards on St. Patrick's Day.  Queen Elizabeth II has been the motivating engine behind the current rapprochement since it began during the term of office of former President Mary Robinson.  We ought to honour and pay tribute to her, particularly in view of the fact that she lost members of her family to the appalling violence which occurred on this island in the past.  For her to invite Martin McGuinness to the state dinner at Windsor Castle shows a remarkable openness on her part.  She is a great woman and we should pay tribute to her.<\/p><p>In the context of the commission of investigation, Mr. Justice Nial Fennelly is a most distinguished judge but he will be hampered by the terms of reference that have been announced.  I am of the view that those terms of reference should be broadened.<\/p> <p>That is not just my opinion but also that of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  The terms of reference should be broadened to take into account the Cooke review on GSOC bugging and the Guerin review on the whistleblower allegations.

I do not use computers and do not know the exact terms.  We are extremely lucky to have voluntary groups like Digital Rights Ireland which took a case in the High Court to protect citizens.  Every message sent between citizens, including confidential messages, were recorded and held for two years.  It is utterly shocking.  A group of concerned citizens took an action in the High Court and asked, due to the ramifications, for the matter to be transferred to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.  In an historic announcement, the European Court of Justice has published its judgment and found that the EU directive in this regard is completely wrong and must be reversed.  The press release states: &quot;[T]he fact that data are retained and subsequently used without the subscriber or registered user being informed is likely to generate in the persons concerned a feeling that their private lives are the subject of constant surveillance.&quot;  I agree.<\/p><p>This is happening all over the world.

I met representatives from Women's Aid to discuss the announcement and assure the organisation of my full support.  Over the last number of years, funding for the service has been reduced dramatically.  It is an issue I have raised over the course of the past year as the closure has been contemplated.  In speaking with representatives of the service, I am certain the proposed closure is a last resort.

It might be useful for us to debate whether the terms of reference should be broadened and whether we might make that recommendation.

In 2012, 14,792 people reported to the Women's Aid national freefone helpline that they had experienced domestic violence.  Senators dealing with these circumstances will know that one of the major difficulties affected women face is the inability to find somewhere else to live.  They may have no viable housing alternative.  A major difficulty is that many of the women are actually co-owners of the family home.  Although the family home may be in significant negative equity, it restricts the woman from being designated as in housing need and restricts access to rent supplement payment very severely.  This basically means the women are utterly trapped and have nowhere to go.  Could we broaden the debate slightly to include the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, in that the lack of payments made by her Department prevents many women from escaping very severe domestic violence?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800007#G00300","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1396965300,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I wish to express my satisfaction with the events occurring in England today.  The state visit is a very happy occasion.  It is great that we have arrived at this point.<\/p><p>Farmers face challenges in respect of existing farm tax reliefs.  Many of the reliefs are very generous but circumstances can arise where farmers face prohibitive tax bills on the death of a cohabiting sibling, simply because the farm is in the name of that sibling.  In some cases, the surviving sibling farmer could be subject to an inheritance tax threshold as low as &euro;30,150, above which he or she would  be exposed to a severe tax bill.  I would like the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to clarify whether this can be the case.  It does not arise in all circumstances.  It depends on the means of the surviving sibling.<\/p> <p>There is a concern that some people could face a prohibitive tax bill.  I ask the Leader to raise the matter with the Minister, to establish whether this can be the case, whether it can be addressed in the context of this year's pre-budget Estimates and, if necessary, that he would come into the House to deal with the matter.  <\/p><p>In the recent media blitz by the Minister for Health surrounding the proposed health insurance scheme he said that the current average cost of health insurance is &euro;920.  He also said that there is no evidence that costs will be higher under universal health insurance.  Let us consider the position in the Dutch system, which the Government wants to emulate in large measure, a family with a combined income of under &euro;50,000 a year paid almost &euro;11,500 in health costs in 2012.  Therefore, the Minister's reassurances are not very reassuring.  It seems that - at this point in any case - the Minister has not got a clue about the cost and that everything that we have heard is pure speculation.  It also seems to me that a Minister who cannot even stick within his own health budget - he called a &euro;200 million HSE budget overrun a great achievement - will not enjoy the confidence of people when he reassures us that the costs are not going to skyrocket.  I worry that there will be accountants, actuaries, lawyers, technical consultants involved.  I also wonder whether we will have another Irish Water scenario with a gravy train of public money flowing into the pockets of wealthy professionals.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800007#G00400","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396965600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Bathe them in water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800008#H00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1396965600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I would like to know whether the Minister thinks that there is any point in consultation in the absence of the facts and figures.

Everybody who looks at the matter impartially will agree that the terms of reference are very wide ranging.  I would like Mr. Justice Fennelly to reach his conclusions at the earliest possible date and well within the 12 months that has been mentioned.  What is really worrying about the events in Cork and the death of Sophie Toscan du Plantier - a case which has been lost sight of in recent days - is that there is a murderer on the loose who killed that innocent woman in west Cork back in 1996.  I call on the Garda to re-open the case and redouble their efforts to ensure that whoever was responsible for the murder of that innocent woman at Christmas 1996 is brought to justice, as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800008#H00500","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1396965600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  I wish to say to the Leader that it is time to assess the affect that cuts and austerity have had on the economy.  It appears that ECB President Draghi has seen the light and is of the view that austerity is not working.  We can really see the affect that austerity has had on rural economies and rural Ireland, in particular.  In that context, Teagasc has just published a wonderful report called The Economic Structure of Towns in Ireland and it would be wise for us to debate the report in this House.<\/p> <p>This report should be used to inform policy-making when we look at rural Ireland because I see a huge difference between how Galway city and how rural towns are working and faring.  Rural towns are dying on their feet but, thankfully, Galway city is thriving.  We should try to ensure that everybody gets a fair crack of the whip.  <\/p><p>The second aspect to the debate on the economy I would like to see is the impact of tax policies which prohibit entrepreneurship and job creation.  Our high levels of VAT must be questioned.  It is not right that there are different levels of VAT in the UK, or in Northern Ireland because it is part of the island of Ireland.  On a historic day like today, it would be nice if our levels of VAT were the same so that we were not driving people to one part of the island over another.  Employers' PRSI must always be questioned as it is a tax on employment.<\/p><p>A business in Oranmore pointed out to me that shops on our streets pay rent and rates and it is impossible for them to compete with online shops.  People ask if someone can match the online price of a garment and if so, they will buy it.  We need to have some incentive - it should be a VAT incentive as was done for the hospitality industry - to ensure our shops stay open because they bring life to our towns and our streets.  To be fair, that entrepreneur is paying rent and rates, which are used to keep local authorities going.  It would be useful to have a comprehensive debate on the economy with those two aspects in mind.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800008#H00600","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396965900,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I take the opportunity on this historic day to join with colleagues in wishing President Higgins and Mrs. Sabina Higgins well on their trip to the UK and share in the optimism generated by this trip.

I am reminded, in particular, of the late Sam McAughtry who died approximately ten days ago.  I am not sure if we will have an opportunity to pay tribute to him but he was a Member of this House.  I was here when he joined us in 1996 and spoke so strongly.  He described himself as a hybrid Unionist and stated that \"I am happy to live in the United Kingdom but I am happier still to be Irish and to proclaim my Irishness\".  In the time he spent in this House, he showed his energy and enthusiasm.<\/p><p>He died at 91 years of age.  I kept in touch with him for some time after he left the House.  He left school at 14 years of age and he represented that Northern Protestant voice that we do not hear too often.

It was his energy that created the peace train about which are perhaps inclined to forget.<\/p> <p>The organisation that he established helped to maintain the railway line from Dublin to Belfast, which was often damaged by IRA activities.

I discovered this week that Ireland has the highest rate of inheritance tax in Europe.  It is almost the highest rate in the world.  Our inheritance tax rate is six times that of Italy and double that of Germany.  I mention this not to show great sympathy for people who die with a lot of money and whose children have to pay inheritance tax, but because I am concerned that it inhibits investment.  When the rate was reduced approximately 15 years ago, it created more investment.  There had been an unfair imbalance in investment in industry between Britain and Ireland, but the Government reduced our rate over some years and thereby created a large number of investments.  Our rate is six times that of Italy, twice that of Germany and above the European average.  I read in a newspaper recently that Ireland has the highest death taxes in the world.  On that basis, we should have a debate at some point on taxes in general.  I refer not only to the taxes mentioned by Senator Healy Eames but also to inheritance tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800009#J00300","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396966200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.

It seems he decided to come without his officials.  I like to see a man working alone and able to handle these matters on his own.  The Bill I am bringing forward today deals with an important issue and its proposals have the potential to save lives.  How many lives is difficult to quantify, as I will explain presently.<\/p><p>Carbon monoxide gas is produced by the burning of fuel in fires and boilers, which many of us have in our homes.  It is a highly poisonous gas and the danger it poses is exacerbated by the fact that we can neither see nor smell it.  We have no way of knowing when it is present.  When inhaled, the carbon monoxide combines with the blood in such a way as to prevent the body from absorbing oxygen and, from that point on, can have a devastating effect on our body's functioning.  People with mild symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning usually make a full recovery.  However, anybody who suffers serious carbon monoxide poisoning short of death can be left with long-term health problems. Given that its symptoms, such as headaches, nausea and vertigo, can often be attributed to other causes, poisoning by carbon monoxide is probably one of the most under-diagnosed illnesses, which means the problem is more widespread than we can readily identify.  We are not sure precisely how many deaths take place in Ireland each year, with figures ranging from a handful to as many as 40.<\/p><p>Death and sickness caused by carbon monoxide poisoning can be avoided if people install carbon monoxide alarms in their homes.  There is a great deal of confusion in this regard, with many people under the mistaken impression that smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms are the same.  The Bill requires certain homes to have a carbon monoxide alarm installed in each room that contains an open fire, stove,or boiler; inside each bedroom or within 5 m of the bedroom door; and in each bedroom in which a flue passes within or over.  Introducing a requirement for new homes that are built from this point forward makes perfect sense and is easy to achieve.  More challenging, however, is the task of ensuring that existing homes are retrofitted with carbon monoxide alarms.  Rather than introduce a blanket requirement on all existing homes to be fitted with such alarms, the Bill proposes that the requirement on existing homes to install an alarm will be triggered only by certain events, such as where a home is put on the market for sale or rent or where a new or a replacement open fire, stove, or boiler is installed.  I am proposing that these requirements come into effect on 1 January 2015.<\/p><p>The Bill envisages that the obligation to install carbon monoxide alarms will also come into play where an existing open fire, stove, or boiler in a home is repaired or serviced.  However, I have made it clear that this obligation will not come into force in January 2015 but will instead be delayed until the economic climate improves.  The case for such a delay is quite compelling.  A survey conducted last year found that while almost three out of four people are aware of the importance of having their boiler or stove serviced regularly, for almost six out of ten people the cost of such a service is a prohibiting factor.  If there are issues of affordability around boiler servicing, we must avoid introducing a measure which might make people even more reluctant to have their appliance serviced.  After all, servicing an appliance is one of the best ways to ensure carbon monoxide does not leak from it.  What I envisage is that the commencement of this particular provision would take place when people are better off and can afford both to service their appliance and install the required number of carbon monoxide alarms.<\/p><p>In all cases, home owners will be required to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the legislation by producing a certificate.  The certificate can be provided by an engineer, architect, registered gas installer or registered electrical contractor.<\/p> <p> I am not one of those who believes that legislation is the answer to every problem in society.  Wherever possible, alternatives to legislation should be considered before statutory obligations are imposed on people.  As regards this matter, however, the alternatives to legislation have been tried and they have failed to provide a solution.  Year after year, deaths from carbon monoxide are reported in the media and families of victims appeal for people to wise up to the dangers of carbon monoxide.  Those calls are invariably echoed by coroners who call on society to install carbon monoxide alarms.  While many have acted on these pleas, many have chosen to ignore them.  In the face of recurring, needless and avoidable deaths, it is now time for us as legislators to provide a reasonable and workable solution which obliges people to take steps to protect themselves.<\/p><p>The provisions of this Bill will apply to new buildings, although the word used in the legislation is &quot;dwellings&quot;.  It also applies if someone is going sell or let their home - in other words, if it changes hands.<\/p><p>I commend this legislation to the House.  I hope the Minister will support it and help to have it enacted without delay.  The measure is a worthy and worthwhile one.<\/p><p>I welcome to the Visitors' Gallery, Ms Honor Heffernan, the well-known jazz singer.  Ten years ago, her mother and sister were both killed by carbon monoxide poisoning.  It is a reminder of the seriousness of this matter.  There have been many other cases and I will get a chance to mention them later.  I urge the Minister to accept this Bill and ensure it becomes law.  I believe it will save lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800013#P00600","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396967700,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and Ms Honor Heffernan to the Visitors Gallery.

We have already debated his proposals on the use of defibrillators and he also supported the ban on smoking in cars where children are present.  In another debate on safety with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, we deduced from the numbers involved that 40% of people were escaping having penalty points attached to their licences by not bringing their driving licences to court.  We are all in favour of public safety and this Bill represents a step forward, so I hope the Minister will consider it.<\/p><p>The Bill proposes having a carbon monoxide alarm in every room that contains an open fire, stove or boiler.  In addition, a carbon monoxide alarm would have to be fitted in each bedroom within five metres of the door, as well as having an alarm in bedrooms with flues.<\/p><p>The provisions of the Bill would kick in under five conditions: when a home is newly built; when it is placed on the market for sale; when it is rented afresh; when a replacement open fire, stove or boiler is installed; or when an existing open fire, stove or boiler in a home is repaired or serviced.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn did not put a costing on such measures but, for example, fitting alco-locks in buses would not even cost 1% of the price of a bus, yet it provides a safety dimension.

Parliament is serving the citizenry by making their lives safer and protecting them from the kind of accidents we have seen happening.  Carbon monoxide is an odourless and invisible gas, so anything we can do as legislators to intervene and support this Bill will help citizens.  Considering the numbers, it would represent quite a low cost per life saved.<\/p> <p>That is something we would commend to the House and something we are all agreed upon to make Ireland a safer place.

Notwithstanding the merits of the Bill and acknowledging that the provisions represent additional safeguards in any house in which heat-producing appliances are installed, I propose to bring forward several amendments on Committee Stage which, I believe, are necessary to improve the practical implementation of the provisions to achieve a more effective and balanced outcome.  The building regulations set out the legally enforceable minimum requirements that a building must achieve and these requirements are set out in 12 parts, classified as parts A to M, respectively.  Each part of the building regulations is accompanied by a technical guidance document, TGD, which sets out how the requirements of that part can be achieved in practice.<\/p><p>Part J of the building regulations 1997 and the associated technical guidance document J, 1997 edition, set out the current legal requirements for the use and installation of heat-producing appliances in buildings and for the disposal of the products of combustion in a manner that protects the health and safety of the occupants and reduces to a reasonable level the risk of buildings catching fire in consequence of their use.<\/p><p>In recent years my Department has signalled its commitment to considering whether and in what circumstances mandatory provision for carbon monoxide detectors might be appropriately included in part J and TGD J.  Against this background and having regard to the latest developments in the standards since the current 1997 regulations were introduced, a broadly representative working group was established under my direction in mid-2011 to undertake a comprehensive review of part J and TGD J.  Over the course of the review, data provided by the Health Service Executive indicated that over the 11 year period from 2000 to 2010, inclusive, 73 fatalities arose due to accidental poisoning following exposure to carbon monoxide.  This represents an average of over six carbon monoxide deaths per annum in Ireland that could potentially have been preventable, that is, assuming no carbon monoxide detector was installed and that the presence of a functioning carbon monoxide detector could have provided an alarm which would have resulted in appropriate action being taken to prevent exposure to the toxic effects of carbon monoxide.<\/p><p>Furthermore, from the evidence of carbon monoxide incidents in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, the indications are that the majority of such incidents appear to occur with solid fuel appliances, while gas and oil are deemed to be the safest.  Open flue or flueless appliances, because they take the combustion air from a room, have a potentially greater risk than a balanced flue scenario.  An analysis of all the available information led the review group to the conclusion that the use of carbon monoxide detectors to the proper standard and with adequate in-built visual and audible warning systems would give added protection to homeowners.  During the review the Department, in conjunction with other relevant public bodies, was satisfied that previous concerns over sensor reliability and the lack of any end-of-life indicators in carbon monoxide detectors had been addressed by developments within the industry.<\/p><p>The new part J and TGD J documents will come into force on 1 September 2014 and will require carbon monoxide detectors to be provided in all new dwellings and in existing dwellings where new or replacement open flue or flueless combustion appliances are to be installed.  As the Senator can see, we are moving a little ahead.  Carbon monoxide detectors will also be required where a system chimney attached to any heat-producing appliance passes within or over a habitable room.  In such cases carbon monoxide detectors should be in or near bedrooms and where open-flue or flueless appliances, including fireplaces, are used as well.<\/p><p>Accordingly, the provisions which relate to the installation of carbon monoxide detectors in new and existing dwellings where new or replacement open-flue or flueless combustion appliances are to be installed are already in place.  In the interests of coherent regulation I imagine the Senator has no wish for me to duplicate this provision on the Statute Book.<\/p> <p> It should also be noted that Part L, conservation of fuel and energy, of my Department's building regulations of 1997 requires all new and replacement boilers in dwellings to have an efficiency of 86% since 31 March 2008 and 90% since 1 December 2011.  This requirement promotes the installation of room sealed boilers which have a lower risk of the escape of carbon monoxide due to balanced flues.<\/p><p>While in no way seeking to detract from the commendable tenets of the Bill, I have a number of concerns about some of its provisions and believe it will be necessary to introduce amendments on Committee Stage to deal with some practical implementation issues.  For example, the use of the term &quot;Building Control&quot; in the Short Title may cause confusion with the Building Control Acts, whose primary purpose is to provide for the making of building regulations and building control regulations applicable to the construction of new buildings, material alterations and changes of use.  The application and scope of the proposed Bill relates to dwellings only and is in the sole context of carbon monoxide.  Accordingly, the Bill would benefit from a change in Title to more accurately reflect the subject matter therein.<\/p><p>Section 5(2) requires compliance with the provisions of the Bill to be demonstrated by certification.  Although no details are provided on what would constitute an inspection for this purpose, I do not consider that the list of persons who may provide certification on foot of an inspection is entirely appropriate to this task.  In addition, it could lead to unnecessary additional costs for home owners and landlords.<\/p><p>The requirements in sections 6 to 10, inclusive, to secure certification should a dwelling be newly constructed, offered for sale or lease or undergo a boiler replacement or service appear, on the surface, to be onerous and may need further consideration and refinement given the potential costs to householders.  I also caution that the requirement for a householder to secure certification when repairing or servicing an existing heat producing appliance may have the unintended consequence of householders postponing servicing of an appliance because of the additional cost of certification.  While I note the commencement of this section may be deferred until economic conditions improve, it needs further consideration.<\/p><p>Section 11 provides that enforcement be carried out by local authorities.  Again, I have concerns about the resource implications, both human and financial, of this provision.  In any case, I do not believe local authorities are best placed to enforce the Bill's provisions.  Given that approximately 1.5 million dwellings could potentially require certification, an annual inspection rate of 20% would potentially require 300,000 certificates to be produced to local authorities.  This amounts to more than 7,000 certificates per building control officer.  This provision is not workable in practice and householders may not react positively to visits from local authority personnel in such circumstances.  For this reason, the provision should be amended.<\/p><p>The offence provisions outlined in section 13 appear disproportionate and excessive for application to a householder in the context of the Bill.  A Class E fine may be more appropriate, with graduated fines applying to the owners of multiple properties.<\/p><p>The requirements in section 15 have already been met in technical guidance document J, Heat Producing Appliances 2014, which provides guidance on the location of carbon monoxide detectors. <\/p><p>It is worth noting that my Department, with the support of the National Consumer Agency and National Standards Authority of Ireland, has proposed to the European Commission the development of a harmonised European standard in respect of carbon monoxide detectors under the umbrella of the construction products regulation.  This measure will facilitate third party oversight by a notified body during the manufacturing process.  The Commission supported Ireland's proposal and early this year mandated the Comit&eacute; Europ&eacute;en de Normalisation or European Committee for Standardization to commence work on the matter.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn should be commended on introducing the Bill.  While I welcome and support many of the provisions contained therein, the import of some of the proposals would inevitably be to impose costs on individual householders.  We need to be cognisant of this and work towards achieving a reasonable balance, without compromising the safety we all seek, when we table amendments on Committee Stage.  Although the cost of a single carbon monoxide detector complying with the relevant standard and having an end of life indicator would be between &euro;30 and &euro;40, this cost would rise in line with the number of appliances or rooms in a dwelling.  Moreover, the costs of inspection and certification could be in the region of between &euro;150 and &euro;200.  It should be noted that these are not once-off costs because replacement costs would arise every five to six years.<\/p><p>While the new Part J regulations, which will become operable from 1 September 2014, will give added protection to new dwelling owners and the owners of existing dwellings when heat producing appliances are being replaced, it is nevertheless important that we get the message across to householders that they should take a number of key actions to prevent carbon monoxide arising in the first instance.  It is important that they engage only competent persons to ensure the proper installation and commissioning of appliances, flues and chimneys; proper air supply is maintained to combustion devices; and combustion appliances are properly maintained and inspected on a regular basis.  While the new Part J of the technical guidance document and the provisions of Senator's Quinn's Bill will provide enhanced consumer protection in respect of carbon monoxide in dwellings, the primary focus must remain on ensuring these three requirements are realised in the first instance.<\/p> <p> The relevant authorities with responsibility in this area will be obliged to ensure that information to raise awareness of the potential dangers of carbon monoxide in homes will continue to be provided on a regular basis.  Against this background, a number of bodies - the Commission for Energy Regulation, the Registered Gas Installers of Ireland, RGII, Bord G&aacute;is, the National Standards Authority of Ireland and the Irish Liquid Petroleum Gas Association - all contribute in different ways to raising public awareness of the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning.  I take this opportunity to compliment them on the work they do.<\/p><p>I again thank Senator Quinn for bringing forward the Bill.  As already indicated, I am not opposed to its passing Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800015#R00800","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396969200,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom tr&eacute;asl&uacute; leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Feargal Quinn as an mBille t&aacute;bhachtach seo a chur chun tosaigh inniu.

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh sin.<\/p><p>This Bill represents an important step in the context of protecting citizens in their homes.  As previous speakers indicated, carbon monoxide is a highly dangerous, colourless and odourless gas.  Most Irish households have at least one heating appliance which, when in good working order and properly maintained, allows carbon monoxide to be safely vented via a chimney or whatever.  When such appliances are defective, carbon monoxide can enter a room without there being any indication that it is present.  It is for this reason that it is dubbed &quot;the silent killer&quot;.  As Senator Quinn said, carbon monoxide is responsible for causing the deaths of approximately 40 people each year.  The Bill is designed to ensure such deaths will be avoided by means of the affordable solution of having carbon monoxide alarms installed in people's homes.  We are all aware of high profile cases relating to this matter.  In Derry, for example, two teenagers unfortunately died because a heating appliance had not been properly fitted.  The family of a man from Listowel who died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning last February have appealed to people to have the proper alarms fitted in their homes.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il is delighted to support Senator Quinn's Bill, particularly as it is a very practical and common-sense measure.  I welcome that the Senator has included a provision whereby the owners of existing dwellings can be afforded an additional period in which to have their homes retrofitted with alarms.  I also welcome that the Minister has stated he will not oppose Second Stage.  Given that he has accepted the thrust of the legislation, I call on him to ensure Committee and Remaining Stages are taken at the earliest opportunity in order that the Bill might be sent to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for consideration and approval as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>This legislation has the potential to save lives.  If it related to road traffic accidents, we would not even be discussing it.  The reason for this is that if the matter were that simple to deal with, the requisite legislation would already be in place.  The Bill is quite straightforward.  Senator Quinn carried out an enormous amount of research in order that he might bring it before us.  While the Minister has signalled his agreement to the Bill passing Second Stage, I hope he and his Department will work speedily to ensure the remaining Stages will be disposed of at the earliest opportunity in order that the legislation might be enacted as quickly as possible.  This would allow us to meet the 1 January 2015 deadline relating to new builds envisaged by the Bill's author, Senator Quinn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800017#T00200","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1396969200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and thank him for accepting the Bill.  I compliment Senator Quinn on bringing forward this very important legislation.  I do not know why those opposite are so amazed that the Minister has accepted the Bill.  He has obviously taken this measure, which is positive for society, on its merits.<\/p> <p>He is noted for putting an emphasis on competencies and consumer protection and I was not surprised when I heard that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, was accepting his Bill.  Carbon monoxide is very dangerous and known as \"the silent killer\".  The statistics exist to prove that.  The Minister mentioned an average of six deaths per year.  I note that was up to mid-2011.  I do not know if the average number of deaths is decreasing.  The HSE's health protection statistics for 2011 said it was one or two.  Even one or two is one or two too many.  I thank the Minister for bringing this measure forward.<\/p><p>The purpose of the Bill has been well outlined.  Many speakers have referred to installation, monitoring, qualifications of the installers and where monitors are to be sited.  The Minister referred to where a flue passes within or over a bedroom.  One does not want too many monitors upstairs.  One wants a maximum of two if it is within the 5 m radius.  It is something to look at.  The Bill provides that the statutory requirement to install a carbon monoxide detector would only be triggered by certain events, of which there are six.  One of the events is the servicing of a boiler.  Most people get their boilers serviced annually.  The onus will be on every household when the boiler is serviced to ensure that Part 10 of the Bill is complied with.  Many people already have carbon monoxide monitors.  One of the first things my son did was install one notwithstanding that it was not mandatory.  The Minister mentioned certification and the figure of 300,000.  I did not realise it was that many.  He mentioned 1.5 million houses.  Certification is the thing.  As the Minister said, we need competencies and to ensure that the people who install the monitors are qualified.  One person has been left out of the Bill.  Engineers, architects and registered gas installers are referred to but there is no mention of oil installers.  Currently, oil installers install oil boilers and are not qualified to install gas boilers.  The Minister will have to look at that as I am not an expert.<\/p><p>When one sells a house, one must obtain a BER certificate.  If the competencies and qualifications of BER certifiers were linked with the competencies and qualifications of boiler certifiers, it would halve the cost of certification.  Provision could also be made to ensure that the person who installs the boiler is also qualified to certify the boiler.  It should come within the cost of installation rather than to have a separate cost for certification.  While it is important that certification is carried out, it is also important to keep costs down.  I note that section 10 makes provision for people who cannot afford it and for delay.  People must service a boiler or it becomes dangerous.  One does not want to stop them servicing boilers on foot of excessive cost.<\/p><p>There is an onus on landlords to ensure that this is done.  Every landlord must be alerted to his or her duties when the Bill becomes law.  There is also a duty on local authorities.  I was always a great one for saying that when an extra duty is placed on a local authority, an extra &euro;1 must come with it.  Deputy Hogan is the right Minister to tell that to.  As local authorities are landlords, I presume they are in the same bracket as private landlords and that monitors will be installed in local authority housing immediately following the enactment of the legislation.<\/p><p>I want to refer to technical specifications.  The legislation is silent on the level of carbon monoxide that will trigger the monitor.  Each monitor in each EU country has a different level.  The Minister said something about the levels.  Will there be EU harmonisation of levels?  It would be a good thing.  If a monitor is effective in one country, it should be deemed to be effective across the EU.  If it is not certified with a certain level, it may be the wrong one.<\/p> <p>However, there are many pollutants in our homes.  In the meantime before everybody has installed a carbon monoxide monitor, we should ensure people put plants in their homes that absorb carbon monoxide from the air.  The plants that do this are well known but NASA has conducted research that found plants are efficient at absorbing carbon monoxide and other air pollutants and they have been launched into space as part of the biological life support system orbiting the earth.  Spider and fern plants take dioxins and so on out of the air while the aloe plant has been proven by NASA to work in the context of carbon monoxide.  Nine aloe plants absorb the equivalent of one carbon monoxide monitor.  The NASA research should be used in this regard because the penalties are onerous when they kick in.  Board members of public buildings should be alerted to the fact that the responsibility falls on their heads.<\/p><p>I compliment Senator Quinn on introducing the Bill and I am pleased the Minister will accept it.  This demonstrates how we in the Seanad can work positively together for the good of society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800017#T00300","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396969800,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I commend Senator Quinn for again introducing important, practical legislation which can add value and save lives.  It is one of a number of Bills he has succeeded in getting through the House and he deserves credit for doing so.  It is refreshing and welcome that the Government will accept the legislation because we have been critical in the past of the lack of support for Bills tabled by Opposition Members, including Senator Quinn's upward-only rents Bill.  If a Bill is brought forward in good faith and it will improve circumstances, it can be amended on Committee Stage if the Government feels there are problems with it.  The Minister indicated he may well have to table amendments but that is also welcome because it will improve the legislation and perfect it.  This is a good exercise in democracy and another good day for the Seanad as the Government accepts a Bill from one of its Members.<\/p><p>It is important that we address the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning.  If we can put in place legislation that compels developers, home owners and so on to install carbon monoxide alarms and only one life is saved, it will be worth it.  Last month, a gas fitter in Derry was sentenced to prison for negligence in a tragic case in which, unfortunately, two men died from carbon monoxide poisoning in 2010.   These cases are rare but they happen and, therefore, we have a responsibility to do what we can as legislators to make sure we can prevent as best we can such tragic deaths.  Like Senator Quinn, I welcome Honor Heffernan to the Visitors Gallery.<\/p><p>Deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning in the home are, thankfully, rare in this State, averaging one or two each year, but people who are poisoned and survive experience long-term impacts on their health.  While it is tragic when people die, it is also tragic when people end up with illnesses as a result of such poisoning.  Smoke alarms are statutorily required in all buildings, including homes, and everybody accepts that they have saved lives not only in Ireland but in all states.  They make perfect sense and many people are alive today in this State and others because of them.  Unfortunately, we do not always make sure that they work.  Very often batteries are not replaced and that has caused problems.  Such alarms need to be serviced and maintained to make sure they are working.<\/p> <p>There have been many instances in which smoke alarms have saved lives.  Carbon monoxide alarms, if present, would also save lives.  Legislation needs to be introduced to require the installation of carbon monoxide alarms when building, selling or leasing a dwelling.  The alarms are available to buy in the State and cost in the region of &euro;30.  The price, therefore, is by no means excessive.  The alarms are very affordable.  Thirty euro for a carbon monoxide alarm is very small money in the context of all the costs associated with buying and moving into a home.  Installation should be made mandatory.<\/p><p>It could be and has been argued that recent energy efficiency schemes should make mandatory the installation of carbon monoxide alarms.  This would provide a modest economic boost in addition to addressing the health and safety concerns that have been articulated by Senator Quinn.  Carbon monoxide alarms are made in this State, are easy to install and do not require a connection to an electricity circuit.  Therefore, there is no real impediment; it is just a matter of our passing this legislation and making installation mandatory.  It should happen as a matter of course, as with fire alarms.  There should be a carbon monoxide alarm in every home.  There are no significant practical or technical issues that could be cited as an excuse for not making carbon monoxide alarms mandatory, as proposed in the legislation.  If the alarms were in place, they would save lives.<\/p><p>In Baltimore County in the United States, legislation was passed in 2010 that required all rental properties to have carbon monoxide alarms installed.  At the time, there was a series of deaths in that county from carbon monoxide poisoning.  Since the legislation was passed, there have been no deaths from it.  This is proof that what is proposed works.  Other regions in the United States , including New York, Alaska, Colorado and California, have passed similar legislation, and there have been similar reductions in carbon monoxide-related deaths and illnesses.<\/p><p>There is not much more to be said.  This is very straightforward.  I commend Senator Quinn on introducing the legislation, being very practical and doing something that will be very worthwhile for all of us in this State.  I thank the Minister for his generosity in accepting the legislation.  I hope it will eventually be passed and that we will not see it shelved for months or a year.  I hope we can make progress on it as quickly as possible.  I believe it has the support of all Members in both Houses, and I will certainly be supporting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800019#V00200","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396970100,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to House.

This was the case in Scotland in 2013.<\/p><p>Another issue I have with the Bill, as set out, relates to the rental sector.  Some 20% of all Irish families live in private rented accommodation.  Senator Quinn referred to a home that is subject to a new lease or the renewal of an existing lease.  A very significant number of tenancies in the State are not governed by lease at all but by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  This should be taken into account in the drafting of the Bill.<\/p><p>Minimum standards for the private rental sector are covered by minimum standards regulations from 2008 and 2009.<\/p> <p>Adding the supply of carbon monoxide alarms to those regulations is the way to proceed because they stipulate minimum requirements such as the provision of smoke alarms.  For example, two smoke alarms must be provided in a rented property, and a multi-occupancy house, such as a traditional Victorian property divided into a number of units, must have a fixed alarm system that is linked to the electrical system.  I ask the Minister to consider including the minimum standards for the private rented sector properties in this legislation and Senator Quinn could include a provision to amend leases to take into account the new regulatory environment.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane mentioned that there is a legal obligation under existing legislation to provide smoke alarms in domestic homes but that not the case.  It is the case with a new construction but it is not the case with existing constructions.  I suggest to both Senator Quinn and the Minister that we must incorporate legislation that covers fire safety because a very significant number of people live in properties that are not covered by fire safety regulations.  Perhaps the Minister will consider, if it is possible, amending the certification process to include carbon monoxide and smoke alarms.<\/p><p>I am concerned about some of the proposals in the legislation.  The Senator proposed to have a certificate made available when a boiler appliance, stove or whatever is serviced.  However, there is no legal obligation on a home owner to service a boiler but, ironically, such exists under the minimum standards for rented properties legislation.  As things stand there is no legal obligation in the case of a domestic property where the person is a home owner to provide same.  We need to consider imposing a requirement on people where no legal obligation exists.  There is no legal obligation to sweep one's chimney or service a gas or oil fuelled boiler and so forth.  We must consider including such a provision in the context of grounding legislation.<\/p><p>I am interested in introducing a certification system for rented properties, like the national car test, where the person renting the property must show it is fit for purpose.  I have studied such certification very closely for a number of years.  I do not think the Senator's legislative proposal is workable.  For starters, the numbers of people he listed who are capable of providing a certificate effectively means it costs &euro;130 to certify that a &euro;30 appliance is in place.  That provision needs to be reconsidered.<\/p><p>I wish to discuss the proposal to ask local authorities to police the scheme.  I can assure the Senator that the enforcement by local authorities of the private rented minimum standards legislation has been incredibly varied and in some local authority areas it has been downright appalling.  In terms of enforcement, the Senator needs to look beyond local authorities.  I think the home owner, landlord or whoever should be obliged to provide certification and the inspection system needs to be carefully thought out.<\/p><p>With regard to public awareness, people know that carbon monoxide poses a danger.  Surveys have shown that three quarters of people know there is a significant danger posed by carbon monoxide.  However, a very significant number of people say they cannot afford to service their appliance.  We need to be very conscious when seeking to impose legal obligations on people that there are supports.  I suggest we provide supports for people who have very low incomes, particularly when it comes to servicing appliances that are and can be life threatening.  This may be a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.  There are people who cannot afford to service their boilers or have their chimney swept which is a core factor we need to consider.<\/p><p>With regard to the Bill before us and all those caveats, it is important for us to deal with the issue of carbon monoxide, in the first instance, and fire safety because one cannot be separated from the other.<\/p> <p>We need to find a way in which we can attach a fire safety obligation not only on new builds but in situations where existing dwellings are old and are probably more in need of fire safety precautions than some of our more modern constructions.  Will the Minister support an amendment extending the minimum standards regulations for rented properties, which, as I said, is 20% of the entire housing market, to include carbon monoxide detectors?  As I suggested to Senator Quinn, maybe we could look again at the definition of leases and rented property under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800020#W00200","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396970700,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and compliment my colleague, Senator Quinn, on his initiative in bringing forward this Bill.  I also refer to the presence in the Visitors Gallery of a very old friend of mine and a very distinguished artist, the singer, Honor Heffernan, whom I heard on radio the other day describe with great dignity and sadness the tragedy that occurred in her family when her mother and sister were killed as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn has addressed a very important point if a life can be saved.  My Jewish friends say that he who saves one life has saved an entire universe.  Bringing attention to this problematic situation could certainly save lives, although perhaps not an enormous number of lives, but every life is very important.  I understand reference was made to a situation in Northern Ireland which was very tragic.  I also recall a situation in, I think, Cork where two young men, two friends, off on a jaunt from school died as a result of a faulty appliance.  I would like to think hotels would be included in this legislation if they are not already.<\/p><p>This shows the value of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I remember saying during the debate on it that what we would have to do would be to kill the Government with kindness.  As there are so many Bills on the Order Paper, we should move them and send them to the D&aacute;il because no legislation is coming to this House from the D&aacute;il.  I have introduced a small amount of legislation but Senator Quinn has become an absolute mill for legislation and it is quite wonderful.  He has addressed very important subjects.  I am sure he would approve of me saying that, like myself with Miriam, he has had great assistance from his personal assistant, Anne, and has been lucky enough to use another person, who is in the Visitors Gallery, his solicitor, Dr. Brian Hunt, who has helped him in the preparation of this Bill, although the initiative has come from Senator Quinn and we must give him compliments for this.<\/p><p>I very much appreciate the fact the Government, through the Minister, has indicated that it will allow the Bill to go to Committee Stage.  However, the Government has yet to address a previous Bill on medical insurance, which was also very important.  It was introduced from the Government benches by Senator Colm Burke.  There were small elements of it which were not quite right and the Government could easily have amended it and let it go through.  I do not know why it did not at that Stage.  I hope Senator Burke will reintroduce this Bill.  However, on this occasion, Senator Quinn's Bill, which the Government feels has certain technical defects, will be appropriately amended by the Government on Committee Stage.  That gives me hope it will go through to the end.<\/p><p>Returning to the substance of the Bill, what we are dealing with here is something quite insidious which is actually worse than gas because, since the beginning of the provision of urban gas, gas companies have taken care to add distinctive odours to gas, precisely to alert people to the existence of a gas leak.  We all know what the smell of gas is like and that we have to telephone a certain number which is posted on the gas appliances, whether central heating boilers or gas cookers, in our homes.<\/p> <p>The problem with carbon monoxide is that it is a particularly insidious gas because it has no detectable odour.  For this reason, it is very difficult to detect.  It can creep around the house without making any great inroads onto the consciousness of the people.  I agree with Senator Hayden that we need to include rented premises in this provision as well.<\/p><p>The Minister indicated that the question of expense also needs to be considered in this context.  I am not sure what the possible cost of this might be.  Perhaps Senator Quinn can give us that information in his riposte or response.  I should not say &quot;riposte&quot; because I do not think he is capable of a riposte.  He is far too gentlemanly for that.  The Senator might have given us these details already, although I do not think so.  I have smoke detectors in my house.  They are actually very cheap.  The batteries need to be replaced every so often.  I assume the cost of carbon monoxide alarms is quite similar, so it is not prohibitive for them to be installed after the event.  One will not need to dig up the whole heating system or take out the gas cooker.  I presume they can be planted or stuck onto the ceiling.  I am sure they are commercially available.  Perhaps Senator Quinn will be kind enough to let the House know about this.<\/p><p>The legislation before the House sets out a wide range of circumstances in which carbon monoxide monitors will be necessary.  For example, it will not be possible for a house to be sold without a certification of this kind.  The provision regarding newly-built homes is the easiest of the lot because it simply means that the installation of a monitor will become part of the builder's check list.  The Bill also provides that there should a carbon monoxide alarm in each room which contains an open fire, stove or boiler.  That will apply to just one room in most modern houses.  I am a little unlucky in the sense that I have open fires in every room in my house.  I like them.  I was surprised to hear on the same programme on which Ms Heffernan spoke that people have had their health seriously affected by the burning of a candle.  That is quite extraordinary.  It shows the sensitivity of the human animal to this particularly noxious gas.<\/p><p>Once again, I welcome in the presence in the Gallery of our friends.  I would like to make a particular reference to the dignity and grace displayed by Ms Heffernan, who has been instrumental in highlighting this issue.  I compliment my colleague, Senator Quinn, for pursuing this important matter.  I understand his proposal has been seconded by Senator Barrett.  I hope the Government will allow this Bill to go through speedily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800022#Y00200","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396971000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I appreciate the fact that the Minister has grabbed hold of this issue and agreed to accept this Bill.

The figure of 73 fatalities mentioned by the Minister suggests that the investment needed in this respect would be worth &euro;73 million on the basis that one life is worth &euro;1 million.  I know it is very hard to place a value on a life.  I emphasise the need to get this done as speedily as possible.<\/p><p>As Senator Norris mentioned, I have introduced many Bills over the years.  A number of them have been put on the long finger.<\/p> <p>I was told more research was needed in respect of the organ donation Bill; the food provenance Bill; the employment permits (amendment) Bill, which has been delayed for quite some time; and the public health (availability of defibrillators) Bill.

The Construction Contracts Bill became law but it took a lot longer than I expected.  <\/p><p>Senator Cullinane mentioned a number of other jurisdictions that have introduced legislation such as this.  Scotland recently introduced legislation and 24 states in the US have introduced similar legislation.  In recent years, there have been a succession of needless and avoidable deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning.  Earlier this year, Kevin Lucey died from carbon monoxide poisoning.  Miriam Reidy died from carbon monoxide poisoning in January 2011.  Trevor Wallwork, his daughter Kimberley and son Harry were found dead in the sitting room of their home in County Sligo in December 2011.   Two young men in Northern Ireland also died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning and a family was very fortunately saved in another incident in county Cork a few months ago.  <\/p><p>I appreciate all those involved in this Bill.  In particular, I appreciate what the Minister has done in saying that he wishes to accept this Bill and improve it.  A friend of mine called Jack Kavanagh brought the issue of carbon monoxide to my attention.  Dr. Brian Hunt wrote the Bill for me.  We negotiated over a number of aspects.  Ann Crotty from the National Standards Authority of Ireland and Patrick Fleming, chief fire officer of Dublin Fire Brigade, read the Bill and gave me excellent advice which I appreciate.  I believe this is an example of how this Seanad can work.<\/p><p>This legislation will save lives but the one thing I ask the Minister to do is to make sure we do not delay.  I know he does not intend that to happen and I know it is not easy to get things to move as quickly as we would like but with his enthusiasm and commitment and the effort he puts into almost everything he does, I am sure he is going to make it work.  I look forward to seeing the Bill back in the House at a very early date for Committee Stage and I look forward to the improvements that have been mentioned by various Senators and it becoming law later this year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800023#Z00600","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1396971300,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1396971300,"counter":112,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800024#AA00250","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1396971300,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800024#AA00275","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1396971300,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 15 April 2014.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of Seanad","time":1396971300,"counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800024#AA00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1396971300,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That No. 2 be taken at 5 p.m.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800024#AA00500","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1396971300,"counter":117,"content":"<p>  Question put and agreed to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800024#AA00600","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1396971300,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.40 p.m. and resumed at 5 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Fines (Payment and Recovery) Bill 2013: Report and Final Stages","time":1396971600,"counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800025#FF00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1396971600,"counter":120,"content":"<p>We will now deal with the Report Stage of the Fines (Payment and Recovery) Bill 2013.

Before I respond to the amendments, I wish to apologise on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, who is unable to attend today.<br \/>I thank Senator Quinn for raising this issue and for the very constructive way in which he has approached the matter.  His amendments focus on his main concern, as I understand it, which is the possible seizure and disposal of real property on foot of a recovery order.  Before I address these specific points, it is worth recalling the purpose of the Bill.  Its primary aim, as Senators will be aware, is to provide alternatives to the imprisonment of people for non-payment of fines.  It does this by requiring the court to take a person's financial circumstances into account when fixing the fine, by allowing the person to pay the fine by instalments over 12 months and by providing a number of alternatives to imprisonment where a person defaults.<br \/>It is also worth recalling the history of the recovery provisions, as these are not new.  Section 16 of the Fines Act of 2010 provides that a court shall, in all cases in which it imposes a fine, make a recovery order.  The recovery order provided for in the 2010 Act is exactly the same as the recovery order in this Bill.  Part 3 of the 2010 Act, which contains section 16, is being repealed and those provisions will not appear in this Bill.  It was never the intention to change these provisions except to the extent required by the introduction of attachment of earnings orders, which was a commitment given in the programme for Government.  It is also worth saying that the only impact of the changes being made in this Bill in so far as the recovery provisions in the 2010 Act are concerned is to make it less likely that recovery orders will actually be made.  They will now only be made where the court decides against making an attachment order, where a fine is more than &euro;500 or where the court decides in a particular case that it would be more appropriate to make a recovery order rather than a community service order.  <br \/>Turning now to amendments Nos. 1 and 4, the result of which, were they accepted, would be to remove the possibility of real property, that is, land and buildings, being seized and disposed of by a receiver where a person fails to pay a fine.  It is to be noted that recovery orders come at the end of a process that starts with the conviction of a person for an offence and the fixing of a fine.  Subsection (1) of section 5 of the Bill, which largely replicates section 14 of the Fines Act of 2010, sets out the purpose of the section as follows:<blockquote>The purpose of this section is to ensure, in so far as is practicable, that, where a court imposes a fine on a person, the effect of the fine on that person or his or her dependants is not significantly abated or made more severe by reason of his or her financial circumstances.<\/blockquote>Subsection (2) states:<blockquote>Where a person of full age is convicted of an offence, the court shall, in determining the amount of the fine (if any) to impose in respect of the offence, take into account the person&rsquo;s financial circumstances.<\/blockquote>If the case is heard in the District Court, the maximum fine is &euro;5,000.  Senators may be interested to note that since section 14 of the Fines Act 2010 was commenced in January of 2011, fines imposed have been generally small and far less than the value of almost any house.<\/p> <p>For the three years since 2011, more than 99.9% of fines imposed were less than &euro;5,000.  In the first nine months of last year, only 41 fines out of a total of 63,000 were greater than &euro;5,000 and the only one more than &euro;20,000, which was the highest fine, was for &euro;27,500.  In 2012, of the 95,000 fines only 58 were more than &euro;5,000; 12 were more than &euro;10,000; and none was more than &euro;20,000.  Of course, a person who feels the fine is too harsh can appeal it.<\/p><p>I do not doubt that the information before me is correct.  The reality is that these fines are for much smaller amounts than in cases where obtaining the amount through the disposal of a property would be considered.  From the information the Department has been able to glean in the time available, large fines of &euro;10,000 or more are almost exclusively imposed on companies and on the State.  A sample revealed no default other than in one case where the company had ceased to trade.  Larger fines in respect of which the possibility of the seizure of real property might arise are not the ones being defaulted on.<\/p><p>The amendment to the provisions on recovery orders made in the Fines Act 2010 means that recovery can only apply to a small minority of fines.  The 2010 Act provides for recovery orders to be made every time a fine is imposed.  Under the Bill, recovery orders will only fall to be considered where the fine exceeds &euro;500 and where the court has decided it would not be appropriate to make an attachment order.  The court will then have a choice between making a recovery order and a community service order.  As just 10% of fines are for more than &euro;500, recovery orders will only even be considered in a small minority of cases - possibly no more than 3%.<\/p><p>I hope this will assure Senators that fines are not imposed at a level that would in the normal course give rise to the seizure or disposal of property.  However, that is not an argument for excluding that possibility in the appropriate case.  The recovery provisions are most likely to apply to the self-employed and to companies.  If land were removed from the recovery provisions as proposed in the amendments, in extreme cases of serious white-collar crime, including environmental, health and safety offences, we would be making the law dramatically more liberal than it currently is.  At the moment, if a large fine is imposed on an individual for environmental damage and the person fails to pay the fine, he or she can be imprisoned for a period at the discretion of the court.  Whereas the maximum period of imprisonment for default for a summary offence is 90 days, there is no such limit for an indictable offence.<\/p><p>Under the provisions of the Bill that person's assets, including land, could be seized and disposed of to meet the fine in question.  However, if land was excluded as Senator Quinn proposes in the amendments and land comprises the only asset that could satisfy the fine, the only option open to the courts would be community service.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 4 could inadvertently result in perpetrators of serious offences, in respect of which and having taken into account their financial circumstances the court had imposed a very large fine, serving between 40 and 240 hours of community service rather than having to pay the fine or face a jail term, as is the case today.  Albeit this arises only in a very small number of cases, would that be fair?  If a person in employment was in a similar situation, his or her earnings could be attached and the fine collected, whereas this person could avoid paying the fine even though he or she has the assets to do so.<\/p><p>The Bill is not intended to make life easier for the asset-rich criminal, including those convicted of white-collar crime or others who refuse to pay fines.  While it is intended to keep people out of prisons, it must not encourage wealthy individuals on whom, and institutions on which, large fines are imposed to start defaulting on them.  We can all agree that would be a perverse outcome.<\/p><p>Orders under the Bill will be made by the Judiciary.  We trust judges to exercise their powers with constitutional fairness and proportionality.  There is nothing to suggest that they will deal with this law any differently than they have thus far in other provisions where they have been required to exercise their judicial discretion on these matters.<\/p><p>Section 5 ensures that fines take account of a person's financial circumstances.  Fines in general are far smaller than would justify the seizure and sale of a person's house or property.  There may be cases where the disposal of real property may be justified and it would be wrong, when we are establishing primary law in this area, to exclude that possibility.  Judges apply the law fairly and proportionately.  We should trust them to do so regarding the provisions of the Bill, as we do in countless other cases that come before the course.<\/p><p>I appreciate the Senator's remarks and his constructive approach.  It is appropriate to air the issue.  His raising the matter has afforded me the opportunity to put on the record of the House the rationale for not accepting the amendment.  That is ultimately important in terms of proceedings that might come before the courts because, in trying to understand what the Oireachtas had in mind when a Bill was passed, the courts can read the transcripts of the proceedings in this House and the other House.

I understand my colleague, Senator D'Arcy, raised the issue again.  The debate on the amendments allows us to tease out the issue and to work through the best outcome.  I propose to take amendments Nos. 2 and 3 together.<\/p><p>Section 8(3) provides that the recovery order shall authorise the receiver, alone or accompanied by such and as many members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as he or she considers necessary, and paragraph (a) of the said subsection allows the &quot;use of reasonable force&quot;, where the receiver enters a premises at which he or she has reasonable grounds for believing property belonging to the fined person is located.  Senator Quinn's amendment No. 2 would mean that the receiver could not enter a premises, even where the occupant did not resist his or her entry, unless accompanied by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am reliably informed that Garda resources are not such that they can be deployed where they are not required.  Instead, the Bill provides that where the receiver anticipates or encounters hostility or difficulty, he or she can avail of the support of the Garda.  Therefore, it is not an automatic requirement where a receiver comes on a land or a property that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is present.  Where they believe there could be some hostilities and that they could be met by a difficult situation, they can request a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be present.  That is the explicit difference.  Where the receiver does not require such assistance, there is no need for the presence of the Garda.  It would tie up the Garda were that to be done. <\/p><p>It is important to remember that receivers are Revenue sheriffs appointed by the Government and who act on behalf of the Government in their capacity as they enter such lands.  Many believe they are reasonable people who carry out important work on behalf of the State.  The Minister has every confidence in their capacity to exercise their powers in accordance with the law, with or without the presence of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as the case may be.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 3, also in the name of Deputy Quinn, excludes the use of reasonable force to gain entry to a premises.  Where one's preference is for the use of no force and for the quiet surrender of the property at issue - this will not always be the case as we know from our history - without recourse to reasonable force, as it were, the order of the court could be frustrated and the recovery provisions would quickly become unworkable.  If the court makes an order authorising the seizure and disposal of property, it is difficult to see how such an order can be given effect if the use of reasonable force is excluded.  One would hope that fined defaulters would co-operate with the receiver and surrender property to him or her without the need for the use of force.  Where this does not happen, however, the receiver and, as appropriate, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be able to use reasonable force.  The term &quot;reasonable force&quot; is, I understand, widely used in the Statute Book and, in this case, would be the minimum amount of force required to gain access and to seize property as ordered by the court.  It is difficult to see how these provisions could operate without the possibility of the use of reasonable force.  For that reason I am unable to accept the amendment.<\/p><p>It is the firm intention of the Government, law officers and orders of the court that for orders of the court to be upheld, people should comply.  It is worth pointing out that this all follows from a decision of the courts.  In that small number of cases where reasonable force has had to be used, unfortunately it has had to be used.  We would all like a situation where no force would be used but to remove it, as is the intention of the amendment, would make the order of the court inoperable and, as such, unfortunately, we must retain it for that small number of cases where, for whatever reason, people are unable or unwilling to accept a decision of the court that has been granted.  I stress that these are all decisions of the court that have been taken.  There has to be some means where, in a tiny minority of cases, people refuse to accept the legitimacy or veracity of the court decision, this would apply.  For that reason we cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800027#HH00300","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1396972800,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I understand what the Minister of State has said.

It was not the intention that the court's rule could be frustrated on that basis and we should co-operate with it.

However, the question that arises is whether this provision does that.  In other words, does the deduction of a fine from an employee's earnings over 12 months put employment at risk by raising the costs of the employer and making the business unviable and would the possibility of having to attach an enforcement order put an employer off employing people?<\/p><p>It must be remembered that employers are routinely required to collect moneys on behalf of the State.  Under family law, attachment orders, which are a common feature in circumstances where separation has occurred, have been a feature of the law for almost 40 years.  Most recently, as referred to by Senator Barrett, employers were required to commence deduction of the local property tax from employees' wages.  There is nothing novel about this proposition.  However, I accept Senator Quinn's point that it is an additional requirement.  Much depends on the size of the business and the number of people in administration working through these issues.  <\/p><p>As regards whether this provision would put employment at risk or dissuade an employer from taking on staff, having considered the matter carefully the Minister is satisfied that this measure has no consequences for business or employment.  Senator Quinn's amendment bears this out.  The average fine set out by the courts is approximately &euro;300.  Half of all fines are of less than &euro;200.  If Senator Quinn's amendment were accepted, on average, employers would be able to deduct &euro;15 from the fine to compensate them for administering the attachment process.  The Minister does not accept that &euro;15 is material in this case.  Furthermore, given that for the majority of employers attachment orders will be a rarity, it is unlikely that the possibility of making an order such as this would have any influence on their decision to employ people.<\/p><p>While the Senator's amendment would make little material difference to employers it would be a significant departure in the basic law.  It would create an expectation that where the State requires deductions to be made and paid over to it, either by employers or others, they should be compensated for doing this.  That is not something that could be embarked upon lightly.  It is for this reason, and the fact that the amendment would in the view of the Minister be of no material benefit to employers, that I am unable to accept it.  However, I understand the argument made by Senator Quinn.<\/p><p>This largely boils down to the size of the business with which one is dealing.  Larger businesses with larger numbers of staff involved in their central administration who have set up these systems could probably deal adequately with it.  The issue may be more difficult for smaller businesses.  However, the problem that arises is that in imposing this, the knock-on effect for other areas within our basic law could be a difficulty.  This issue requires to be teased out more widely than in the context of this Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800028#JJ00300","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1396973400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800028#JJ00400","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1396973400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, Senator Barrett, only Senator Quinn can speak a second time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800028#JJ00500","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1396973400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Unfortunately from our perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800028#JJ00600","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1396973400,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I believe that we have established in this nation an anti-business attitude.

Section 23 deals with data sharing and exchange of information between the Courts Service and Revenue.  This has to happen in a circumstance where attachments to earnings are made.  The section also deals with social protection as a body and such other body as may be prescribed.  If another body is prescribed the regulation must be laid before both Houses and can be annulled by either House within 21 days.  The point being made by Senator Quinn is whether legal change should be required in the first instance.  The Senator knows that this is a standard feature of Bills of this type.  Where there is a substantive change, the sponsoring Minister is required to lay information before the Oireachtas Library.<\/p> <p>Then it effectively becomes law unless there is no resolution quashing it within a 21-day period by either or both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Senator Quinn is concerned that the provision allowing for another body to be prescribed is at large.  It is in place so that if in future it is deemed that some other body has information which could be used in the collection of fines, then the Bill will not have to be amended to cover that possibility.<\/p><p>The point Senator Quinn makes is that it should be amended to cover the possibility and that if we are to include another body then we should come back to the Houses for the purposes of amending the Bill.  The parliamentary oversight provided by the requirement to lay any regulation made under the Bill before both Houses along with the power of either House to annul such a regulation is sufficient protection and is proportionate to the issue at hand.  The alternative, which would require the Act to be amended to add another body should the need arise in future, would be disproportionate and unwieldy.  In these circumstances the Minister will not be accepting the amendment.<\/p><p>Were another body to be included, the amendment would require the Minister to lay that provision before the library of the House.  Then both Houses would have the opportunity of a 21-day window to annul the order.  I know from my time in opposition and in government that these matters come up on the Order Paper on a daily basis.  I presume the Minister of the day would issue a statement to the effect that he or she was including the other body or bodies for whatever reason.  It is on this basis that the House would have an opportunity to debate the matter if the House so determined.  It is standard in most similar legislation that this particular parliamentary oversight would be in place.  For this reason the Minister's view is that the provision is standard and difficulties that may emerge in future in terms of an additional body or bodies being added for the purposes of data exchange should be dealt with in this way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800028#JJ01100","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396974000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I understand the position.

However, we only place it on some people and not others.  Section 14 relates to attachment provisions.  Essentially, it applies if a person is employed under a contract of employment - this is what Senator Quinn was concerned about - or is in receipt of an occupational pension.  We did not really discuss whether this was a burden on pension funds.  Is there a case to suggest that the Department of Social Protection has successfully lobbied against performing this task, which we have now imposed upon those who employ people?  Was that considered in any way?  The Department seems to be exempt under section 14.

All local authorities have websites featuring information on the services they provide.  No comprehensive review has been undertaken of the need for local authorities to clearly identify which members of staff are responsible for the various areas of responsibility, for example, housing, roads, development and planning.  While websites may feature the names of heads of department, they do not provide information on sub-departments.<\/p><p>The European Commission website provides information on all sections of the various directorates general and the names of all those with responsibility.  Providing such information on local authority websites would overcome the problem people face when they try to obtain information on which individual they need to contact about specific issues.  We must move with the times, especially given that the Minister has introduced major reform of local government.  The abolition of town councils will result in a significant reduction in the number of councillors in many areas.  Members of the public need access to information more than ever.  I ask that the Department examine this issue and set out a clear agenda for progressing the matter in the coming 12 months.  We must not miss the opportunity provided by the current reform of local government to inform members of the public, especially about those who are in charge of various areas.  I ask the Minister to address this issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800030#LL00800","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1396974600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Colm Burke for raising this matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline the position regarding customer services in local authorities.<br \/>We need a local government service that represents its citizens and communities efficiently and effectively and provides access to the services people need in the most efficient and user friendly manner.  Local authorities have an ongoing commitment to applying the highest standards in dealings with their customers in the delivery of their services.  They continue to provide this quality service notwithstanding the reduction of more than 25% in their staffing complement in recent years.  Given the changes in staffing levels and the variety of working patterns in a modern organisation, for instance, job sharing, it may not always be feasible to provide a specific contact name for all services.  None the less, where this is the case, local authorities should make additional efforts to ensure the relevant unit can by contacted by making available a direct line number, specific e-mail address or link from the website to address queries.<br \/>That said, local government has been using best practice in service provision, embracing the benefits of the effective use of modern technologies, social networking, web based collaboration, mobile apps and geographic information systems, GIS, in an interactive manner with the public.  Such an approach can already be seen through the roll out of the <i>FixYourStreet<\/i>website, which is structured around an interactive map, allowing anyone to identify the precise location of a range of non-emergency local problems they wish to report and receive a prompt response to explain what can be done to address the issue raised.  Low cost, web based solutions such as <i>FixYourStreet<\/i>enable local authorities to remain at the forefront of service delivery and help deliver an important element of our e-Government strategy.<br \/>The Senator refers specifically to making available contact details for housing authorities.  The broad range of housing services provided by local authorities impacts on the daily lives of a great many people.  Housing authorities act in many capacities, including as landlords for some 130,000 families and individuals; as the first contact point for those in need of social housing supports and for housing needs assessment; as administrators of housing grants, with some 8,000 older people and people with a disability directly benefiting each year; as providers of emergency accommodation for those who are homeless or in danger of becoming homeless; and as providers of loan finance for those who wish to purchase their own home.  It is important, therefore, that those availing of these varied services, including those with special housing needs, can access help and information quickly and easily.<br \/>To their credit, housing authorities deliver these services to a consistently high standard, notwithstanding the constraints that apply in terms of resources, both financial and operational.  The availability of easy to use access, such as in the case of the examples I cited, can help overcome these constraints.  Local authorities should use contact arrangements that best suit the needs of their customers.  The elected members of each local authority can and should play an important oversight role in ensuring their respective executive puts in place appropriate arrangements of this kind.<br \/>I am conscious of Senator Burke's comments on the type of service one should expect from local authorities.  I assure him that the overall intent of the reforms of the local government system I introduced recently is to put the customer first.  I will do everything possible, through oversight, to ensure this objective is realised in the years ahead. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800030#LL00900","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1396974600,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's response and his ongoing reforms.

I wish to raise the case of an individual with locked-in syndrome who would like to be moved from hospital so as to be cared for in the family home.  This is a particularly sad case on which I have been working for the past year.  The man in question has been an inpatient in hospital for over a year and his family is very worried about his mental state and quality of life if he remains in hospital for much longer.  He is a young man in his 30s who, although ventilator dependent, remains very aware of what is happening around him.<\/p><p>I have been liaising with the family and HSE representatives on many levels on this case for some time.  Understandably, the family wants to see the man brought home to be cared for.  They have the doctors' support in the hospital as there is nothing more that can be done for the man there.<\/p><p>I have raised the matter on behalf of the man and his family in many formats, including parliamentary questions, e-mails and letters, and I am now doing so by way of Adjournment debate.  I have been informed the reason the individual will not be moved from hospital to the family home is the high level of funding required to deal with his complex care needs.  I understand there are many complex care needs involved but I do not believe a person should have to remain in hospital for the foreseeable future owing to the lack of approval for funding for a home care package.  The spending of additional days, months and years in hospital due to a lack of funding is unacceptable.  The man deserves and wants the opportunity to live in his own home and to be surrounded by his loved ones.<\/p><p>It is heartbreaking to see what the man's family must endure.  They travel up to Dublin every day to be with him and then travel home.  Lately, he wrote a very emotional letter pleading for people to take him home.  He described the high point of his day as his being moved after waiting for somebody to come to turn him around.  I do not believe we can imagine how difficult and heartbreaking it must be to be literally locked inside one's own body, unable to speak and move and having to wait for somebody to come to roll one over.<\/p><p>I fear for the man's physical and mental state if he is to remain in hospital for much longer.

As the Senator rightly said, I do not believe it is possible for us to imagine what it must be like.   I acknowledge the devastation experienced by the man's family and fianc&eacute;e on his diagnosis and their incredible commitment to him daily.<\/p><p>Locked-in syndrome is a challenging condition in which a patient generally retains cognitive function but requires constant medical care, treatment and supports, such as ventilation.  It must be acknowledged that, in this case, the individual's needs are particularly complex, and patients with such needs are generally cared for in an intensive care setting.  The man's post-discharge care would involve the provision of appropriate medical devices essential to survival, such as a ventilator, and 24-hour specialised intensive care unit nursing care.  Given the complexity of his care needs, if he were to be cared for at home he would need an extensive home care package, including 24-hour specialist nursing care with clinical governance by an appropriate consultant.<\/p><p>I understand several multidisciplinary meetings have already taken place at local level between the family, the HSE and Resilience Ireland - a company that specialises in specialist advanced home care management.  I have also been assured that there has been significant engagement between Beaumont Hospital and the local community care service in an effort to find a solution appropriate to this patient's needs.  While it may be possible to provide such a solution, the equipment, staffing and resources required are likely to be very substantial and would have to be accommodated within the overall resources available to the HSE for disability services.

I wish to raise the issue of access to the Safe Pass for the unemployed.  A man came to me recently who had been unemployed for a year and a half but who luckily got a job for nine months on a building site because he had his Safe Pass on the day of hiring.  He is a qualified driver of one of the highest types of crane.  The man, who has a wife and three children, wants to work.  He got his nine months' work but since then has been unemployed for several months.  He wants to go back to work but his Safe Pass has expired.  He went to the Department of Social Protection to renew it and he understood the Department would fund that.  However, this does not seem to be the case.  He was told the Department would renew the pass when he returned on having got a job but, unfortunately, nobody in the construction industry will hire anyone who does not have a Safe Pass.  The man has been toing and froing with his local welfare officers, etc., but is still in limbo.  He cannot afford to renew the pass himself and the Department seems to be unwilling to do so.<\/p><p>Recently, the man was offered a job that is to commence in the near future.  He went back to the Department of Social Protection and it wanted to know the day on which he would be starting so as to go about the task of renewal but he could not give the date.  If he specified the date, he would lose his social welfare benefits from that date with no guarantee that the job would start then.<\/p> <p>There is no guarantee about when the job will start.  If it does not start, we all know what it is like when one must reapply for social welfare.  One can wait anything from six to 12 weeks for a payment.  To me the solution is blatantly obvious.  I imagine I am speaking for many other people, but this man is positively looking for work.  He has a possibility of work but he will not get the work unless he has a Safe Pass card but he will not get the card from the Department unless he has a job.  Let us have a meeting of minds.  The solution is very simple.  Will somebody kick the bucket and renew his Safe Pass?  If that was done, this man would be off the live register and would be able to provide for his wife and children, which would be good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800031#MM01100","speaker":"1163","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396975800,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I hope I do not take too long to get to the point that is of interest to the Senator, but he knows what the replies are like.<\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection provides a wide range of activation supports for jobseekers, lone parents and people with disabilities.  One of the Department's key objectives is to support jobseekers to improve their education and skills levels in order to help them meet the requirements of the labour market.  The Department has estimated expenditure of &euro;994 million on employment supports in 2013.  Against a backdrop of significant fiscal consolidation, the Government has provided resources of over &euro;1 billion on a similar range of supports in 2014.<\/p><p>The Pathways to Work programme includes the provision of opportunities, supports and assistance to jobseekers by intensifying the Department's level of engagement, in particular, those who are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.  The Intreo service delivery model offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers and this new service model, which is more efficient in its delivery, is currently being rolled out across the country.  Activation measures include the requirement to attend group or individual meetings, and-or avail of suitable education, training or development opportunities, or specified employment programmes, which are considered appropriate to a person's circumstances and which have been agreed with him or her as part of a personal progression plan.<\/p><p>My understanding is that all workers on construction sites and in ancillary service employments are required to hold a valid Safe Pass certification.  The aim of the SOLAS Safe Pass health and safety awareness training programme is to ensure that, over time, that all workers in construction will have a basic knowledge of health and safety and be able to work on-site without being a risk to themselves or others who might be affected by their acts or omissions.  From a health and safety perspective, construction workers are bound by law to hold a valid Safe Pass card.  It is a matter for the contractor to ensure that workers are provided with access to the necessary training to achieve the certification.  The construction industry has done much commendable work in the past number of years to improve safety on construction projects which I believe has reduced the level of serious injury and deaths.<\/p><p>It is not the function of the Department to fund the provision of Safe Pass training and I consider that the responsibility resides with the employer.  The Department is conscious, however, of the barriers posed by a lack of a pass or having lapsed Safe Pass certification for a jobseeker wishing to get back to work.  To that end, the Department provides funding to the jobseeker under the technical employment support grant.  The jobseeker must have registered with the Department's employment services and undertaken a guidance process leading to an agreed personal progression plan.  The jobseeker must also be in receipt of certain specified welfare payments, such as a jobseeker's allowance, lone parent payments or payments related to disability and long-term illness benefits.  In the past three years, approximately &euro;778,000 has been provided to some 8,332 jobseekers nationally under the scheme.<\/p><p>TESG is designed to support a person to overcome identified barriers in progressing from unemployment to employment.  Training, with limited exceptions, must be on certified courses.  TESG can be used to meet the full costs of courses including Safe Pass certification.  A jobseeker can access a maximum of &euro;500 from the scheme per annum.  Any decision to grant aid a particular intervention is also subject to the eligibility requirements of the scheme and available funds.<\/p><p>Before approving a grant of this nature the Department will generally require proof that there is a clear identifiable employment opportunity.  The Department also requires further information to ensure that the application is consistent with the prior employment history of the jobseeker and that an opportunity is likely to arise should a given course of training be approved.<\/p><p>The Department's services and supports are continually monitored and kept under review by management.  Account is taken of the views of staff, public representatives and users of the service to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service.  The Department is very conscious of the need to provide efficient and effective customer facing services at a local level for clients of the Department.

That seems to be the kernel of the problem.  I would like a manager in the Department of Social Protection to say \"Okay, you will qualify to get your Safe Pass certified.\"  The man needs somebody to put it in writing that the employer will possibly have a job for him in the near future.

If even 100 of the public consultations are read, it would become abundantly clear to a Department, Minister or Government that the public do not want the proposals, which the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in particular seems to be bandying around as a sure way of dealing with our Kyoto Protocol requirements. <\/p> <p>If just 100 of those public consultations were read, it would become abundantly clear to any Department, Minister or Government that the public does not want the proposals that the Government - particularly the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources - seems to be bandying around at the moment as a sure way of dealing with our Kyoto Protocol requirements.<\/p><p>Wind energy has shown time and time again that it provides an intermittent supply of energy.  This Government's reliance and determined approach to the provision of energy from wind is questionable, particularly in light of all the international evidence.  I have copies of various papers that clearly show that the supply is intermittent.  I do not have time to go into them tonight.  The peak demand for electricity in Ireland varies across the year.  The level of demand is approximately 3,000 MW in the summer and 5,000 MW in the winter.  Some 1,880 MW of wind generation capacity is connected to the grid at present.  Its output varies according to wind conditions.  A new record for wind generation of 1,769 MW was set on 17 December 2013.  Approximately 677,000 MW hours were produced by wind energy in December of last year.  In 2012, an average of 15.5% of all power in Ireland was generated from wind sources.  Wind energy has proven itself to be very unstable and unpredictable as a source of energy.  Questions must be asked about the increasing reliance of Ireland's energy suppliers on such an unstable source.  According to the Commission for Energy Regulation, just 43 MW of wind energy was produced during the week beginning 30 September 2013.  According to the Government, a new record for wind generation of 1,769 MW was set on 17 December 2013.  That variation of 1,725 MW on our grid represents more than half of our summer energy needs.  It is clear that there are questions.  All the international experts are questioning Ireland's over-reliance on meeting its Kyoto Protocol requirements through wind energy.<\/p><p>All electricity consumers, regardless of whether they get their electricity supply from wind energy or some other source, pay a public service obligation levy.  It is as much as &euro;10 per household in some instances.  Therefore, every household in the country is paying for renewable energy sources.  Much of that money is being collected by the Government and is going to major wind farm developments in the country.  It is clear that questions have to be asked about this.  The taxpayer is bailing out multi-million euro wind energy developments.  An independent cost-benefit analysis is required at this stage.  A Department that is headed up by a Minister who is clearly in favour of wind energy cannot be allowed to initiate any form of consultation.  The consultation has to be objective and scientifically based.  It must be removed from the Department and the industry.  We need an independent assessment and cost-benefit analysis.  Anything else is simply fiddling with the figures.  It is time for such an analysis to be done.  The taxpayer who is funding this train at the moment deserves clear and concise answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800032#NN00700","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396976400,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I thank Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill for raising this issue.  Ireland is fortunate to have very rich wind resources.  We can exploit these renewable resources to generate electricity, reduce our import bills for gas and oil and contribute to decarbonising our energy systems.  The exploitation of this clean, sustainable and indigenous resource will allow us to break our dependence on expensive imported fossil fuels and reduce our harmful emissions.  It also holds the potential for Ireland to become an exporter of renewable energy.  As Senators will be aware, Ireland has a challenging EU renewable energy target to meet by 2020, which includes meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources.  The deployment of wind generation to meet our domestic targets has already started to realise economic benefits.  A recent survey of the members of the Irish Wind Energy Association indicated that some 3,400 people are employed in this sector.<\/p><p>Developers have made, or are making, decisions on their Gate 3 connection offers.  The response has been very positive.  Information from EirGrid and ESB Networks indicates that sufficient wind farms have accepted offers to connect to the grid to facilitate meeting the target of providing 40% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020.  The Gate 3 phase of group processing by EirGrid and ESB Networks has resulted in approximately 3,000 MW of wind generators accepting their offers to connect so far.  When that is added to the current installed renewable generation and existing contracts for connection, it is clear that Ireland is on track to meet its EU renewable energy targets by 2020.  There is significant work ahead in delivering the required grid infrastructure and developing smart grid solutions.  A major effort and commitment is also required of wind farm developers to bring these projects to fruition.  Nevertheless, this is a very positive milestone.<\/p><p>In addition to the figures I have mentioned, just over 2,000 MW of renewable generation is already connected to the power system in Ireland, mainly from onshore wind farms.  In the electricity sector, it has been estimated that between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of installed wind generation will be required to meet Ireland's renewable targets, in addition to hydro-generation, bio-energy and renewable combined heat and power generators.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland produces an annual report on renewable energy in Ireland.  This report examines the contribution made by renewables to Ireland's energy requirements for the period since 1990.  In the past five years, renewable energy has saved over &euro;1 billion in fossil fuel imports, has reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 12 million tonnes and has not added to consumers' bills.<\/p><p>The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is completing a cost-benefit analysis of the export opportunities offered by renewable energy.  In order to ensure Ireland continues to meet its renewable energy targets, while also ensuring wind generation does not have negative impacts on local communities, the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are undertaking a review of the wind energy guidelines.  This review will address the key issues of noise, including separation distance, and shadow flicker.  Draft guidelines went out for public consultation earlier this year.  The responses to this consultation are being studied with a view to finalising guidelines by mid-2014.  The revised guidelines will apply to all wind farm developments in Ireland.  It is important to note that any new wind farms that may be built will be subject to the Planning Acts, including the requirements for public consultation.  Renewable energy policy in Ireland is developed on the basis of objective policy analysis, taking account of the views of all relevant stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014040800033#OO00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1396976400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I accept everything that the Minister of State has said.  I appreciate that he is not responsible for this matter.  It is the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.

It is a kick in the teeth for all the people who made submissions.<\/p><p>The Minister of State mentioned that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is carrying out a cost-benefit analysis.  The Department in question is flagging up our energy policy.  It is responsible for ensuring this country meets the Kyoto Protocol requirements by 2020.

I will make two brief points in response to two key points he made.  In respect of his comment about the role of consultants in the process being a kick in the teeth, I urge him to wait for the conclusion of the public consultation and the Government's response to it before he decides whether or not the role of consultants has been a kick in the teeth.<\/p><p>In response to his point about the Department being responsible for this, is it not the case that if the Department did not play a role in this, the Senator would say that it had abdicated its responsibility for the area?  It is the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  It has a role to play in this.  What it has done is put in place a consultation process, which it has outlined to everybody and in which a huge number of people have participated.  It is reviewing that.  As I am sure the Senator is aware, a further two consultations will take place.  The Department is preparing a scoping report for the strategic environmental assessment along with a summary Department document on the stage 1 consultation.  The stage 2 consultation will then be held and will offer everybody an opportunity to make contributions.  After that, there will be a third consultation stage when a draft policy is clear.  <\/p><p>The Senator is telling me that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources should not be doing this kind of work but this Department has been tasked with making sure our country is energy-sufficient and can move towards energy independence in a way that meets the legal requirements the previous Government signed our country up to.
