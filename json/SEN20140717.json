They are here because of the issues discussed yesterday in the D&aacute;il and the motion we have tabled, No. 63, motion No. 11 regarding the cut in funding for the national advocacy service of the Irish Deaf Society.  A range of organisations are affected by the cuts in funding of &euro;1.2 million for voluntary organisations imposed by the Government.  A copy of the Proclamation hangs in the main hall of the building, reminding us of the guarantee of equal rights and opportunities for all citizens of the State.  While we are all agreed on that principle, we seem to find it very difficult to fulfil.<br \/>On the Order of Business yesterday Senator Jillian van Turnhout listed the organisations impacted on by thee cuts: the Alzheimer Society of Ireland; Arthritis Ireland; Aspire; Br&iacute;, the acquired brain injury advocacy association; the Centre for Independent Living; Chronic Pain Ireland; the Disability Federation of Ireland; the Dyslexia Association of Ireland; the Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation; GROW; the Huntington&rsquo;s Disease Association of Ireland; the Irish National Council of AD\/HD Support Groups; Irish Autism Action; the Irish Deaf Society; the Irish Heart Foundation; the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association, IMNDA; the Irish Stammering Association; the Migraine Association of Ireland; MS Ireland; Muscular Dystrophy Ireland; Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland; the Neurological Alliance of Ireland; the Post Polio Support Group; the Asthma Society of Ireland; and the Carers Association.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today Professor Orla Hardiman expresses her horror at the impending closure of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland which gives a voice to more than 700,000 people and comprises 30 aligned organisations.  A spokesperson for the Neurological Alliance of Ireland states: &quot;The Taoiseach's statement that charities can appeal the decision will be cold comfort to the charities affected as no timeline for the appeals process has been provided and they are left in limbo with no choice but to close their doors.&quot;<br \/>The members of the Irish Deaf Society who are in the Visitors Gallery have seen their advocacy service wiped out.  Who will communicate and interact with the Government on their behalf?  The gulf in understanding between the hearing and deaf communities is enormous and was put into stark and almost comical focus by the statement from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that representatives of the Irish Deaf Society should call in to discuss the cut in funding.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to have the motion we have tabled debated today.  We are seeking a reinstatement of funding not only for the Irish Deaf Society but also for all the organisations impacted on.  They all rely on this funding to keep going.  Staff in these organisations now find themselves unemployed, with no indication as to when their appeal will be heard or whether funding will be reinstated in five, six, ten or 12 months, if at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700003#B00400","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1405589400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I join Senator Mark Daly in welcoming the group from the Irish Deaf Society to the Visitors Gallery.  The issue of funding for voluntary groups, particularly health groups such as the Neurological Alliance of Ireland and the Irish Deaf Society, was raised by colleagues on both sides of the House yesterday.  In his response the Leader indicated that an appeals process was under way, overseen by Pobal, and that the deadline for applications was the end of the month.  I understand it will take six to eight weeks for appeals to be heard.  A large delegation from the Labour Party has met representatives of the Irish Deaf Society to discuss the issue.  Everybody is concerned to ensure groups which are providing an excellent service will not have their funding discontinued.  There is a bigger picture to consider in that substantial funding has been given to other groups which are also providing excellent services.  I very much hope the review process being undertaken by Pobal will be fruitful for all concerned.<\/p><p>I again ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan, to come to the House as soon as we return in September for a debate on the situation in the Middle East.  We are all horrified and appalled by the heinous killing of four boys yesterday - two ten year olds, a nine year old and an 11 year old, all from the same extended family - who were playing football on a beach in Gaza.  To hear Israeli Government spokespersons blaming Hamas for these heartbreaking deaths is very difficult to take.  I welcome the ceasefire in place for a few hours today, but it is not enough to alleviate the suffering of the people of Gaza, more than 200 of whom have been killed in the appalling onslaught by Israel.  I hope Ireland will be very active in the coming weeks in seeking to achieve a ceasefire on the Gaza Strip and a resolution of the conflict.<\/p><p>I welcome the publication of the report of the interdepartmental working group on mother and baby homes and the appointment of Judge Yvonne Murphy to chair the commission of investigation.  She has an excellent track record, having chaired the commission of investigation into sexual abuse in the archdiocese of Dublin and produced a very strong report on that inquiry.  She is an ideal choice to chair this commission.<\/p> <p>The data we have seen, such as the number of deaths of infants and children in the homes and the number of adoptions carried out, shows we need a more in-depth investigation.  <\/p><p>As it is the end of the session I wish everyone well.

This is the last Order of Business in this term.  I thank the Leader, the Deputy Leader and leaders of all of the groups for their courtesy, efficiency and thoroughness with which they conducted the business of the House.  We are very proud of this House and acknowledge the debt owed to its Leader.  I thank the Cathaoirleach, as always, and his staff for the way proceedings have been conducted.  Also, in the realm of thanks, I thank Senator Conway for the motion he tabled yesterday and the recent one on the environment.  They demonstrated that there is great spirit on the Government benches in terms of raising important issues and adding to the status of the House.<br \/>I wish to express concern about the compellability of witnesses.  The ruling, I gather, is that the accounts of the body concerned must be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That is a most important post in the Constitution and people like Arthur Griffith and Eamon de Valera saw the necessity to have a watchdog for public expenditure.<br \/>My question arises from a matter raised frequently and eloquently by Senator Colm Burke in the House - section 38 bodies.  If the Committee of Public Accounts cannot compel these people to appear - which appears to be the ruling - we must adopt as a rule of thumb that they will not receive money if they will not talk.  There must be some <i>quid pro quo <\/i>if one gets public money but decides not to talk about it afterwards before the Oireachtas.  I know the Minister for Finance and his new Minister of State, Deputy Harris, will be here later.  I suggest we adopt that stance as a working rule.  If a body seeks an exemption and is not going to answer for how it spends money then we cannot give out funding.  The House must have a Committee of Public Accounts and a Comptroller and Auditor General auditing how we spend money which is a major issue in the country.

I commend him on tabling the amendment.<\/p><p>I welcome the members of the Irish Deaf Society to the Visitors Gallery and thank the sign language expert for being here.  This highlights the difficulties faced by deaf people in this country.  Their situation has been made more difficult by the harsh decision, or recommendation, to remove funding worth &euro;100,000 from the advocacy service.  No organisation deserves funding more than the Irish Deaf Society because it is essential for it to have an advocacy service in order to communicate with Government.  The society is not in a position to communicate as directly as they would like or as we are fortunate to be able to do so.  It seems very wrong that people with all their faculties, like the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, deem it appropriate to withdraw a service from an organisation and from people who need an advocate.  That is why I am delighted to see that Senator Mark Daly has put so much effort into this matter.  He is the Irish Deaf Society's Seanad nominee on the administrative panel.  He is a good advocate for it and has shown his commitment to deaf people in this society.  That is why I think today is a very special day.

I also want him to indicate the exact position regarding the restoration of an  accident and emergency service at Roscommon County Hospital.  The service was removed by Deputy James Reilly and the Taoiseach prior to the by-election in Roscommon-South Leitrim.  In fact, I represented the constituency from 1977 to 1981 along with the late Sean Doherty and Joan Burke, who is in good form.

I had not realised that 2014 is the European year against food waste.  This is a topic I have discussed many times previously but it is interesting to see how some other countries have responded to food waste.  Approximately 300 million tonnes of food waste is thrown out in Europe because people simply are not careful when purchasing their food.  One of the developments in France relates to what is called &quot;inglorious&quot; food.  It is a very interesting development.  A huge amount of food never reaches the grocery shops because it is misshapen - it could be misshapen carrots, onions, potatoes - and the shops do not wish to sell it.  I can understand that.  The movement reduces prices by 30% and people are buying and eating the food.  It is just as good, but simply misshapen.  It is something we should consider in this country.  If we are throwing out food at a time when people are going hungry, we can do something about it.  I call on the grocery trade in particular, but also the suppliers and the farmers, to get together and help to feed people with food that would otherwise be thrown out.<\/p><p>I congratulate you, a Chathaoirligh, and your team for your work in the past year.

I would like to say hello to the people from the Irish Deaf Society who are in the Public Gallery.  I wholeheartedly support the call for the debate.  It is absolutely essential that this funding be restored.  I think I mentioned yesterday that on the one hand, we have Pobal taking an average of &euro;43,000 from these organisations while on the other, &euro;250,000 was being spent on preschool inspections not so long ago.  It shows where the priorities have gone wrong.<\/p><p>I also stand to support the amendment to the Order of Business.  On the scale of human tragedy, some of the issues today, although they may be important, are in no way close to the issue raised by Senator Reilly.  I wholeheartedly agree with her.  I sincerely ask the Leader to arrange by whatever means he has available to him a debate today or tomorrow so that we are seen as a Parliament that takes a stand on the Palestinian crisis.  <\/p><p>I also have another very serious issue to raise with the Leader.  It has been brought to my attention that a HIQA inquiry is ongoing into a nursing home in Connemara called Aras Chois Fharraige.  I have been told that two whistleblowers have been suspended because they drew attention to what they saw as misconduct within that nursing home.  They are concerned about the treatment of the patients within the nursing home.  I would have raised this issue on the Adjournment but we obviously do not have that capacity available because the House is going into recess.  It is a very serious issue that needs to be brought to the attention of the Minister for Health.  Obviously, the first issue is the welfare of the patients and the need for any allegations to be thoroughly investigated.   Perhaps the Minister can check what the scope of the ongoing investigation is.  Is he absolutely sure that the patients are being dealt with properly?  The second issue is that the whistleblower legislation came into effect this week.  People find it strange that the whistleblowers - the people who drew attention to it - are the ones who have been suspended in this case, which seems to be the wrong course of action.  It is a very serious issue and perhaps the Leader through his good offices could follow up with the Minister and revert to me on this issue so that we can make sure that the best is done for everyone involved.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700006#E00500","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1405591200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Following on from what Senator Barrett said about the Committee of Public Accounts, I think the CPP made an important decision in that for the past eight months, the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children has been denied the right to cross-examine the 2,600 organisations that get funding from the HSE and the Department of Health.  The money they are getting amounts to &euro;3.27 billion.  The Committee of Public Accounts told the Committee on Health and Children that we could not bring any of those organisations in to cross-examine them about how that money was being spent and to find out whether we were getting value for money.  I am delighted that the Committee on Health and Children can now do the job it was appointed to do, which is making sure the health budget allocated by the Department of Health to the HSE is used properly and that there is proper scrutiny of the organisations that are getting funding.  It is wrong that it took eight months for the CPP to make a decision on this matter so that the Committee on Health and Children can proceed with its job.<\/p><p>I know people are probably tired of hearing me talk about the issue of junior doctors.  Unfortunately, we have now gone to the other extreme with regard to junior doctors.  The working time directive is now being put in place and we have a problem in that we do not have enough junior doctors to fill all of the posts.  The other problem is that junior doctors who are in post are not getting proper training.  There has been no proper restructuring by the HSE.  It has got to a point where junior doctors are resigning their posts within the HSE and working for agencies.  I spoke to one junior doctor recently who told me that he is now getting &euro;52 per hour working as a senior house officer because he is employed by an agency.  That is &euro;2,000 for a 40-hour week.  It goes to show the lack of planning and structural reform that is required in respect of how we have managed this area over the past number of years.  It is something I flagged three years ago and something that I will continue to raise.  There is a major crisis in some hospitals because we cannot get the people we need and we are now dependent on agencies.  Agencies are abusing what they are employed to do.  They are designating doctors as having a qualification or experience which they do not have.  These doctors are being put into positions for which they are unsuitable.  It is time we had a major debate on long-term planning relating to our hospital services and making sure that we do not end up in the same position in three or four years time.

When he appeared before the joint committee yesterday, he said he wants in the future to use his office as an educational tool, not only as a place where complaints were received.  This is a good example of how his office takes on board the experiences, stories and pain of those who come to share what has happened to them and, in his own words, say to him: \"We do not want this to happen to other people; we want you to sort it out.\"  I commend him for his work.

We have all received numerous representations from a wide range of groups which have had their funding cut in the last while.  We all agree that this funding should not have been cut and that it seems a little mean-spirit, given the amount of money being saved compared to the value being achieved.  Instead of tabling show-boating motions, Senator John Kelly and I went to see the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, who was not unaware of the concern expressed and the hardship caused.  He said he was open to receiving representations not only from Government Members but from all Oireachtas Members.  We left the meeting feeling rather confident that in due course there would be a positive outcome on all of the cuts made.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader if will be possible to have a discussion on Seanad reform early in the new term after the recess.  We have talked a good deal about Seanad reform which we have achieved to a small degree.  Much of it has been internal and not received the attention it deserves from the wider public.  I would like us to have a discussion on the loosening the Whip system in the Seanad.  The Whip system is the single biggest obstacle that prevents real reform taking place.  I have supported measures that I might not ordinarily have supported but not doing so would have automatically meant losing the party Whip.  I have spoken several times about this.  I have to balance whether it would be worth losing the party Whip on something that might not be a core issue for me if it would remove any influence I have in areas in which I could make a real difference.  Mental health is a particular interest of mine.  When we return after the recess, perhaps we might schedule a substantial and comprehensive debate on how we could go about reforming the House without having to resort to constitutional or statutory change or even changes to Standing Orders.

She was modest in her comments about her involvement.  I am encouraged to hear what Senator John Gilroy has had to say was about his meeting with the Minister yesterday; just because Ministers do not drop the work they are doing to come to the House to debate an issue with us does not mean that they are not actively working on it.  I have every confidence that advocacy services will be reinstated, as they should be, in the near future.<\/p><p>I mention an issue I have mentioned on numerous occasions, that of roaming charges in the European Union.  In recent months we have seen such charges across Europe fall as a consequence of work being done by the European Commission.  Only two weeks ago a cap was put on data roaming charges across Europe, which would see the charge for browsing the web while abroad capped at 20 cent per megabyte.  That charge is still too high, but it represents serious progress, as the charge has been reduced from approximately 80 cent per megabyte about one year ago.  I am disappointed that the telecommunications companies - this should not come as a big surprise - are looking for every loophole possible in the legislation and do not seem keen to embrace, even though they say they are, the pro-consumer, pro-business and pro-tourism moves of the European Union on this front.  There are many instances of where people tether - I did not know what this was until I read more about it - or use their mobile phone to allow use of iPads in browsing the Internet, for which they are charged about &euro;5 a day.  Without going into the details, it seems that loopholes are being used by the telecommunications companies.  I am supportive of the European Commission's continued push in this area to quash roaming fees and ensure a pro-consumer and pro-business regime is fully implemented.  That is the intention of the policy and legislation being produced by the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700007#F01800","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1405591800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests in the Visitors Gallery.

It was amazing to see how he could remember every move on every board as he moved around the hall.  While he did not match the record, he had won six of the games, drawn two and lost two by the time it was called off.  He had played from 5 p.m. until 11.30 p.m.  The Irish Chess Union is to be congratulated for organising such an event.  It informed me last night that it did not receive one bean of funding from any Department.  I do not know if chess is a sport recognised by the Irish Sports Council, but if it is not receive any funding to keep this fantastic game going and that should change.  We should support the union to include chess in the schools curriculum, particularly when we are in the era of iPads, iPhones, i-this, i-that and i-the-other.  Our concentration spans have suffered a great deal as a result.  The teaching and coaching of chess in schools would impart valuable lessons to children about the consequences of actions, strategic thinking and being rewarded for doing the right thing.  Chess or ficheall boards have been found in archaeological digs throughout the country.  It is part of what we are and it would be sad if chess skills were lost owing to a lack of support.  I will be calling on the responsible Minister, whether it be the Minister for Education and Skills or the the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, to provide some funding for the Irish Chess Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700007#F01900","speaker":"1119","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405592400,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I raised yesterday with the Leader the issue of price increases for student accommodation in the various campuses around the country.

With this in mind, I ask the Leader to provide the House with a progress report on the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) (Amendment) Bill which is to introduce a deposit protection scheme.

I gave a very comprehensive report yesterday on funding to support national organisations in the community and voluntary sector.  I outlined that the overall budget for the scheme was &euro;8 million and went through the details of the scheme.  I said there was an appeals process, of which I am sure the organisations refused funding will avail.  No later than last evening, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Paudie Coffey, stated in the Adjournment debate that he and the line Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, had discussed the issue of funding for community and voluntary organisations and decided that where an organisation was providing assistance for people with medical conditions, the review under way would give it special consideration.  There is light at the end of the tunnel in relation to that funding.  This issue is connected to matters Senator Feargal Quinn raised in respect of competitiveness and the need to stick within budgets.  One of the main issues of concern of the National Competitiveness Council was the need for Ireland to maintain its fiscal probity.  Stable and healthy public finances are a prerequisite for growth.  The Government must maintain a balance in all of these areas.  I am sure the review of the matters referred to by Senator Mark Daly will, as the Minister of State said, bear fruit for the organisations concerned.<\/p><p>Senators Ivana Bacik, Michael Mullins, Kathryn Reilly, Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh and others referred to the situation in the Middle East.  The deaths of four young children were appalling.  There is a temporary ceasefire in place for a number of hours, which is little consolation to everybody involved in Gaza.  I hope the international community and the European Union will ensure the ceasefire will become permanent to allow these unfortunate people to get their lives back.  There has been a need for many years to settle the issue in the Middle East.  The Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan, will do everything possible, in particular, on the humanitarian side, as well as on the political side, to obtain an agreement in the Middle East to deal with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which has been ongoing for far too long.  Many innocent people have suffered and lost their lives during the years.  I will certainly ask if we can have a Minister come to the House today.  There is a motion before the House on tomorrow's business; therefore, it will be out of the question tomorrow.

It has been commented on by a number of Members.  <\/p><p>Senator Feargal Quinn raised the issue of competitiveness and referred to very interesting findings.  We have a great deal of work to do in that regard.  I have mentioned one of the key areas of concern which requires policy attention - stable and healthy public finances.  Another is the need to support productivity-enhancing investment action which is required to enhance credit flows for enterprise.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Bill which will be before the House today will address that issue.  The Minister for Finance said on Second Stage in the House that the Bill represented one of the most significant developments in the area since the foundation of the IDA.  The Government is certainly addressing the concerns of the National Competitiveness Council in that regard.  Other concerns have also been addressed.<\/p> <p> I note Senator Quinn has raised on a number of occasions the question of food waste, which should be addressed by all the parties involved in that sector.  I raised Senator O'Sullivan's concerns with the relevant Minister, and I can do no more than that.<\/p><p>Senator Kelly raised the question of discretionary medical cards.  I am sure this will continue be addressed.  Many of those cards have been restored to people who appealed at the time.  I am sure, if there are any difficulties, they can and will be sorted out.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to a HIQA report on a nursing home.  I would urge the Senator to give any information he may have on that issue to the Minister, who I am sure will be very interested.  I can assure him any HIQA report will be followed through comprehensively by the Department.<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke noted the health committee will now be allowed to proceed with its work in investigating how the &euro;3.72 billion for the 2,600 organisations is spent.  He also highlighted once again the plight of junior doctors and the need for greater reform of the system.  I was concerned at Senator Burke's statement in regard to agencies that people may not have the qualifications listed in job applications.  That is a very serious charge and it should certainly be investigated, not alone by the health agencies but by the Garda, if wrong descriptions are being given.  People's lives could be put at risk if that is the situation.<\/p><p>With regard to Senator Healy Eames's point, as I said yesterday, we in this House have no say on who should or should not be a Minister.  I am sure the Taoiseach had a very difficult job because there are so many talented people from both parties.  However, in regard to gender equality, this Government has introduced legislation whereby a 30% quota will now be in place for the next general election.  That is action rather than words.<\/p><p>Senator Gilroy mentioned Seanad reform. We have a comprehensive suite of proposals to put forward.  One of the proposals which I certainly will be trying to have is that when people on the Order of Business raise a subject, they would at least have the courtesy to wait for a reply rather than moving out of the House.  I have tried to do that but I would be unfair to people on the other side of the House because I can see who is gone on the other side but I cannot see who is gone behind me.  I will have to curb that in the future.  I would hope that Members who raise their relevant points on the Order of Business would at least stay for a response, be they satisfied or not with that response.<\/p><p>Senator O'Keeffe spoke on the question of end-of-life care and the report of the health committee and the Ombudsman on that matter.  I would like to point out to the Senator that we had a Private Members' motion from Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell on this matter in April.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, gave a very comprehensive outline of the Government supports in this regard but I will certainly see if we can have a further debate on it in the context of the reports which have come out recently.<\/p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan commented on and commended the work of NAMA in certain areas.  Senator Noone raised the work of the European Commission on roaming charges and the improvement in the situation, while stressing there is a need for further improvement in that area.  She pointed to the fact telecoms are dragging their heels and looking for loopholes, although it should not be news to us that they are doing that at every possible opportunity.  The work of the European Commission in this regard is certainly to be commended from a consumer point of view.<\/p><p>Senator Heffernan complimented the work of the Irish Chess Union.  I do not know where I can turn the Senator to in regard to funding but I am sure the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport will certainly listen to what he has to say.<\/p><p>Senator Hayden raised the issue of student deposits being retained by various groups.  I will find out for her the current status of the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) (Amendment) Bill to which she referred.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I thank the Cathaoirleach, the Seanad staff, the ushers and all the staff of the House for their courtesy during this term.

Similar provision is made in relation to duties of the Clerk of the Seanad.  For example, section 4(4) of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1947 provides that whenever the office of Clerk of the Seanad is vacant or the Clerk is unable through illness or other cause to fulfil his or her duties, the Clerk Assistant of the Seanad shall act as Seanad returning officer.  Another example is the provision in the Electoral Act 1997 for the establishment of a constituency commission to report on D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies.  Section 7 of the Act provides that the Clerk of the Seanad shall be a member of the commission.  Section 8 of that Act provides that whenever the Clerk of the Seanad is unable to act as a member of the commission through ill health or other cause or where the office is vacant, the Minister may appoint the Clerk Assistant of the Seanad to be a member of the commission.<\/p><p>The Electoral Acts are not, however, consistent in making such provision and this short technical Bill addresses this anomaly in the Acts.  The anomaly came to notice when consideration was being given to the making of the by-election order to fill the vacancy in the Seanad arising from the election of Senator Deirdre Clune to the European Parliament in May.  The vacancy has arisen on the Oireachtas sub-panel of the Cultural and Educational Panel.  The legislative provisions on filling the vacancy are set out in Part 5 of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1947 which requires the Clerk of the D&aacute;il to perform specific functions in the by-election process.  These include sending to the Seanad returning officer a &quot;statement of the names, addresses and descriptions of all the members of the D&aacute;il who are then entitled to sit and vote in that House&quot;.  On receipt of that statement, the Seanad returning officer prepares a list which forms part of the electoral roll for the by-election.<\/p><p>As the office of Clerk of the D&aacute;il is vacant and there is no provision in the 1947 Act for a person other than the Clerk of the D&aacute;il to furnish the necessary statement to the Seanad returning officer in relation to the electoral roll, the by-election could not proceed in accordance with the Act.  This anomaly came to light when notice was given last month under section 55 of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1947 of the casual vacancy in the Seanad arising from Senator Deirdre Clune's election to the European Parliament.  This is an unsatisfactory and anomalous situation which is addressed in the Bill.<\/p><p>Rather than just dealing with the immediate difficulty of the Seanad by-election, the Government decided to examine the issue more widely.  Therefore, the Bill addresses the entire electoral code where similar difficulties could arise in the future, both in regard to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and the Clerk of the Seanad.  It provides that, in certain circumstances, the Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il will perform the functions of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and that the Clerk Assistant of the Seanad will perform the functions of the Clerk of the Seanad.  These circumstances arise where either the office of Clerk of the D&aacute;il or the office of Clerk of the Seanad is vacant or the Clerk is unable through illness, absence or other cause to fulfil duties under the Electoral Acts and no provision is made for another person to perform the relevant functions.<\/p><p>I will outline the details of the Bill.  Section 1(1) provides that if and so long as the office of Clerk of the D&aacute;il is vacant or the holder of that office is unable through illness, absence or other cause to perform his or her functions under the relevant statutory provisions, the Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il shall perform these functions.  Section 1(2) lists the &quot;relevant Acts&quot; and &quot;relevant statutory provisions&quot; referred to in section 1(1).  The functions are those in the Electoral Acts that are the duties of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and where no provision is made for any other person to fulfil the duties in the absence of the Clerk.  Section 2(1) makes similar provisions for the Seanad.  It provides that, if and so long as the office of Clerk of the Seanad is vacant or the holder of that office is unable through illness, absence or other cause to perform his or her functions under the relevant statutory provisions, the Clerk Assistant of the Seanad shall perform these functions.  Section 2(2) lists the &quot;relevant Acts&quot; and &quot;relevant statutory provisions&quot; referred to in section 2(1).  The functions are those in the Electoral Acts that are the duties of the Clerk of the Seanad and where no provision is made for any other person to fulfil the duties in the absence of the Clerk.  <\/p><p>Section 3 contains standard provisions dealing with the Short Title, construction and collective citations.<\/p><p>This is a short technical Bill.

The Bill takes a sensible and pragmatic approach to addressing the inconsistencies in the Electoral Acts on this point and I commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700011#K00600","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1405593900,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Bill, but it is outrageous that the situation is allowed to continue where no Clerk of the D&aacute;il has been appointed.

It is not his fault, as he has only been in the Cabinet since this week.  It is the fault of the Government, including the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin; the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Taoiseach.  Senators cannot blame Fianna F&aacute;il for this one as the issue arose last year.  The Minister is new to the job, in which I wish him the very best.  I am delighted he has been appointed to it.<\/p><p>It is amazing to see newly appointed Ministers coming into the House this week, whom we all wish the best of luck, who have not had the chance to take a second look at the legislation put before them.  I see Ministers in the D&aacute;il answering questions on issues about which they cannot know much in their first few days in office.  They should have taken a breather on legislation and questions to apprise themselves and look at matters afresh in the Department.  They have the summer to do so on most issues and I urge them to take that opportunity.  They are elected to give their views and appointed by their leaders because of their talent and insight and their parliamentary party members, as well the public, expect this from them.<\/p><p>This is stopgap legislation while the position of Clerk of the D&aacute;il remains unfilled.  This issue came to light last week when the Government lost a vote and, all of a sudden, legislation is being rushed through.  What has happened between the Ceann Comhairle and the Government is an unseemly spat that is continuing and does not reflect well on the day-to-day running of the national Parliament.  No Clerk of the D&aacute;il, a critical member of staff, has been appointed.  While we are talking about the post of Clerk Assistant of the Seanad, I congratulate Mr. Martin Groves who was recently appointed to the position.<\/p><p>I would love to oppose the Bill, but I cannot stand in the way in holding a by-election to the Seanad.  That would be undemocratic, but we need answers on what is happening between the Government and the Ceann Comhairle.  Legislation such as this which has an impact on the workings of the House should not come from the Government but from the Houses.  Part of the problem is that, despite all the talk, we do not have a separation between the Government and the Parliament.  The work of the Parliament on a day-to-day basis is mandated and directed by Ministers and officials in Departments.  I say this with no disrespect to them because that is the system we have in place.  We would like to see a Clerk of the D&aacute;il being appointed in the proper way, respecting the independence of the Parliament.  We will support the Bill and will not stand in the way in holding a by-election which the Government will surely win owing to the electoral system.  I hope, however, that there will be competition within the parties for the seat and that there will not just be one candidate.  Under our stewardship, there was more than one candidate from Fianna F&aacute;il running for these positions.  <\/p><p>I would like the Minister to address the issues raised, but we genuinely wish him the best of luck.  The Bill should have been held off until he had had a chance to look at it over the summer and discussed it with his colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700011#K00900","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1405594500,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  What is proposed in the Bill must be done because the need for it dates back to 1947, when the principal Act was brought into force.  I do not know who was in power at that time - perhaps one of my colleagues can inform me - but whomever it was left an anomaly in the original legislation.  As matters stand under the existing Act, if the Clerk of the D&aacute;il or the Clerk of the Seanad becomes ill, there is no one to take his or her place.  We know that those who have occupied those positions in recent years are great people.  I pay tribute to Mr. Kieran Coughlan, the former Clerk of the D&aacute;il who retired recently.  His shoes will be hard to fill.  I also pay tribute the very fine Clerk of this House.  There may have been times when neither she nor Mr. Coughlan were available to fulfil the duties assigned to them under the 1947 Act and the fact that, under the Act, no one would have been available to take their places is an anomaly.  The Bill before the House provides that the Clerks Assistant of both Houses can step into the breach if the Clerks are indisposed.<\/p><p>Under the 1947 Act, by-elections cannot currently take place because there is no Clerk of the D&aacute;il in the aftermath of Mr. Coughlan's retirement.  As the Minister indicated, the Bill is a technical amendment to the existing Act.  I accept that there are other changes which must be facilitated, including appointments, etc.  I do not know when the position changed in respect of Government seats in the Seanad becoming vacant and the matter being referred to the relevant panel in order that it might elect a replacement Member.  Perhaps we should consider re-empowering the various panels again in this regard.  The latter has never been done and it is not facilitated under the legislation before us.  Perhaps the matter could be dealt with in the context of Seanad reform.  It is not on the agenda for today and it would be leading people astray if we were to pretend that it is.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for coming before the House.

Senator Byrne explained his concerns very well in respect of it.  Why has the position of Clerk of the D&aacute;il remained vacant for over a year?  I just cannot understand why that is the case.  Now, we are changing the law.  The Minister has explained why the latter is happening but he did not indicate why the position of Clerk of the D&aacute;il, which was previously held by Mr. Kieran Coughlan for quite some time, has remained vacant.  The atmosphere in the Seanad has become very healthy in recent times.  This is a result of the fact that we are obliged to debate everything because the Government does not have an automatic majority.  That has been a welcome development.  Last week, Senator Crown tabled a very sensible amendment and won the ensuing vote in respect of it by a margin of one - 27 to 26.  This makes the Seanad very sound and democratic.  We debate every matter in the knowledge that the balance could go one way or the other.<\/p><p>In the period 1994 to 1997 one Government fell and was immediately replaced by another without an election.  The previous Taoiseach's nominees remained Members of the Seanad and suddenly there was no longer a Government majority here.  That was particularly helpful to the five Independent Members of the House - there had been six of us but one of our number became the Labour Party Whip - because we held the balance of power in many instances.  This meant that Ministers were obliged to take account of our views.  I recall on one occasion being approached by the then Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Mervyn Taylor, who sought to convince me that we needed to change something we had done the previous week.  The debates which took place in the House at that they were both robust and good and this was due to the fact that the Government did not have an automatic majority.<\/p><p>What the current Government is doing in the form of the Bill before us is changing the law in order to regain its majority in the Seanad.  That is a disgraceful affront to citizens who were promised more democracy when the Government lost the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad.  What is being done here is hypocritical, particularly in view of the fact that the Taoiseach promised a &quot;democratic revolution&quot; in 2011.  We have been waiting three years for real Seanad reform.  It is extremely regrettable that the Government has resorted to this solution which is being rushed through the Oireachtas and about which, as Senator Byrne indicated, we only found out last week.  I wish the Government would place as much emphasis on concrete reform of the Seanad.  One of the simplest and most straightforward ways in which we might improve democracy in this country would be by making the Seanad more democratic and giving it increased powers in order that it might take a second look at legislation and provide the necessary counterweight to the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>The group Democracy Matters, of which I was a member, campaigned in last October's referendum on that basis.  We did not campaign for the House to be retained in its current guise, rather our aim was to have it reformed.  Our goal was to create a new, democratic Seanad in respect of which everybody would have a vote.  Last year's referendum was, unfortunately, the first occasion on which many citizens had been in a position to cast any kind of vote in respect of the Seanad.  How long will they be obliged to wait until they can do so again?  The Government must extend the right to vote in respect of elections to his House.  Senator Crown introduced a Bill on the matter, which was accepted, as have Senator Zappone and the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators.  All three Bills provide solutions that can work.  We can and should have a democratic Seanad, without the whip automatically forcing everybody on the Government side to vote in a particular way on each occasion.  One Government Senator indicated earlier that he has, on occasion, been obliged to vote against his own best judgment because he was instructed to do so and did not want to lose the whip.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700012#L00700","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1405594500,"counter":120,"content":"<p>What about those in Fianna F&aacute;il today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700012#L00800","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1405594500,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I suppose the situation is the same.

Most Ministers will tell us the next general election will not take place until the spring of 2016, which gives the Government sufficient time to carry out real, meaningful Seanad reform if it is serious about it.  The next time we will be debating Seanad politics in this House, I hope it will be as a result of the Minister having taken seriously what the people said last autumn, namely, that they want an updated, modernised Seanad playing a role in the democratic process of the State, with every citizen having an equal vote in Seanad elections, irrespective of what system we devise.<\/p><p>There is a technical Bill before us today to allow the by-election.  Obviously, it will be approved and the by-election will take place.  I have been around the Houses long enough to know how by-elections are conducted.  With the overwhelming Government majority in both Houses, a candidate representing a Government party will obviously win the seat.  There is a Fine Gael vacancy.  I am not sure whether the strategy for the seat is part of the revised programme for Government but I presume it will go to the Fine Gael Party.  While I am not in a position politically to lecture the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party or its managers, I certainly hope that whoever puts his or her name forward for election to this House will at least have been neutral during the Seanad referendum campaign last autumn.

There were many Fine Gael public representatives, particularly councillors, who not only opposed the referendum but certainly voted against abolition.  I hope the successor to Ms Deirdre Clune will be from the ranks of people who supported the Seanad last year.<\/p><p>It would just add to the public's already deeply cynical view of politics if somebody who said the Seanad should be abolished sought election to it.  I know from my knowledge of the Fine Gael organisation and Fine Gael local authority members across the country that a majority of the latter were opposed to the abolition of the Seanad.  I hope it is from the ranks of those people who supported the Seanad that our new Senator colleague will emerge.  The successful candidate will enter a Seanad system that is still operating under the old electoral process and old view of what the Seanad is or should be.  I hope the main substantive debate on the Seanad over the next 18 months will not be about by-elections or a by-election-facilitating Bill but about the reform of the House.<\/p><p>Just as all of us in politics have a shelf life, the Minister will have a shelf life in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  He may transfer to other positions - I had better not say better positions.  His time in the Seanad was brief and he moved on to European politics.  In the European Parliament, he met colleagues whose parliamentary systems had two houses equivalent to the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  He met people who believed parliaments should be debating fora rather than dictatorial fora.  He will have met Members of the European Parliament who did not simply chant party lines but thought and voted in a very independent fashion.  I hope the Minister's experience in this regard will lead him to believe we could have a much better Seanad and that the starting position will have to be based on an electoral system in which every citizen is respected and has an entitlement to vote.  I hope that will be his Seanad project between now and the next election.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister well with his endeavours.

No disrespect whatsoever to the office of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il but I strongly suspect the problem has not been finding a suitably qualified person.  I do not believe it is a case of finding someone uniquely qualified.  It is impossible to escape two conclusions, one being that the problem has not been fixed because of a manifestation of some kind of power struggle between official officers of our democracy - not including the Minister - or those who represent the highest levels of government and those who represent the Chair of the D&aacute;il.  There is a somewhat less savoury interpretation, which is that because so many of these jobs sadly become a manifestation of political patronage, there is no concordance regarding the one or two people earmarked for the job.  I have real difficulty in understanding why this matter should be regarded as an emergency today and why it could not have been fixed earlier.  I am not an obsessive, nerdish follower of the arcane processes of parliamentary procedure.  I looked up today the date on which the last incumbent resigned and saw July.  I believed movement was pretty quick until I saw the date was July 2013, a year ago.  It was all over the newspapers that this was happening a year ago.  Why is it becoming such an issue today?  The Minister has been given the thankless job of representing a policy that clearly has been in place but which is wrong.  It is just not the way this should happen.  The job should have been filled a long time ago.<\/p><p>I have a very specific question that the Minister probably cannot answer today.<\/p> <p>What level of expense is involved in passing a legislative measure, rather than just appointing the person last year?<\/p><p>There is also an opportunity cost associated with passing legislation because other legislative measures will not be passed or will be delayed or will not be drafted because the expertise of the people who draft and scrutinise legislation must be used in drafting this legislation.  I know from experience that a Bill we tried to pass two years ago on something as simple as banning smoking in cars where children were present which we had hoped would be in place to stop children being exposed to cigarette smoke during their summer holidays in 2012 was delayed for two years because we were told the people who drafted Bills were desperately over-worked and understaffed.  I will seek a division to make a tetchy protest &quot;No&quot; vote on this issue.

I believe I sat in front of the Minister in the last Seanad.  It is good he has this role because he has an understanding of this House, what it can do and what it could do, if it was given teeth.  It is good that this is now in his remit and I believe history will be kind to him if he grabs hold of it.  Let us face it, the Government has been less than decent in how it has perceived and handled the Seanad.  The Minister now has a leadership role in that regard.  I also take the opportunity to congratulate my former colleague, Deirdre Clune, on winning a seat in the European Parliament, thus vacating her seat in the Seanad.<\/p><p>I wish to make three points.  Undoubtedly, other Senators have asked this question, but why has the post of Clerk of the D&aacute;il not been filled?  As Senator John Crown said, the post was vacated one year ago, but it had been flagged for months in advance.  We knew the vacancy would arise.  We have read the speculation that the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Sean Barrett, had a disagreement with the Taoiseach, that there was jockeying for the position and about who should get it.  Fundamentally, until we get rid patronage and favouritism and bat for professionalism and competence, we will not be in touch with what the people want.  This cute hoorism must leave politics.  We all know that it is happening every minute of every day.  We need only look at how the positions were allocated in the reshuffle.  I spoke this morning about the three Gs - how geography lost out in terms of those from Galway and the west; how the Gaeltacht and Gaeilge lost out and how gender lost out in terms of women losing out.  However, that is not the reason I am contributing to this debate.  I have asked my first question as to why the post has not been filled and when we will start to bat for professionalism and competence.<\/p><p>In conversation with a person outside the House last night I said one of the things that made me have a great deal of confidence in Ireland was the hearings we held last year when we invited professionals to appear before Members.  They were psychiatrists, doctors and legal professionals.  When one leaves the professional world and comes into this one, one is in danger of forgetting the professional standards in society.  While the post in question remains unfilled, the same  is happening here.  We are saying there are no competent professionals among the public, which is not true.  I agree with Senator John Crown.  The Government is blocking the Bill, not the Members of the House who vote against it, although I do not doubt that it will be passed.<\/p><p>The second point that must be made concerns the importance of listening to what the people said in the referendum.  They said they wanted this House to be retained and reformed.  They want it to have adequate teeth to hold the Executive to account.  That means, at least, a vote for every person.  The Minister's big challenge is to ensure there is universal suffrage, not just university suffrage which, while it would benefit me and others, would still leave 75% of the population outside the loop.  It also still leaves the House at risk of being called elitist, something I abhor.  Unless we heed the result of the referendum, we are answering in the negative the question, &quot;Do people and democracy matter?&quot;<\/p><p>A new job has come into existence that is becoming very important to companies.  It is about analytics in the social media world.  People are being hired to see what is being said about companies.  Big companies such as Vodafone, Meteor and others are investing in people to engage in analytics to get to the back story of what the public thinks about them.  We have been told by the public what it thinks of this House and that it wants to retain it.  Can we, please, just pay the public a little respect and enact legislation?<\/p><p>I support what Senator Paul Bradford said.  When the candidate is nominated by the Government parties - I do not doubt that it will be a Fine Gael candidate - I hope it will be a woman, given that a woman vacated the seat and in view of the poor gender allocation we saw this week.  Second, above all, let it be someone who is not hypocritical and wished to abolish the House.  It really is outrageous that Senators on the other side of the House openly campaigned to abolish the House but still remain in it and take a salary.  That is the utmost hypocrisy.  I wish the Minister the best of luck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700014#N00400","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1405595700,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I support the Bill which is a technical measure.

I do not believe there is a huge variety of talent among the public that is equipped for this task.  I remember that when I was elected to the House a number of years ago, there was a very distinguished Clerk of the Seanad, Mr. Kieran Coughlan, who went on to become Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  He played a very significant role in a quiet way.  However, the tradition, practice and law up to now has been that the Cathaoirleach wrote to the Taoiseach with a name and the Taoiseach nominated that person.  This Bill represents a very significant and dramatic stripping away of the powers of this House.  I oppose it for that reason alone.  It is clear - it is a fact - that the Taoiseach is intent on grabbing as much power as he possibly can.  That is very undemocratic.<\/p><p>On the question of reform of the Seanad, the Government's moves in this regard have been laughable.  It has done absolutely nothing.  It has looked at tinkering with the university seats in a disastrous way.  The only element that is democratic, in which the ordinary members of the nominating body are enfranchised, is under attack.  We are already democratic, but the Government is expanding the electorate to 850,000 voters for six seats.<\/p> <p>In respect of the next group of 43 Senators elected by delegated universal suffrage there are fewer than 1,000 voters, all of whom are politicals instructed by their parties how to vote.  They have 43 seats.  Then one has the golden ticket of the Taoiseach's nomination.  He nominates 11 Members without even a farce of an election.  By its alleged reform, the Government is increasing and maximising an already glaring discrepancy.  My colleague, Senator Sean Barrett, introduced legislation which would have increased the university seats satisfactorily while taking a seat here or there from some of the other groups.  That was defeated on the instructions of the Government.  People have talked about whipping and it is clear that the Government has handed down instructions on how to vote in this matter to its own side.  It is also clear that Fianna F&aacute;il Members have been instructed how to vote.  It is extraordinary that the overwhelming majority of Members of this House have been instructed by the D&aacute;il what to do to strip away the Seanad's powers.  Anyone talking about hypocrisy, as one of the preceding speakers this morning has, can see it there.  For those clear and simple reasons, I will vote against the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700014#N00700","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405596300,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, back to the House.

I wish her very well in her role as an MEP.<\/p><p>The main question on this side of the House is why the vacancy which arose on 5 August last year has not been filled.  There has been a public spat between the Ceann Comhairle and the Taoiseach, which has done nothing for the lower House and democracy in the State.  If the Bill before the House was introduced after the filling of that vacancy, there would not be a difficulty.  It makes perfect sense to me that in the absence of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il through illness or otherwise, the Assistant Clerk should be able to carry out the same duties.  The Bill is being supported by Fianna F&aacute;il for that reason.  It is also being supported because we do not want to prevent a by-election in respect of a seat in this House.

I see no reason that provision should not be made for this in the legislation.  If one of the aims of these provisions is to promote competition, we should set about it in a very straightforward way.  If the model we are using is based on Germany's KfW, we should not exclude the possibility of the SBCI doing whatever that bank can do, including lending directly into the real economy.<br \/>As I pointed out on Second Stage, one of our concerns is that the retail banks will simply soak up the funding available from the SBCI and instead of passing it on to small and medium-sized enterprises, as is the intention, will favour preferred customers, which may well be larger companies.  Allowing the SBCI the capacity to lend directly would, if nothing else, keep the banks on their toes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700018#T00400","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1405597500,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I welcome the constructive intention of the Senator's proposal to amend the section dealing with the purposes of this legislation, but I am not in a position to accept it.  The business model of the strategic banking corporation of Ireland is based primarily on the on-lending model which is operated successfully by KfW in Germany, ICO in Spain and others.  The SBCI is being set up initially as a wholesale funder that will work with various on-lenders.  The objective is to minimise the overhead expense of the operation and leverage the existing networks and capabilities of on-lenders for the benefit of SMEs.<\/p><p>In building any organisation from start up, it is practical to phase in its development.  Where we are seeking to deliver funding to SMEs in the quickest and most cost-effective way, it is appropriate initially to have on-lending arrangements with institutions that have existing networks throughout the country.  In a situation where commercial banks work with the SBCI and new competitors are facilitated and welcomed, an additional branch network on its own would add no value.  Given that the vast majority of loans issued to the SME sector in this country are for amounts of less than &euro;100,000, a cost-effective on-lending model works best.  Direct lending is more likely to address larger borrowing requirements and can, therefore, be facilitated from the SBCI's own infrastructure.<\/p><p>In this way, the SBCI will ensure SMEs receive the best value possible.  Critically, however, the provision of credit directly from the corporation is not precluded under the legislation.  Although the intention is to facilitate indirect lending in the first instance, a combination of the provisions in subsections 2(b)(ii) and 8(1)(a) will ensure both direct and indirect lending are possible.  Indeed, these sections legally empower the corporation to become involved in direct lending.  This is likely to happen in the medium term once the organisation is up and running.  Consequently, the amendment is not necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700018#T00500","speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405597500,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1405597500,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<blockquote><br \/>In page 6, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:&quot;(j) to avoid procyclical investment cycles.&quot;.<\/blockquote>I welcome the Minister to the House.

There is a clear intention for the SBCI to act in a counter cyclical manner and I am informed by the Spanish model for their development institute, ICO, which acts in an accordion-like fashion, expanding and contracting their operations as need be.  It is important to reiterate that the purpose of this Bill, when enacted, is to encourage the giving of credit in a prudent manner as set out in section 2(<i>a<\/i>) and to facilitate the availability of credit in the State to benefit the economy and economic well-being of the State.  <br \/>As Senator Barrett highlighted himself during the Second Stage debate the pre-crisis credit boom was fuelled primarily by property speculation and asset-based lending with limited investment in the real economy.<br \/>In marked contrast the SBCI has been designed to increase the availability of longer-term flexible debt finance, which is appropriately priced, thereby providing SMEs with access to the type of patient intelligent capital that will increase productive investment, encourage growth and thereby generate additional employment opportunities.<br \/>The SBCI will at one level operate in a counter-cyclical manner in seeking to compensate for any constraints in the provision of financing to enterprises and in particular SMEs.  In the years since the international financial crisis a number of Governments have utilised similar state-sponsored financial institutions to address cyclical financing constraints by increasing the scale and scope of their lending activity.<br \/>It is accepted, however, that regardless of the economic and financial cycle, there will always be structural problems in the market that constrain SMEs in accessing credit.  This is a feature of SME funding across the OECD.  In particular innovative firms, small firms and firms early in their life-cycle would appear to be more affected by such market imperfections.<br \/>These structural imperfections or constraints will also tend to be exacerbated by financial crisis as was the case with the impact of the international financial crisis since 2008.  Crisis enhanced constraints may also persist beyond the return of broader financial stability. <br \/>Furthermore the SBCI will also operate with a broader developmental mandate that will enable it to channel investment towards key strategic sectors of the economy.  Although the initial operations of the SBCI will focus on supporting SMEs other strategic sectors could also be supported in the future.<br \/>Arguably the financial crisis has also served to crystallise a longer-term developmental problem for Europe in terms of its capacity to finance productive investment, particularly in the SME sector.<br \/>By seeking to address cyclical and structural constraints in the credit market in a manner that provides benefits to the SMEs, the economy and indeed the State, the SBCI will avoid the speculative short-term approach to lending that characterised the period leading up to 2008.<br \/>While I endorse the sentiment behind Senator Barrett&rsquo;s amendment we consider that the functions of the SBCI as outlined in this section of the Bill are sufficient to not only address his concerns but, more important, will ensure that the SBCI provides improved credit that is tailored to the needs of SMEs and in so doing contribute to the achievement of more sustainable and long-term economic and employment growth.<br \/>I will undertake to have my officials reconnect with ICO and investigate the inclusion of appropriate language covering counter-cyclical operations in the memorandum and articles of association of the company. <br \/>Rather than accepting the amendment, I am making a commitment that after consultation with ICO, we will include provisions to achieve what he proposed in the memorandum and articles of association of the company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700019#U00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1405597800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I am very much indebted to the Minister and for that reason I will withdraw my amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700019#U00300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405597800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405597800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Section 2 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405597800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Sections 3 and 4 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405597800,"counter":174,"content":"<p>SECTION 5<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1405597800,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<blockquote><br \/>In page 7, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:&ldquo;(7) The SBCI shall apply for a banking licence.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>I discussed this issue on Second Stage and that is the reason I tabled amendments on Committee Stage.  In the programme for Government a commitment was made to establish a strategic investment bank.  There is a dire need in society for a lender to the private and commercial sectors.  There is an appetite to establish a real State-led investment drive.  A bank has a banking licence.  The Bill proposes a strategic banking corporation, which to some may sound like a bank but as all Members of the House know, it is not a bank.  We believe there should be a State bank lending to the real economy.  By applying for a banking licence, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, which is being established under the Bill, will be able to play a wider range of roles than the narrow remit it currently has.  I know there have been vague commitments that this might happen in the future but there is no reason that the application process should not happen straight away.  <br \/>I will press my amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700019#U00700","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1405597800,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I will follow on from Senator Reilly's point.

If the banks are not doing what the Minister expects them to do in terms of lending this money out into the economy, then the SBCI could do it.  The only way that SBCI could do that is by having a banking licence.

The purpose of my amendment was to ensure this bank would not be involved in personal loans, financial intermediation and investment in property.

Therefore, I understand from what the Minister said the other day that there is no possibility the corporation could be enticed into these areas which did so much damage to the Irish economy.<br \/>The last thing the Irish economy needs is a banking system obsessed by property, financial intermediation and personal loans.  The Minister is trying to do something different.  I gather that under the rules he is implementing from KfW and the EIB, this outcome is already addressed.  Should the Minister confirm that this impression of mine is correct I will not be pressing the amendment.

It can have strong social as well as economic outcomes.  At a time when a country has been through a recession and high unemployment it is so important to give life throughout the country.  We often hear many worthwhile proposals in the form of social entrepreneurship.

The best thing to do is to describe briefly how I envisage the new credit institution, SBCI, will operate.  First, it will be a wholesale bank.  That means we will receive funds from KfW bank in Germany, from the European Investment Bank and also from our own strategic investment fund in Ireland.  It will do that each year and on-lend, but it will not set up a network of high street bank branches.  Its model will be to provide wholesale funding in tranches to banks such as AIB and Bank of Ireland, and also to other lending institutions, which will on-lend.  We will see it developing and increasing its functions over time.<\/p><p>Let us suppose one has an SME, in whatever activity one likes to select, and one wants to expand it.  Traditionally, one could not get ten-year money from AIB, Bank of Ireland or any of the other banks and one could not get an interest holiday.  If the person knows the business will not be profitable until year three or four, he or she can get an interest holiday up front and a new type of lending.  Then AIB, Bank of Ireland or any other agent bank will be bound by the contract it has for the provision of funding from SBCI and it will on-lend.  It is envisaged that at a later stage the SBCI will get involved in a wider range of activity.  It is mandated in the legislation that it will be involved in projects which have an economic or environmental dimension and return to the country.  That means they are not excluded but enabled to do so.  We see it as a further development, as the model works in practice.  <\/p><p>The next phase will be like the amendment that Senator Reilly tabled to allow the bank to be involved as a retail lender.  They are empowered under legislation to be a direct lender to businesses rather than going through the on-lender process.  Again, we see that as a development down the line and not in the first year or two of operation.  It meets the various suggestions that various Senators have made, but later in the timeline.  It does not exclude, anywhere in the legislation, lending for social entrepreneurship.  That is a possibility as well, but it is not specifically mandated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700022#X00100","speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405599300,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405599300,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Sections 9 and 10 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405599300,"counter":193,"content":"<p>SECTION 11<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1405599300,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 5 and 7 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700022#X00500","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1405599300,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<blockquote><br \/>In page 9, to delete line 38.<\/blockquote>The purpose of the amendments is to afford the Minister the option of a mixed model rather than the current set-up as stated in the Bill, which states: &quot;The Minister shall be the sole shareholder.&quot;  I commend him on getting AIB and KfW involved.

It seems our general intentions in this area are well aligned.  However, on this particular point of detail, I cannot change the text of the Bill as it is.<\/p><p>The particular subsection deals with the potential payment of callable capital if required.  It is desirable to use callable capital as it facilitates the provision of funding by the SBCI to external funders without the need to guarantee that funding.  This is the method by which EIB gives comfort to its lenders that their funding is secure.  The use of such callable capital by the SBCI may be possible in future but will not be possible at the start.<\/p><p>Callable capital operates on the basis that the borrower sets its level of capital at a level high enough for its lender to be comforted by the fact that the borrower has sufficient loss-absorbing capacity.  This capital does not need to be paid to that level from day one but rather simply enabled to be paid at that level.  Crucially, the borrower must not be restricted from paying in capital to agreed levels if the pre-agreed circumstances arise.  The borrower must respond within a contractually agreed timeframe by injecting the callable capital into the company, and section 11(6) enables such an injection.  Given the importance of the subsection for giving effect to the time-limited action, it would not be helpful to require the Minister to seek other sources of funding at the time when she or he needs to act without delay.  Furthermore, the Minister may be in a less than desirable position in terms of being able to negotiate a price at the point where the capital has been called.<\/p><p>I have already outlined why, in general, it is important that the SBCI be established with the Minister as the sole shareholder.

However, I am suggesting that as we put the public finances together again, we should use legislation to firmly rule out this form of ministerial guarantee, which has led to many legal costs and troubles.  If ministerial permission is to be given, it should be of the form specified in section 18 as it stands.  There should be no more letters of comfort.

What he is trying to do in this Bill is most important in that we are trying to set up a new institutional framework to repair what happened to us in the past.  It has to be a new beginning and he certainly has my support in that regard.  If the amendments are of assistance, that is fine, as we discussed earlier with the Minister, Deputy Noonan.<br \/>The amendments concern &ldquo;appropriate qualifications&quot;.  With regard to the exercising of functions which were heretofore within the Department of Finance, the Wright report at page 6 states that the Department: does not have critical mass in areas where technical economic skills are required; has too many generalists in positions requiring technical economic and other skills; is more numbers driven, than strategic; does not have sufficient engagement with the broader economic community in Ireland; often operates in silos, with limited information sharing; is poorly structured in a number of areas, including at the senior management level; and is poor on human resources management.<br \/>Later, he complained that, of 542 staff, just 39 had qualifications in economics at masters level or above.<\/p> <p>He compared us unfavourably with Canada, where the rate for those with such qualifications is approximately 60%.  <\/p><p>This is a new and important task, for which we need the human capital.  That is the reason the amendments have been brought forward.  The NTMA needs this expertise, particularly in view of what Mr. Bob Wright said in the report about how these decisions had been made previously.  The context, as we said on Second Stage, was that we remove from a very high debt-to-GDP ratio what the banks had cost us.  As not much of it is represented by the current budget deficit, it leaves the balance in the area of capital investment appraisal, which is what the NTMA sets out to do.  It is important for everybody that the agency succeed and has the human capital it needs to succeed.  We need higher level qualifications which traditionally were not present in much of the work done in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700024#Z01400","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405600500,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for bringing forward his amendments.  On the first amendment, I appreciate that he is concerned to ensure members of the agency are well qualified and suitable for appointment.  I assure him the Minister for Finance shares that concern.  It is because we share that concern that we have included a detailed list setting out relevant areas in which potential appointees must have expertise and experience at a senior level.  However, I must put it to the House that we cannot be overly prescriptive because if we take, for example, the area of investment - the first area of expertise mentioned - we are likely to find that there are perfectly suitable candidates who came to it with a background in engineering, mathematics or the liberal arts.  We should not, therefore, be too prescriptive in legislation in this regard.  We are clear on the expertise we need, but our concern is that the Senator's amendment would be overly prescriptive.<\/p><p>The Senator also proposed reducing the requirement for expertise in &quot;economics and economic development&quot; to &quot;economics&quot;.  I am not persuaded by this proposal.  I can envisage a situation where a person could have a useful background, not necessarily in conventional economics but perhaps in working with a development bank at a senior level.  That individual might have first hand experience of investment and working with developing economies which could be very useful to the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, in terms of investment strategies.  Again, a person with that background would have to have expertise and experience at a senior level.<\/p><p>In regard to the proposal to expand the phrase &quot;corporate finance&quot; to &quot;corporate finance and appraisal&quot;, I do not see how this would add to the area of expertise.  If we are looking at someone with expertise and experience at a senior level in corporate finance, I would be very surprised to find that that person did not have expertise in appraising the finances of a corporate body or its activities.  <\/p><p>The Senator's rationale in moving the amendments is that he does not want senior civil servants to be eligible for membership of the agency.  That would unnecessarily exclude potential worthwhile appointees.  The provision is wider than departmental civil servants, being civil servants of the State, and includes persons working in other organisations such as a utility or energy regulator.  It is important to note that the Civil Service is much more open than it was and we see people being recruited at all levels, right up to Secretary General level, from outside the Civil Service.  Therefore, if we look at the roles of the agency, it could well be that a civil servant, whatever his or her career background is, who has particular expertise in an area such as public capital projects would be a very good fit for the ISIF which has the potential to invest in public infrastructural projects just as much as it does in SMEs, provided the investment is on a commercial basis.  I am satisfied that the provisions within the legislation cover the qualifications required to be a member of the agency.  The provisions are reasonable and should remain as they are.  I respect the Senator's view, but that is my rationale for not accepting the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700025#AA00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1405600500,"counter":236,"content":"<p>We must do things differently.  Mr. Bob Wright referred to problems such as people operating in silos and projects not being properly examined, leaving us with a project that did not generate a return, with the debt incurred mounting up all the time.  There must be a radical change.  I was pleased to hear what the Minister of State had to say because we cannot have a repeat of what happened in the past.  For years, the public capital programme was just a wishlist, with nothing being available on the economics to indicate why one project was a better investment than another.  We are all aware of areas where that was the case.  For example, engineers dominated in many infrastructural projects and this accounts for many of the difficulties the country faces.<\/p><p>The lack of expertise in economics was noted in the Wright report.  I hope we can get the number up in that regard to compare with Canada which had neither a banking nor a public finances crisis.  Some 60% of Treasury staff in Ottawa are qualified to Masters level and above in economics; perhaps that is not a bad idea.  I am nervous about promoting from silos and people not keeping up with fast developing subjects.  The Minister of State mentioned liberal arts graduates.  I am nervous about the culture of generalists in the public service.  It served us well in the past, but the country collapsed in 2007-08, which is why we are looking for something new.<\/p><p>I am pleased with the discussion, but it is a major issue for the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister of State that the standard of presentation of the public capital programme heretofore would not satisfy a second year undergraduate.  There are further concerns.  Recently the Institute of Public Administration which was publishing a book on expenditure appraisals asked me to include an article in it.  I said the article had whiskers on it and asked if there was anything more modern that could be included, but there was not.  If we spent a fraction of the budget on appraising and publishing it in advance to have it assessed by Ministers, the Houses and independent economists, this would be a significant improvement.  That is the culture from which I presume the Bill is trying to move away and it is in that spirit that the amendments have been proposed.<\/p><p>My concern is that people will say the Bill passed through the Seanad on the second last day of the session and that nothing needed to be changed.  A lot needs to change.  I am delighted that the Minister of State who is in office for just a couple of days is here to promote it.  We must do better than we did in the past and this is part of the reform agenda.  Reform is happening, but perhaps it might have been done on the first day of this Seanad three years ago.  I will not push the amendments, but economics is a serious subject.  Mr. Wright found that only 39 out of 582 working in NAMA were qualified at Masters level.  This is about large amounts of public money.  We cannot depend on wishlists in the hope that it will all work out well on the day.  This is about part of an economy that had to be rescued by the IMF.  That is the spirit in which the amendments have been brought forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700025#AA00300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1405600500,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response to Senator Sean D.

However, it is important to recognise that the NTMA was set up in response to some of these concerns and that it has proved to be a responsive State agency.  I do not believe the difficulty arises in the evaluation of projects but in turning the train around.  Too often in the past, it has been impossible to move, derail or turn the train in any other direction.

We have had a discourse in which the public sector has been pitted against the private sector.  There has been significant change, but a great deal more change is needed.  I acknowledge that the reform agenda is far from finished.  Public procurement, which is my new area of responsibility, is an exciting area in which we must seek to get value for the taxpayer in public projects.  It is important to note that we have a Department with responsibility not only for public expenditure but for reform.  The job of reform is never done, but I do not believe the way to do it is through these amendments.<\/p><p>In the context of these amendments, we discussed the issue of qualifications and, in particular, the qualifications of people within the Department of Finance.  It is important to note that for the past few years it has been recruiting on the basis of qualifications for which there is a perceived need in the Department.  Even in times of a moratorium on recruitment, when numbers in the public sector are decreasing, it is important to note that the Department of Finance has tried to recruit in the areas of economics, finance and accounting, and I am sure this is a policy that will bear fruit in the culture within our Departments.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett also raised the issue of appraisal of public expenditure projects.  Obviously, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for this.  <\/p><p>I will read into the record the official points that must be gone through.  Prior to approval in principle of public projects, a cost benefit analysis should be submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for its views.  In particular, the central expenditure evaluation unit will provide an assessment of the robustness of the appraisal based on compliance with the principles and methodological norms of the public spending code.<\/p><p>I accept the sentiment expressed by Senator Hayden that a significant amount of reform has taken place in our public services in very difficult circumstances.

In response I would point out that it is important to note that NewERA does not have any executive functions in its own right.  It is being established in an advisory capacity as a source of dedicated, corporate finance expertise which will be available to relevant Ministers.  The Minister can request NewERA to provide project management services or to oversee the acquisition or disposal of an interest in or assets of a designated body or any winding up, reorganisation or restructuring of a designated body.  Ministers will continue to be accountable to the Oireachtas in the normal way for the performance of their executive functions.  That is where I would disagree with the Senator on the need for this amendment, because this is not conferring executive powers on NewERA; it is merely establishing NewERA to carry out the important role of providing advice.  The policy and executive decisions remain very much with the Minister.<\/p><p>With respect to the disposal of an interest in a designated body, the commercial semi-states are all established under legislation in a variety of ways and they have statutory functions and obligations.  There is no one simple answer to the question of whether a Minister could dispose of an interest in a commercial semi-state body.  I will give the House a few examples.  The State companies generally have legislation permitting the disposal of assets or shares in certain subsidiaries, subject to ministerial consent.  The ESB, for or example, has been able to sell individual power generation assets without the need for additional primary legislation.  The sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy, however, required primary legislation because the business we sold - namely, the supply of gas - was a statutory function of Bod G&aacute;is.  In regard to Bord na M&oacute;na, section 16(3) of the Turf Development Act 1998 provides that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform &quot;shall not, unless authorised by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann by resolution to do so, reduce his or her holding of shares to less than a majority of the issued shares&quot;.  There is a clear obligation in that instance for the Minister to seek the authorisation of the D&aacute;il.  Given that the commercial semi-states on which NewERA will advise are all established under statute, it is very difficult to imagine a situation in which any of the designated bodies could be sold without amending the underpinning legislation.  A critical point here is that a potential buyer would inevitably seek legal certainty before committing to acquiring a designated entity.  <\/p><p>I must emphasise the point that while Ministers may request that NewERA provide property management services or oversight in relation to the disposal of an interest in a designated body, NewERA cannot do so in its own right, and a Minister can ask NewERA to do only things that he or she has power to do already.  Ministers will remain accountable to the Oireachtas and will need to bring required legislation through the Oireachtas and justify it there in the normal parliamentary way.  <\/p><p>The effect of this amendment, ironically, would be to take away from the Minister the possibility of seeking further expert advice from NewERA where it is proposed to acquire or dispose of an interest in a commercial semi-state or to wind up, restructure or reorganise a semi-state.  Without this provisions Ministers would ask their Departments to look after the proposed acquisition or disposal in the normal way.  They might even hire consultants to do so.  This provision means that Ministers will be able to draw on the expertise of a dedicated public service entity instead.  That seems to be a good thing. <\/p><p>Following on from the exchange I had with Senator Barrett on the need to broaden the pool of advice and to be able draw on new expertise, in that sense, the addition of NewERA as an advisory body to a Minister when he or she is considering any of these issues is, in my view and the view of the Minister for Finance, a good thing, and for that reason I will not be accepting the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700026#BB01000","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1405601100,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Senator Reilly, is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700026#BB01100","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1405601100,"counter":250,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700026#BB01200","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405601100,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405601100,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Section 19 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405601100,"counter":253,"content":"<p>SECTION 20<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1405601100,"counter":254,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 16 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.

I think it is actually quite a big jump to add in expenditure under the public capital programme and I will outline the reasons for saying that.  NewERA has been set up to provide financial and commercial advice to shareholding Ministers on designated bodies and also, at the request of other relevant Ministers, advice in relation to other State bodies that have not been designated.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 7 would allow Ministers to request NewERA to provide advisory services or project management on expenditure under the public capital programme.  I have a basic reservation about this proposed amendment.  We have defined - I refer to my exchange with Senator Reilly - NewERA's primary role as an adviser to Ministers on commercial semi-state companies.  We further built upon that to say that NewERA can provide project management or oversight in relation to acquisitions and disposals of State assets and winding up and restructuring of State bodies generally where a Minister has an interest.  However, it is a big jump to extend the remit beyond that to advise and project manage in relation to the public capital programme generally.  We have already done something like this with the National Development Finance Agency.  As Senators will be aware, the NDFA procures public private partnerships on behalf of the Exchequer and provides financial and risk advice on capital expenditure projects in excess of &euro;20 million.  Its remit was extended further in 2013 to allow it to procure schools directly from the Department of Education and Skills, because it was realised that additional resources were needed to ensure that the extensive programme of school building was delivered successfully.  We can redirect resources when needed, but we would not be inclined to do so unless we felt there was an immediate need.<\/p><p>In respect of amendment No. 8, in the name of Senator Barrett, it goes without saying that one of the foundation stones for NewERA is improving the rate of return on public investment.  That is why we want to bring together this expertise and that is the reason we want to have an option for Ministers to engage and seek advice from such expertise.  Senator Barrett proposes to insert the phrase &quot;improving the rate of return on public investment&quot; in section 22.  While we may not have used that precise formula of words, I think it is clear from section 19, which defines NewERA's core advisory role, that it refers to NewERA advising on the &quot;financial and commercial operation, including the rate of return on capital expected for the designated body and the appropriate dividend policy for the designated body&quot;.<\/p><p>Subsection 4 requires the agency to have regard to the objective of seeking the effective and efficient application of capital by the designated body taken as a whole.  I think it is fair to say that improving the rate of return on public investment is part of what NewERA is about and I feel it is adequately addressed in those sections.<\/p><p>Turning to amendment No. 16, we are carrying over the NDFA provisions from the NDFA Acts 2002 and 2007, adjusted to take account of the dissolution of the NDFA board and the fact that the NTMA will be taking over the NDFA function directly.  The role of the NDFA is to provide a financial advisory service to State authorities in respect of capital projects over a certain size, at present &euro;20 million.  The third Schedule to the Bill lists the State authorities to which the agency in its NDFA role provides advice and financing on public investment projects.  The list is quite extensive, covering Departments, local authorities, colleges, transport bodies and harbour authorities - in short, the public bodies that one would expect to have significant capital expenditure.  This list is carried over directly from the National Development Finance Agency Act 2002 and section 29 of the Bill provides that the list of bodies can be added to by order of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Given that the NDFA provides advice on projects costing more than &euro;20 million, it does not seem necessary to extend the list of bodies to include any public body that has money to spend under the public capital programme.  It is a straightforward procedure to add bodies to the list and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is vigilant in ensuring that public bodies have access to the financial expertise of the NDFA where appropriate.  Therefore I feel it is adequately addressed in that Schedule, and I do not propose to accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700027#CC00100","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1405601700,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I have rather held back on getting involved in these amendments as Senator Barrett is such an expert in this area.

It is important to say that we are not seeking to assign any new functions to the NDFA; we are seeking simply to transfer the NDFA's functions to the NTMA.  Section 26 (c) provides that the NDFA may enter into PPPs on behalf of a State authority and transfer the rights and obligations under the contract to the State authority once the PPP arrangement has been put in place.  In simple terms, the NDFA is a centre of excellence working with relevant State authorities to put PPP commercial contracts together in a standardised and consistent way before they are handed back to the State authorities.  The contracts will then be administered directly by the State authorities rather than the NDFA on the authorities' behalf.  PPP arrangements do not contemplate the transfer by a State authority of its rights and obligations under a PPP to a third party, and this makes the amendment proposed to this subsection unnecessary.  Section 26(d) provides that the NDFA may act as an agent of a State authority in entering into a PPP contract.  The contract for the PPP will include provisions for exit from or termination of the PPP, and therefore we find it unnecessary to make such specific provision in legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700027#CC01500","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405601700,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405601700,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1405601700,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 12 is in the name of Senator Barrett.

While I understand that Senator Barrett is trying to add further scrutiny and a further pool of expertise, I am not sure that it is particularly appropriate.  For a start, the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General is to issue recommendations.  Those recommendations are then examined by the relevant Departments including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and they may issue guidelines or instructions to State bodies.  That process is in place already.  Similarly, in relation to amendment No. 13, the concept of policy guidance is too vague.  Any such policy guidance issued by the Comptroller and Auditor General or the Committee of Public Accounts would, if accepted, normally be implemented via a communication from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Finance, as appropriate.  This process creates a single point of responsibility for issuing guidelines and clarity for the NDFA in adhering to guidelines in force.  It is important to note that reports of the Committee of Public Accounts are not necessarily policy.  They are laid before the House and debated.  It is up to individual Departments to consider that.

The agency can invest on a purely commercial basis, in other words, not focusing on the employment and economic benefits to the extent that it does not have investment opportunities that meet the economic and employment criteria immediately available to it.

I am seeking that, in order that Ministers do not direct projects and force the agency to comply, there should be some parliamentary participation, hence the reason I included the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am uneasy about directions with which people have to comply, even if the agency states that all its advice is that a particular project is not a good one, one can be compelled under subsection (4).  I suggest a useful stopgap would be to run it through the Oireachtas committee to assist in better decision making.

Stepping back from this formal requirement for the agency to report on its investments through that manner I would also expect that directed investments would become public information very quickly.  The Minister for Finance can direct the agency to invest in financial institutions only if necessary and in the public interest to remedy a serious disturbance to the economy and or to prevent potential serious damage to the financial system.  It is highly unlikely that the Minister would direct investment in financial institutions if those institutions have access to other sources of private capital.  In that scenario it is likely that it would also be in the public interest to make a directed investment public knowledge in order to restore confidence in the financial system.

Is it not time that the risks in PPPs were shared?  That is the purpose of my opposition to the section.  I would like to see some risk sharing.

The section amends the State Authorities (Public Private Partnerships Arrangements) Act 2002 by adding a section that will allow Ministers to issue guarantees or indemnities in respect of PPP projects, with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  Such indemnities or guarantees have been essential in recent years in order to secure funding for projects from international financial institutions, such as the European Investment Bank, where a sub-sovereign entity, such as the National Roads Authority, NRA, is procuring the project.  A ministerial guarantee may also be required to ensure an appropriate credit rating for a PPP undertaking in such cases.  Such borrowing has been available to us at preferential rates and has enabled us to fund schools and roads projects that might otherwise have had to be put on the long finger.<\/p><p>The purpose of the proposed amendment is to provide a statutory basis for Ministers to issue letters of indemnity or guarantees to funders to PPP companies or in respect of PPP projects.  The advice of the Attorney General has indicated that such a provision is appropriate if the practice of Ministers issuing such letters is to continue.  The provision formalises an implicit State liability because a Minister providing the guarantee or indemnity will generally be funding the State authority through the departmental Vote.  For roads, for example, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport would vouch that he or she would be liable for the payment obligations of the NRA should the NRA fail to pay, as per the terms of the PPP.  The Minister would vouch that he or she would make the payments to the NRA that he or she would have made anyway.  I trust this explains why we included the provision in the Bill.  It is to ensure we can access cheaper funding from international financial institutions for PPPs in particular.  All Senators will be aware, as I am, of the importance of delivering critical infrastructure such as schools and roads, and this mechanism allows us to do so.

I have only been in my new role a short number of days.  I want to take time to talk to people, to listen to what they have to say, to reflect on what I find and then to focus on some achievable priorities.  The core aim of the health service is to maximise the health of the population and to allow people to participate as fully as possible in the social and economic life of the community.<br \/>First, I acknowledge the impact narcolepsy has both physically and emotionally on the lives of those affected and on their families.  Sufferers can experience excessive daytime sleepiness, sudden and temporary loss of muscle tone often triggered by emotions such as laughter, known as cataplexy, intense, vivid and sometimes terrifying hallucinations and sleep paralysis.  Many teenagers and young adults also experience emotional distress due to their illness.  Dealing day to day with this illness affects not just their lives, but also those of their family members.<br \/>Immunisation is a simple, safe and effective way of protecting people against certain diseases.  Immunisation against infectious disease has saved more lives than any other public health intervention, other than access to clean water.  Before vaccines were available, deaths and serious illness caused by vaccine-preventable diseases such as smallpox, polio, TB, measles and influenza, were common.  As many vaccine preventable diseases have become so infrequent, people have forgotten the serious nature of these illnesses.<br \/>In spite of the obvious benefits that come from vaccination, I must also acknowledge there can be serious adverse outcomes for some people arising out of vaccination.  More than 1 million doses of pandemic influenza vaccine were administered during the 2009 &lsquo;flu pandemic.  Up to 16 July last, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the statutory authority for licensing and safety of all medicines including vaccines licensed in Ireland, had received 64 reports which confirm a diagnosis of narcolepsy in people who had previously received pandemic influenza vaccination.<br \/>My priority as Minister for Health, and the priority of the HSE, is that the individuals and families affected receive appropriate health care and supports.  As a result of work by my Department, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills, a range of services and supports, regardless of age, are offered on an <i>ex gratia<\/i>basis.  These services and supports, co\u00adordinated by the HSE national advocacy unit, are intended to provide that individuals receive tailored assistance to address their specific requirements.  It is acknowledged that treatment and individual medical needs may have to be reassessed over time to take account of changes in their condition or circumstances.  Consequently, the services and supports provided are reassessed on an ongoing basis to take account of any changes in the individuals' conditions and circumstances.<br \/>As Senators may be aware, legal action has been initiated by 15 families alleging personal injury in which they are claiming the development of narcolepsy resulted from the administration of the pandemic vaccine.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment further on these cases for legal reasons.  I do acknowledge the impact on the lives of these people and families affected by narcolepsy and reiterate my commitment to the ongoing provision of appropriate services and supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700031#GG01400","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1405603800,"counter":322,"content":"<p>\u00a0Approximately 1 million vaccinations were administered and an enormous supply of vaccines was made available to the State from the companies in question. \u00a0The Government gave a blanket guarantee on the basis that the vaccine was administered off-licence, even though it was administered off-licence at a time when concerns were growing in the Scandinavian countries in regard to the risk of narcolepsy and vaccination. \u00a0A number of questions need to be addressed, the most crucial of which is why so much vaccine was used. \u00a0No other country went down the route of blanket vaccinations. \u00a0How much vaccine was purchased and at what cost? \u00a0How much was left over afterwards or destroyed at a cost to the State?<\/p><p>I am glad the Minister spoke about the effects on the people who have been impacted. \u00a0The daughter of one my constituents was impacted by the vaccine.  She described the condition like trying not to sleep for 72 hours and then being expected to go about her day's work.  I know the daughter and she is a fine young person.  There is a grievance for the people involved.  I say this in a positive manner so that the Minister might take the opportunity to do something about the issue.  Information has not filtered down to GPs about what is supposed to happen to the estimated 64 people who were badly affected.  Long-term supports are lacking and, while discretionary medical cards have been provided to those affected, this is at the discretion of the HSE.  There appears to be little or no co-ordination or response form the HSE, the Department of Health or the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Early intervention is critical for those who are still at school or studying but the Department of Education and Skills has not provided any special supports.  The response of the Department of Social Protection has been particularly poor and inconsistent.  The families concerned report that there has been little or no communication between the relevant Departments and those who are affected.<\/p><p>I am hopeful that we can move to a place whereby people are satisfied with the response, in comparison to the current position whereby there is nothing but dissatisfaction.  It is 13 times more likely that somebody vaccinated with Pandemrix will be affected by narcolepsy.  I do not want the State to be liable for funds but if the State is wrong, it is wrong.  I would like to see faster and greater movement on the issue.  The reason for the court case is because of a lack of movement.

I am speaking specifically about the loss of &euro;88,000 to the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association.  Under the special scheme for financing national organisations, the association used this money to facilitate a visitor programme.  Perhaps it will be able to replace this money from within its own budget but that is not the answer.  The bottom line is that it is down &euro;88,000.  All of us know the devastating impact of motor neurone disease on anybody who has the misfortune to acquire it.  Our colleague, the late Deputy Nicky McFadden, passed away last March as a result of motor neurone disease.  I know a number of people who suffer from the disease, as well as several who are no longer with us because of it.<\/p><p>I do not think any fair minded person wants to see a reduction of &euro;88,000 because most people would acknowledge the work that the association does.  We need a long-term solution to this problem.  The national disability strategy is a good strategy but this cut flies in the face of its implementation.  This is a case of the Government governing by the head rather than the heart but there is no logic in the decision because it will have to be rectified.  In the long term, I hope that a proper multi-annual approach will be taken.<\/p><p>The Motor Neurone Disease Association exists specifically to support and advocate for people who suffer from motor neurone disease.  As it is not going to go away, it has to be supported.  Let us put in place a multi-annual programme of funding to support its advocacy, research and visiting work, as well as the assistance it gives to the families of those who suffer from the disease.  Approximately 13% of its funding comes from the State, whereas the remaining 87% is raised by volunteers.  The taxpayer and the State are getting good for money from its work.  I appeal to the Minister to include this issue in his suite of reviews.  I understand other organisations, such as the Disability Federation of Ireland, have sought a review.  I am on the board of directors of a governing body of another national organisation, the CARA centre in Tralee, which applied for funding under this programme for the first time and was turned down.  We need to take a long-term strategic approach based on multi-annual funding so that organisations and their service users are not left in a state of anxiety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700032#HH00300","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1405603800,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to address the Seanad on the funding scheme to support national organisations in the community and voluntary sector on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who cannot be here.<\/p><p>The funding scheme to support national organisations in the community and voluntary sector aims to provide multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services.  A new scheme commenced from 1 July this year.  The overall budget for 2014, including both the previous scheme and the new scheme, is &euro;3.1 million.  During 2013, a review of the scheme found that it has fulfilled its main objective of providing multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services.  The review recommended that organisations be required to demonstrate clearly the added value of the work proposed.  The effective use of core funding in recipient organisations also requires that robust governance and cost control procedures are in place in those organisations.<\/p><p>The new scheme was advertised for applications earlier this year.  Pobal were asked to undertake an assessment of the applications received, given that organisation's significant experience and expertise of both the design of assessment criteria and completion of assessment functions.<\/p> <p>Two well-attended information sessions were hosted by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and Pobal during the application process to outline the requirements of the new scheme.  Application guidelines were also issued, outlining the scoring process, which included capacity of the organisation, strategic fit, demonstration of need, achievability of the proposal and value for money.  Organisations were provided with support in the application process, including a dedicated e-mail address as a preferred contact method to deal promptly with queries, and inquiries were also dealt with by telephone.<\/p><p>Some 157 applications were received by Pobal.  Of these, three applications did not meet the basic eligibility criteria.  The remaining 154 applications were appraised by Pobal against the criteria as outlined in the application guidance.  In order to make funding available to as many organisations as possible within the prevailing resource constraints and taking into consideration the results of the appraisal process, 55 applications were approved for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016.  The Irish Motor Neuron Disease Association is not one of the organisations been approved for funding on this occasion as it did not achieve a high enough ranking to be funded within the budget available.<\/p><p>Pobal has put in place a dedicated team to deal with any inquiries from applicants and to provide detailed feedback.

I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this subject, which is causing considerable fear and anxiety not just in County Meath, but throughout the country.  Last December the then Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, announced a review of planning guidelines under section 28 of the Planning Act in respect of wind turbines and invited a public consultation.  Many people were not happy with the Government's guidelines and made their submissions.  Since then nothing has happened.<\/p><p>I understand the Department is examining all the submissions and that is taking time.  However, on the ground planning applications for wind turbines are being submitted left, right and centre, as part of which the pre-planning process has commenced for a 46-turbine project in County Meath, with each turbine almost 600 ft. high.  The danger is, as has happened in other areas in south Meath and Laois in particular, that planning permission will be granted for projects under the guidelines which the Government admits are outdated.  Speaking here last week I believe the Minister even said that the current guidelines are outdated and not relevant to the types of turbines that are going in.<\/p><p>I am suggesting, as many others have done, that the Government puts a moratorium in place until it publishes guidelines.  It should immediately publish guidelines that will be acceptable to the citizens who have to live in proximity to these turbines.  There is unbelievable anger out there.  The few Government Deputies who attend meetings will realise the anger about this.  There needs to be a moratorium.  I cannot accept it cannot be done.  I have written proposed legislation to help the process.  I believe a moratorium could effectively be put in place using guidelines under the Planning Act.  Guidance should be given to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the local authorities that they should not give permission for wind turbines until the Government has made up its mind on the policy.<\/p><p>I am looking for a positive response from the Minister.  Based on what I have heard from colleagues, I know the Minister, Deputy Kelly, is examining this issue very closely, but I would like to see a complete change of policy from what has gone on up to now.

I am taking it on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, who cannot be in the House today.<\/p><p>As outlined during a recent Seanad Adjournment debate on this matter, planning authorities, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government's 2006 wind-energy development guidelines, issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, when assessing and determining planning applications for wind-energy development proposals.  These guidelines provide advice to planning authorities on catering for wind-energy development through the development plan and development management processes.  The guidelines are also intended to ensure consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind-energy development and the treatment of planning applications for such developments.<\/p><p>A public consultation was commenced in December 2013 on proposed draft revisions to the existing 2006 guidelines, focussing specifically on the issues of noise, setbacks and shadow flicker.  These draft revisions propose: the setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind-energy developments; a mandatory minimum setback of 500 m between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations; and the complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings.<\/p><p>The Department received submissions from 2,500 organisations and members of the public during the public consultation period and the submissions, which are currently being considered, will be an important input into the final version of the revised guidelines, which will be issued to planning authorities.<\/p><p>Further work is advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the revised guidelines, when they are finalised.  It is intended to finalise the revised wind-energy development guidelines later this year and they will then be issued to planning authorities.<\/p><p>The current review of the guidelines is focussed and limited in nature, and only relates to the noise, shadow flicker and proximity elements of the existing wind-energy development guidelines.  Therefore, the remaining content of the 2006 guidelines will remain unchanged in the revised guidelines to be issued later this year.  In this context, it is not proposed to suspend the granting of planning permissions for wind-farm developments pending the publication of the specific limited revisions to the 2006 guidelines.  Planning authorities will be required to have regard to the revised guidelines with effect from their date of issue in subsequent decisions they make on proposed wind-energy developments, with the existing 2006 guidelines remaining in place in the interim.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700033#JJ00500","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1405604400,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I should have wished the Minister well in his new job as Minister for Health.

The Government gives a signal to let people know they have a few months to regularise their affairs and they will be all right.  That is exactly what has happened here.  The signal was given in December that the planning rules would be tightened up a small bit - we are hoping that they will go much further because the guidelines are not acceptable.

Cavan and Monaghan ETB has submitted detailed proposals to the Department of Education and Skills centred on the following provisions being put in place by 1 January 2015: apprenticeships training, contracted training, community training, the migration of IT systems, staffing requirements and budget transfer.<\/p><p>The former F&Aacute;S training centre located in Dundalk, County Louth was transferred to Louth and Meath ETB on 1 July.  Cavan and Monaghan ETB chief executive, Mr. Martin O'Brien, and Mr. John Kearney, the education officer, have been attempting to communicate with Louth and Meath ETB regarding the transfer share of the training budget and the associated staffing since early May.  However, to date none of the communication efforts initiated by it with the chief executive of Louth and Meath ETB have been reciprocated.  I understand the training manager of the Dundalk training centre has indicated his refusal to present an overview of training being delivered in the Cavan and Monaghan region.  This reluctance by Louth and Meath ETB to engage with Cavan and Monaghan ETB runs contrary to agreement protocols arranged by the Department of Education and Skills and SOLAS.<\/p><p>For Cavan and Monaghan ETB not to deliver its own training runs contrary to all national policy on job creation.  In specific terms, the impracticality of Louth and Meath ETB delivering training in the Cavan and Monaghan ETB area will ensure that further education and training growth potential will not be fully achieved, and will result in job creation, the benefits of the national apprenticeship programmes and the facilities of Cavan Institute and Monaghan Institute not being fully maximised.  It will also result in a lack of proper quality assurance systems and financial control frameworks for further education and training delivery in the Cavan and Monaghan region.<\/p><p>I understand Cavan and Monaghan ETB has requested the Department to appoint a facilitator to assist the engagement process between Cavan and Monaghan ETB and Louth and Meath ETB but nothing has happened in this regard to date.  The board of Cavan and Monaghan ETB takes this matter very seriously and has made it clear to me, and to Deputies Brendan Smith and Joe O'Reilly who have raised this issue in the Lower House, that it will not tolerate not having a budget to help it provide training in its jurisdiction.  The board has written to the Taoiseach seeking a meeting with him, such is the seriousness with which it takes this matter.  I look forward to hearing the reply of the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700034#KK00400","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1405605000,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his kind words.

I also thank Senator Wilson for his kind comments.  I appreciate them.  It will be nice to work with him on matters such as this, which affect us all.<\/p><p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline the position on the planning for training provision in the Cavan and Monaghan area from 2015 onwards.  The Further Education and Training Strategy 2014-2019 was published by SOLAS in April and sets out a way forward for the sector.  One of the key initiatives in the strategy is the production each year of an integrated further education and training service plan.  The first of these plans was produced this year and is available on the SOLAS website.<\/p><p>The annual planning process will be informed by an analysis of need in each ETB area and includes engagement with key stakeholders.  A comprehensive analysis of available statistical data will be undertaken to help to determine regional and local course types, with the focus on providing market-led education and training opportunities, while also supporting early school leavers and others who are further away from the labour market.  The reform of the further education and training sector envisages a key role for ETBs in the future delivery of further education and training in an integrated manner.  Part of this involves the transfer of training centres from SOLAS to ETBs.  A total of seven training centres and their staff transferred to ETBs on 1 January 2014, and the remaining 12 training centres transferred to the seven ETBs on 1 July 2014.  Each training centre, including the training centre in Dundalk which provides training services within the functional area of Cavan and Monaghan ETB, will come under the ETB in whose functional area the centre is located.  A total of five ETBs, including Cavan and Monaghan ETB, will not receive a training centre, as the Senator outlined.  There has been, and certainly should have been, extensive discussion on this matter between the ETBs, SOLAS and the Department.  I note the Senator's concerns that there was not proper consultation or that this is the prevailing view.  I will check into this and ensure this happens.<\/p><p>While recognising that the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 provides for all ETBs to have training functions, the paramount consideration for the Department is the continuity of training services for learners.  An agreed position for 2014 is in place, whereby ETBs with training centres retain primary responsibility for training and continue to provide services to areas which do not have training centres.  A process is under way to consider the position for 2015 and beyond and a number of options are being examined.  As part of this process, the Department received a proposal on 24 June from Cavan and Monaghan ETB regarding the delivery of training in Cavan and Monaghan for 2015 onwards.  I note the Senator's concern that there has not been proper consultation, a meeting has not taken place and that a facilitator is being sought, so I am glad to inform the House that as it stands, a meeting between the CEOs of Louth and Meath ETB and Cavan and Monaghan ETB has been agreed with a view to planning for training provision in Cavan and Monaghan from 2015 onwards.  This meeting is expected to take place shortly.  Both parties and SOLAS have also agreed that a representative from SOLAS will attend the meeting, having regard to the experience and knowledge of SOLAS in this area.  We will watch this space and ensure the meeting happens and see how it goes from there.<\/p><p>The Department will await the outcome of this meeting before considering this matter further and will keep in contact with those concerned.  I am confident that whatever decision is arrived at, the new ETB service planning process will ensure that Cavan and Monaghan ETB is well served with further education and training options developed on a fully informed basis for 2015 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071700034#KK00700","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1405605000,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his very comprehensive reply.<\/p> <p>If there had been extensive discussion between the two ETBs on the matter then there would have been no need for me to table an Adjournment matter this afternoon.  It is serious when one education training board, in effect, refuses to communicate with another on a matter of budget and personnel.  It is unfortunate that this matter has reached the stage of being raised in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in order for the people of Cavan and Monaghan to get fair play from the larger ETB.  This is a delicate matter for the Minister because part of the ETB we are having difficulties with is responsible for the provision of training in his county, along with the provision of education.<\/p><p>I welcome his statement that a meeting has been arranged between the CEO of Louth-Meath and the CEO of Cavan-Monaghan.  I hope the matter will be progressed in an orderly and speedy manner.
