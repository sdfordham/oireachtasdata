Vote 7, Office of the Minister for Finance, provides for the salaries and expenses of running the Department including the Office of the Paymaster General.  It also provides for the payment of certain grants.  In 2016 my Department will be required to provide for a new service, the payment of a fuel grant for disabled drivers.  This new fuel grant is being introduced to replace the excise repayment on the fuel element of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concession scheme.  As members are aware, the excise repayment was discontinued on 31 December 2014 following a ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  The new fuel grant is available in respect of fuel used from 1 January 2015 and the grant will be paid from the 1 January 2016 in respect of fuel used in the previous 12 months in the same way as the excise relief was paid in arrears.  <\/p> <p>  Since payments under this grant scheme will be required to commence in early 2016, a technical early Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000 is required under Vote 7, essentially to establish the new subhead under which these grants will be paid.  The fuel grant will cost &euro;10 million in 2016, and in a full year it is expected that some 13,700 claims will be made by drivers, passengers and organisations.  The fuel grant will be paid on the same basis as the excise repayment on fuel which will ensure that no beneficiary of the scheme loses out as a result of the EU court's decision.  Provision for this scheme was included in the Finance Bill 2015 and secondary legislation will come into force immediately after the Finance Bill is enacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015120200002#A00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1449064800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  It goes without saying there is no issue with setting up the new subhead.  I gather there is unlikely to be a payment in 2015, that this is to simply provide for the establishment of the subhead to allow payments to roll out from the start of January 2016.  The Minister outlined an estimated cost of &euro;10 million.  Is that in the same ball park as the previous arrangement?  He mentioned payments can made to drivers, passengers and organisations, which I presume are wheelchair user organisations.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify this.<\/p><p>What about a case concerning a child with an intellectual disability?  An autistic child, for example, often has particular requirements and this can be disruptive in a car.  Under the old scheme, the criteria centred on physical disabilities and were quite stringent.  Sometimes there is a requirement to adapt a car in families where disabilities might not be purely of a physical nature.  These have not been facilitated up to now.  Perhaps the position has changed but if it has not, I ask the Minister to consider including such a provision where the need arises.  Parents of children with severe Downs' syndrome may need to modify their car or get a people carrier.

The Supplementary Estimate in respect of the superannuation Vote will bring the total 2015 Estimate for the Vote to &euro;515 million gross and &euro;386.7 million net.  This compares with a final outturn in 2014 of &euro;473.9 million gross and &euro;368.7 net.  The Supplementary Estimate arises mainly from approximately 250 more retirements than were forecast for the year under the established scheme.  There are also balances payable to people who retired in 2009 under the previous Government's early retirement scheme.<\/p> <p>  Pensions and lump sums paid to members of the pension scheme for established civil servants make up just under 90% of total gross expenditure on the superannuation and retired allowances Vote.  As such, the main driver of the annual cost is the number of established civil servants who retire in the year.  However, it is particularly difficult to estimate the number of retirements from one year to the next for the following reasons.  The majority of established civil servants may choose to retire within a five-year window between the ages of 60 and 65 years.  In addition, a number of people under the age of 60 retire each year under the cost neutral early retirement scheme or are retired on grounds of ill health.  Each year, a number of former employees become eligible to claim a preserved pension entitlement, in other words, these individuals retire early but reach the appropriate retirement age in a different year and become eligible for a lump sum payment in that year.  The number of cessations of pensions also varies from year to year.  I love this euphemism, which is a way of describing those who are no longer on the planet and, therefore, unable to claim their pension.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015120200002#A00500","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1449068400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>They are brown bread.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015120200002#A00600","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1449068400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>It is a discreet way of saying that.  The average pension benefits - lump sum and pension - that will fall to be payable to new retirees in any given year will vary depending on the grades and years of service of that specific cohort of retirees.  If a number of Secretaries General retire in one year and very few senior personnel retire the following year, the costs incurred in the two years will vary, even if the number of retirees is similar.<\/p> <p>  This year, the gross Estimate for Vote 12 was &euro;474 million, which was based on a forecast of 950 retirements from the established scheme.  However, there have been 1,050 retirements as at the end of November and if the current trend continues, the annual total will be in the region of 1,200.  The effect of this higher than forecast number of retirements has been to place upward pressure on subheads A1, pension payroll, and A4, pension lump sums.<\/p> <p>  As a general rule, for each person who retires, the once-off lump sum paid out is three times the size of the annual pension.  Accordingly, increases in retirement levels have a particular effect on subhead A4, which is the most variable subhead as it provides for the lump sum payments to established civil servants.  The subhead is, therefore, a key driver of expenditure on the Vote in any given year.<\/p> <p>  By the end of November, just under &euro;75 million had been expended from subhead A4, whereas the 2014 Estimate had envisaged expenditure of &euro;66 million in that period.  Further expenditure of &euro;14 million by the end of the year is anticipated, resulting in an overall excess of &euro;23 million on the subhead.  A further expected excess of &euro;14 million on subhead A1, pension payroll, also driven by the higher than forecast number of retirements, means it is now estimated that gross expenditure for 2015 may be in the region of &euro;511 million, which is approximately &euro;37 million in excess of the gross Estimate of &euro;474 million previously approved by the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  To ensure the required funding is available, a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;37 million gross is being sought.  The select sub-committee should also note that the level of the gross Supplementary Estimate being sought will be mitigated somewhat by anticipated increased levels of appropriations-in-aid which, for 2015, were estimated at &euro;104 million.  Any additional receipts in excess of this amount will act to reduce the net effect of the gross Supplementary Estimate.  To date, receipts of some &euro;112 million have been recorded.  In particular, receipts with respect to the public service single pension scheme are growing strongly.  As Deputies will be aware, the single pension scheme for all public service employees has been operable since 1 January 2013.  This means that public servants recruited since that date pay into the single scheme.  As the value of the scheme increases, it will be offset against the cost of pensions on an annual basis.  It is likely that total appropriations-in-aid will be in excess of &euro;124 million by year end, which is &euro;20 million more than originally expected.<\/p> <p>  The requirement for a Supplementary Estimate for the Public Appointments Service for 2015 is based on the significantly increased levels of recruitment and selection activity in the service in the current year.<\/p><p>These levels of activity were not foreseen at the start of the year and all the costs are activity-led.  This is the impact of a very positive situation in the fact that we have prudent management of the finances of the country and that has allowed us to start recruiting to targeted areas of the public workforce again.  There have been large increases in demand for competitions to fill roles in the Civil Service and local authorities, as hospital consultants and trainees in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in various other specialist, professional and technical positions and all of these have driven up costs in the PAS.  Costs are driven by three main components - the processing of applications through an interview and via a series of online tests; fees paid to interview board members; and the cost of managing and administrating the recruitment process.  I am happy to answer any questions that may arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015120200002#A00700","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449068400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>There is no issue with the Supplementary Estimates for either of these areas but I will raise a few general points.

I am sure there is a security mechanism to deal with this.  On the overall vote, there is a new integrated pension scheme for all public servants which became operable on 1 January 2013.  Everybody, a judge, a Deputy, a civil servant or a garda is part of the single integrated pension scheme from that date.  The calculation of a pension is different and will be on a career average profile rather than an end-of-career profile and the implications of that will be to reduce the pension Bill by some 35%.  We are now recruiting again in significant numbers and that is impacting on the quantum of money people are paying into the single pension scheme in annual contributions.  Deputy Fleming asked me if that was offset against the net cost and the answer is \"Yes\".  It will increase into the future.  When we brought in the single pension scheme we did not think about it because, in 2011, we were in a crisis.  There might be an argument, however, for re-establishing some sort of a pension reserve fund or, at least, a bespoke fund that is transparent about the funds that are being built up.  It would have to be topped up for a number of years with annualised pensions as we go along but it might be something to be looked at in the future and I have opened a debate on the issue.<\/p> <p>  One of the most significant things to have happened within the PAS in the past 12 months is the fact that it has taken responsibility for appointments to all State boards.  An analysis of the impact was done last week by the Institute of Directors and it was uniformly positive about the effect on the skills mix of boards, the volume of applicants and gender equality.  In terms of gender equality, 55% appointed were male and 45% female so it was approaching the 60:40 ratio.  Applications received were 69% male and 31% female so the balancing carried out by the PAS equated better to the target we want to achieve.<\/p><p>We are not very far from having a proper 40% gender quota established across State boards and I am confident we can do it very quickly, if it has not already been done since this analysis was conducted.  The arbitration board is now with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  There was a real issue about appointing the right chair, which is why the chair was recruited separately.

I am glad to hear the National Pensions Reserve Fund is being discussed.  It would probably be prudent to put something in place there to start building that back up again.  The Minister spoke about cost-neutral early retirement.  For whom is it cost-neutral?  Have any costings been done on the loss of experience from people?

We do not have redundancy in the public service in general but we have cost-neutral early retirement.  That is simply if one wants to retire before reaching one's retirement age.  Actuarially, we have worked out that it is approximately 5% off one's pension and lump sum per year that one retires early so that the cost to the Exchequer is not impacted.  When I say cost-neutral, I am talking about the cost to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  Bluntly, if somebody gets to a certain age and they really want to retire, is it in the interest of the public service to keep him or her if he or she says he or she is burned out or finished?  I am not sure it would be wise to require people to work beyond that if they are within hailing distance of their normal retirement age.  There could be a whole range of family circumstances, new responsibilities, caring responsibilities and so on that might make it impossible for people to go on.  In terms of predictability, we do our best to look at what average annual retirements occur and then we look at the age cohort.  There will be particular peak years because an intake year will mature at a given point.  As there is a time horizon between the ages of 60 and 65 for people to make that choice, normally, one cannot be absolutely accurate in respect of it.<\/p> <p>  In terms of notice, principal officer grades and above are required to give three months' notice but other grades lower than that are legally obliged to give notice of only a week.  In fact, virtually everybody will give significantly more notice than that because they will want to work out what their entitlements are and to ensure that the shared service for pay is geared up to pay them on time.  To alter that, there would have to be negotiations on a sectoral basis with each of the trade unions involved.  I have looked at a minimum notice period myself because, for example, when we were mapping the exit during the difficult period, as a matter of policy, I determined that everyone should give a minimum of three months' notice.  That was adhered to, although it could be challenged.  I asked for a minimum notice of three months for practical purposes so that in a time when we were not recruiting, we could prepare to ensure that services ran smoothly where there would be a particular impact and for everyone to be paid in a timely fashion.  It is something the next Government might look at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015120200002#E01100","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1449068400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I have one last question on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015120200002#E01200","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speech","time":1449068400,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I am really stuck for time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015120200002#E01300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1449068400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>It will take two seconds.

As committee members are no doubt aware, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is a constituent part of the Office of the Attorney General and provides solicitor services within the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and to Government Departments and offices.  The office has a wide remit including the area of civil litigation in all courts, including the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg, and the provision of conveyancing, property law and general services for an array of Civil Service clients.  Many matters are high profile, sensitive, capable of attracting publicity and sometimes involve emergency applications to court, strict time limits and complex issues of law.<\/p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate is sought to cover extra expenditure on fees to counsel in 2015.  Expenditure on counsel fees is, to a large extent, dependent on the level of activity in the courts at any time and so is always difficult for the office to forecast.  In addition, recent years have seen a marked increase in the complexity of work being handled by the office in areas such as commercial litigation, transactional and procurement work, as well as advisory and litigation work resulting from our membership of the European Union and the implementation of directives in areas such as environmental law, planning, employment and social welfare law.  In areas such as judicial review, a faster throughput of cases by the courts has resulted in a marked increase in the number of fee items payable such as brief fees, fees for refreshers, consultations, advice, opinions, submissions and affidavits and a greater involvement of senior counsel.  <\/p> <p>  It should be borne in mind that the Estimate allocation for fees paid to counsel was very much reduced in 2014 due to the ongoing financial situation.  The office struggled to remain within the allocation last year and had an overspend of &euro;200,000 which it managed to cover through savings in other areas of the Vote without the need for a Supplementary Estimate.  <\/p> <p>  The management of expenditure on counsel fees is a key activity for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  These are fees payable to counsel representing Departments and offices in litigation before the Irish courts and other tribunals as well as the European Court of Justice.  They also include fees payable for the provision of legal advice for the State, whether sought for the Attorney General&rsquo;s office or for Departments and offices.  <\/p> <p>  An allocation of &euro;9.6 million was made for expenditure on fees for counsel in 2015, which was the same as 2014.  However, due to a number of factors it has not proved possible for the office to remain within that allocation.  The office has observed that the issues raised in cases taken against the State are becoming increasingly complex.  In late 2014 and into 2015 the office dealt with a major civil action in the High Court which required significant input from counsel over a long period of time.  While the fees paid to counsel in this one case were very large, the exposure of the State to damages awarded if the State had lost would have been far greater.  The office has also had to deal with a number of challenges to referendums.  The area of public procurement has also expanded in recent years and some significant challenges are beginning to arise.  This has led to an increase in the requirement to use counsel.  The office has seen a 14% increase in the services delivered by counsel in the period January to mid-November compared to the same period last year. <\/p> <p>  It is estimated that the office will have an overspend of &euro;2.5 million on fees to counsel this year.  However the office has made savings of &euro;1 million in other areas of the Vote and is now seeking a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1.5 million.  The office has made savings of &euro;500,000 in its payroll allocation due to difficulties filling vacancies at solicitor level and the retirement of senior staff at the top of their pay scale with replacements commencing at the first point on the scale.  Savings of &euro;300,000 have been made in the general administration subheads due to lower than estimated expenditure on IT systems and refurbishment work on the offices.  A further &euro;200,000 has been saved in general law expenses as the requirement has proved lower than expected at the start of the year. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure in the area in 2015 is expected to compare to the level of spend in 2013 and will still be approximately 30% lower than the expenditure in 2008, at the start of the financial crisis.  I am pleased to recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the select sub-committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI32015120200002#A00400","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1449072000,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I wish to ask one question about State legal fees and fees to barristers.  If cases were settled earlier, would it result in lower fees?  If one takes the example of the HSE, it regularly issues half hearted apologies seven years after children suffer catastrophic injuries at birth.  That seven year period would involve quite a build up of fees.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the relationship between the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the State Claims Agency because on average, if a settlement is made for &euro;1 million, the legal and professional costs add another &euro;0.5 million to the bill.  In other words, for every &euro;1 million settlement by the State Claims Agency on behalf of the HSE, by far the biggest area, the add-on for professional and legal fees is 50% on average.  That has been the case for the last number of years.  If there are settlements of &euro;60 million in full year, the legal fees are &euro;30 million.  I often feel that if State agencies were a bit more up front earlier in the process, cases would be settled more quickly.  A lot of people who take cases would be happy to settle earlier with an acknowledgement that something went wrong.

We would not really be in a position to evaluate or assess the information we get at Estimate time about the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  It is very difficult to form a view on it.  There have been celebrated cases in the past fitting into the first category mentioned by the Minister of State, that is, cases that might be deemed to have a constitutional basis but there have also been a number of celebrated cases where the advice to the State or to the Minister was the State should not mediate or settle the case because that would mean the end of civilisation as we know it.  The advice was that there would be terrible knock-on effects and so forth but I have been around long enough to know that once or twice we had to suck it and see.  After all of the delays and so forth, the outcomes were embarrassing but the house of cards did not come tumbling down.  That may well not be a matter that the Chief State Solicitor's office decides upon but it is an issue nonetheless.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the delays to which Deputy Fleming quite properly drew attention, is the Minister of State in a position to clarify the impact of the Court of Appeal?  Will that court facilitate speedier resolution of cases?  How much of this relates to how the system works, namely that lawyers determine the speed with which these cases are disposed of?  At the end of a number of years, lawyers can decide that they want to mediate, negotiate and settle but those options were out of the question earlier on.  The costs mount up and we are not really competent to say that the fees paid out are fair.  I presume the Minister of State will say that they are market prices but to the man or woman on the street, the market prices are almost incomprehensible.  Is the Minister of State in a position to say how the last eight years of recession have impacted on fees?   Have the fees dispensed come down appreciably?  Is that evident in the sense that the recession affected every other section of the community?  Have fees come down in the case of lawyers?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI32015120200002#B00300","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1449072000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Approximately 100 cases from the Supreme Court backlog are being dealt with by the Court of Appeal.
