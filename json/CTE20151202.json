Vote 7, Office of the Minister for Finance, provides for the salaries and expenses of running the Department including the Office of the Paymaster General.  It also provides for the payment of certain grants.  In 2016 my Department will be required to provide for a new service, the payment of a fuel grant for disabled drivers.  This new fuel grant is being introduced to replace the excise repayment on the fuel element of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concession scheme.  As members are aware, the excise repayment was discontinued on 31 December 2014 following a ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  The new fuel grant is available in respect of fuel used from 1 January 2015 and the grant will be paid from the 1 January 2016 in respect of fuel used in the previous 12 months in the same way as the excise relief was paid in arrears.  <\/p> <p>  Since payments under this grant scheme will be required to commence in early 2016, a technical early Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000 is required under Vote 7, essentially to establish the new subhead under which these grants will be paid.  The fuel grant will cost &euro;10 million in 2016, and in a full year it is expected that some 13,700 claims will be made by drivers, passengers and organisations.  The fuel grant will be paid on the same basis as the excise repayment on fuel which will ensure that no beneficiary of the scheme loses out as a result of the EU court's decision.  Provision for this scheme was included in the Finance Bill 2015 and secondary legislation will come into force immediately after the Finance Bill is enacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015120200002#A00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1449064800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  It goes without saying there is no issue with setting up the new subhead.  I gather there is unlikely to be a payment in 2015, that this is to simply provide for the establishment of the subhead to allow payments to roll out from the start of January 2016.  The Minister outlined an estimated cost of &euro;10 million.  Is that in the same ball park as the previous arrangement?  He mentioned payments can made to drivers, passengers and organisations, which I presume are wheelchair user organisations.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify this.<\/p><p>What about a case concerning a child with an intellectual disability?  An autistic child, for example, often has particular requirements and this can be disruptive in a car.  Under the old scheme, the criteria centred on physical disabilities and were quite stringent.  Sometimes there is a requirement to adapt a car in families where disabilities might not be purely of a physical nature.  These have not been facilitated up to now.  Perhaps the position has changed but if it has not, I ask the Minister to consider including such a provision where the need arises.  Parents of children with severe Downs' syndrome may need to modify their car or get a people carrier.

The Supplementary Estimate in respect of the superannuation Vote will bring the total 2015 Estimate for the Vote to &euro;515 million gross and &euro;386.7 million net.  This compares with a final outturn in 2014 of &euro;473.9 million gross and &euro;368.7 net.  The Supplementary Estimate arises mainly from approximately 250 more retirements than were forecast for the year under the established scheme.  There are also balances payable to people who retired in 2009 under the previous Government's early retirement scheme.<\/p> <p>  Pensions and lump sums paid to members of the pension scheme for established civil servants make up just under 90% of total gross expenditure on the superannuation and retired allowances Vote.  As such, the main driver of the annual cost is the number of established civil servants who retire in the year.  However, it is particularly difficult to estimate the number of retirements from one year to the next for the following reasons.  The majority of established civil servants may choose to retire within a five-year window between the ages of 60 and 65 years.  In addition, a number of people under the age of 60 retire each year under the cost neutral early retirement scheme or are retired on grounds of ill health.  Each year, a number of former employees become eligible to claim a preserved pension entitlement, in other words, these individuals retire early but reach the appropriate retirement age in a different year and become eligible for a lump sum payment in that year.  The number of cessations of pensions also varies from year to year.  I love this euphemism, which is a way of describing those who are no longer on the planet and, therefore, unable to claim their pension.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015120200002#A00500","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1449068400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>They are brown bread.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015120200002#A00600","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1449068400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>It is a discreet way of saying that.  The average pension benefits - lump sum and pension - that will fall to be payable to new retirees in any given year will vary depending on the grades and years of service of that specific cohort of retirees.  If a number of Secretaries General retire in one year and very few senior personnel retire the following year, the costs incurred in the two years will vary, even if the number of retirees is similar.<\/p> <p>  This year, the gross Estimate for Vote 12 was &euro;474 million, which was based on a forecast of 950 retirements from the established scheme.  However, there have been 1,050 retirements as at the end of November and if the current trend continues, the annual total will be in the region of 1,200.  The effect of this higher than forecast number of retirements has been to place upward pressure on subheads A1, pension payroll, and A4, pension lump sums.<\/p> <p>  As a general rule, for each person who retires, the once-off lump sum paid out is three times the size of the annual pension.  Accordingly, increases in retirement levels have a particular effect on subhead A4, which is the most variable subhead as it provides for the lump sum payments to established civil servants.  The subhead is, therefore, a key driver of expenditure on the Vote in any given year.<\/p> <p>  By the end of November, just under &euro;75 million had been expended from subhead A4, whereas the 2014 Estimate had envisaged expenditure of &euro;66 million in that period.  Further expenditure of &euro;14 million by the end of the year is anticipated, resulting in an overall excess of &euro;23 million on the subhead.  A further expected excess of &euro;14 million on subhead A1, pension payroll, also driven by the higher than forecast number of retirements, means it is now estimated that gross expenditure for 2015 may be in the region of &euro;511 million, which is approximately &euro;37 million in excess of the gross Estimate of &euro;474 million previously approved by the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  To ensure the required funding is available, a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;37 million gross is being sought.  The select sub-committee should also note that the level of the gross Supplementary Estimate being sought will be mitigated somewhat by anticipated increased levels of appropriations-in-aid which, for 2015, were estimated at &euro;104 million.  Any additional receipts in excess of this amount will act to reduce the net effect of the gross Supplementary Estimate.  To date, receipts of some &euro;112 million have been recorded.  In particular, receipts with respect to the public service single pension scheme are growing strongly.  As Deputies will be aware, the single pension scheme for all public service employees has been operable since 1 January 2013.  This means that public servants recruited since that date pay into the single scheme.  As the value of the scheme increases, it will be offset against the cost of pensions on an annual basis.  It is likely that total appropriations-in-aid will be in excess of &euro;124 million by year end, which is &euro;20 million more than originally expected.<\/p> <p>  The requirement for a Supplementary Estimate for the Public Appointments Service for 2015 is based on the significantly increased levels of recruitment and selection activity in the service in the current year.<\/p><p>These levels of activity were not foreseen at the start of the year and all the costs are activity-led.  This is the impact of a very positive situation in the fact that we have prudent management of the finances of the country and that has allowed us to start recruiting to targeted areas of the public workforce again.  There have been large increases in demand for competitions to fill roles in the Civil Service and local authorities, as hospital consultants and trainees in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in various other specialist, professional and technical positions and all of these have driven up costs in the PAS.  Costs are driven by three main components - the processing of applications through an interview and via a series of online tests; fees paid to interview board members; and the cost of managing and administrating the recruitment process.  I am happy to answer any questions that may arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015120200002#A00700","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449068400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>There is no issue with the Supplementary Estimates for either of these areas but I will raise a few general points.

I am sure there is a security mechanism to deal with this.  On the overall vote, there is a new integrated pension scheme for all public servants which became operable on 1 January 2013.  Everybody, a judge, a Deputy, a civil servant or a garda is part of the single integrated pension scheme from that date.  The calculation of a pension is different and will be on a career average profile rather than an end-of-career profile and the implications of that will be to reduce the pension Bill by some 35%.  We are now recruiting again in significant numbers and that is impacting on the quantum of money people are paying into the single pension scheme in annual contributions.  Deputy Fleming asked me if that was offset against the net cost and the answer is \"Yes\".  It will increase into the future.  When we brought in the single pension scheme we did not think about it because, in 2011, we were in a crisis.  There might be an argument, however, for re-establishing some sort of a pension reserve fund or, at least, a bespoke fund that is transparent about the funds that are being built up.  It would have to be topped up for a number of years with annualised pensions as we go along but it might be something to be looked at in the future and I have opened a debate on the issue.<\/p> <p>  One of the most significant things to have happened within the PAS in the past 12 months is the fact that it has taken responsibility for appointments to all State boards.  An analysis of the impact was done last week by the Institute of Directors and it was uniformly positive about the effect on the skills mix of boards, the volume of applicants and gender equality.  In terms of gender equality, 55% appointed were male and 45% female so it was approaching the 60:40 ratio.  Applications received were 69% male and 31% female so the balancing carried out by the PAS equated better to the target we want to achieve.<\/p><p>We are not very far from having a proper 40% gender quota established across State boards and I am confident we can do it very quickly, if it has not already been done since this analysis was conducted.  The arbitration board is now with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  There was a real issue about appointing the right chair, which is why the chair was recruited separately.

I am glad to hear the National Pensions Reserve Fund is being discussed.  It would probably be prudent to put something in place there to start building that back up again.  The Minister spoke about cost-neutral early retirement.  For whom is it cost-neutral?  Have any costings been done on the loss of experience from people?

We do not have redundancy in the public service in general but we have cost-neutral early retirement.  That is simply if one wants to retire before reaching one's retirement age.  Actuarially, we have worked out that it is approximately 5% off one's pension and lump sum per year that one retires early so that the cost to the Exchequer is not impacted.  When I say cost-neutral, I am talking about the cost to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  Bluntly, if somebody gets to a certain age and they really want to retire, is it in the interest of the public service to keep him or her if he or she says he or she is burned out or finished?  I am not sure it would be wise to require people to work beyond that if they are within hailing distance of their normal retirement age.  There could be a whole range of family circumstances, new responsibilities, caring responsibilities and so on that might make it impossible for people to go on.  In terms of predictability, we do our best to look at what average annual retirements occur and then we look at the age cohort.  There will be particular peak years because an intake year will mature at a given point.  As there is a time horizon between the ages of 60 and 65 for people to make that choice, normally, one cannot be absolutely accurate in respect of it.<\/p> <p>  In terms of notice, principal officer grades and above are required to give three months' notice but other grades lower than that are legally obliged to give notice of only a week.  In fact, virtually everybody will give significantly more notice than that because they will want to work out what their entitlements are and to ensure that the shared service for pay is geared up to pay them on time.  To alter that, there would have to be negotiations on a sectoral basis with each of the trade unions involved.  I have looked at a minimum notice period myself because, for example, when we were mapping the exit during the difficult period, as a matter of policy, I determined that everyone should give a minimum of three months' notice.  That was adhered to, although it could be challenged.  I asked for a minimum notice of three months for practical purposes so that in a time when we were not recruiting, we could prepare to ensure that services ran smoothly where there would be a particular impact and for everyone to be paid in a timely fashion.  It is something the next Government might look at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015120200002#E01100","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1449068400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I have one last question on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015120200002#E01200","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speech","time":1449068400,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I am really stuck for time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015120200002#E01300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1449068400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>It will take two seconds.

As committee members are no doubt aware, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is a constituent part of the Office of the Attorney General and provides solicitor services within the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and to Government Departments and offices.  The office has a wide remit including the area of civil litigation in all courts, including the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg, and the provision of conveyancing, property law and general services for an array of Civil Service clients.  Many matters are high profile, sensitive, capable of attracting publicity and sometimes involve emergency applications to court, strict time limits and complex issues of law.<\/p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate is sought to cover extra expenditure on fees to counsel in 2015.  Expenditure on counsel fees is, to a large extent, dependent on the level of activity in the courts at any time and so is always difficult for the office to forecast.  In addition, recent years have seen a marked increase in the complexity of work being handled by the office in areas such as commercial litigation, transactional and procurement work, as well as advisory and litigation work resulting from our membership of the European Union and the implementation of directives in areas such as environmental law, planning, employment and social welfare law.  In areas such as judicial review, a faster throughput of cases by the courts has resulted in a marked increase in the number of fee items payable such as brief fees, fees for refreshers, consultations, advice, opinions, submissions and affidavits and a greater involvement of senior counsel.  <\/p> <p>  It should be borne in mind that the Estimate allocation for fees paid to counsel was very much reduced in 2014 due to the ongoing financial situation.  The office struggled to remain within the allocation last year and had an overspend of &euro;200,000 which it managed to cover through savings in other areas of the Vote without the need for a Supplementary Estimate.  <\/p> <p>  The management of expenditure on counsel fees is a key activity for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  These are fees payable to counsel representing Departments and offices in litigation before the Irish courts and other tribunals as well as the European Court of Justice.  They also include fees payable for the provision of legal advice for the State, whether sought for the Attorney General&rsquo;s office or for Departments and offices.  <\/p> <p>  An allocation of &euro;9.6 million was made for expenditure on fees for counsel in 2015, which was the same as 2014.  However, due to a number of factors it has not proved possible for the office to remain within that allocation.  The office has observed that the issues raised in cases taken against the State are becoming increasingly complex.  In late 2014 and into 2015 the office dealt with a major civil action in the High Court which required significant input from counsel over a long period of time.  While the fees paid to counsel in this one case were very large, the exposure of the State to damages awarded if the State had lost would have been far greater.  The office has also had to deal with a number of challenges to referendums.  The area of public procurement has also expanded in recent years and some significant challenges are beginning to arise.  This has led to an increase in the requirement to use counsel.  The office has seen a 14% increase in the services delivered by counsel in the period January to mid-November compared to the same period last year. <\/p> <p>  It is estimated that the office will have an overspend of &euro;2.5 million on fees to counsel this year.  However the office has made savings of &euro;1 million in other areas of the Vote and is now seeking a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1.5 million.  The office has made savings of &euro;500,000 in its payroll allocation due to difficulties filling vacancies at solicitor level and the retirement of senior staff at the top of their pay scale with replacements commencing at the first point on the scale.  Savings of &euro;300,000 have been made in the general administration subheads due to lower than estimated expenditure on IT systems and refurbishment work on the offices.  A further &euro;200,000 has been saved in general law expenses as the requirement has proved lower than expected at the start of the year. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure in the area in 2015 is expected to compare to the level of spend in 2013 and will still be approximately 30% lower than the expenditure in 2008, at the start of the financial crisis.  I am pleased to recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the select sub-committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI32015120200002#A00400","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1449072000,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I wish to ask one question about State legal fees and fees to barristers.  If cases were settled earlier, would it result in lower fees?  If one takes the example of the HSE, it regularly issues half hearted apologies seven years after children suffer catastrophic injuries at birth.  That seven year period would involve quite a build up of fees.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the relationship between the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the State Claims Agency because on average, if a settlement is made for &euro;1 million, the legal and professional costs add another &euro;0.5 million to the bill.  In other words, for every &euro;1 million settlement by the State Claims Agency on behalf of the HSE, by far the biggest area, the add-on for professional and legal fees is 50% on average.  That has been the case for the last number of years.  If there are settlements of &euro;60 million in full year, the legal fees are &euro;30 million.  I often feel that if State agencies were a bit more up front earlier in the process, cases would be settled more quickly.  A lot of people who take cases would be happy to settle earlier with an acknowledgement that something went wrong.

We would not really be in a position to evaluate or assess the information we get at Estimate time about the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  It is very difficult to form a view on it.  There have been celebrated cases in the past fitting into the first category mentioned by the Minister of State, that is, cases that might be deemed to have a constitutional basis but there have also been a number of celebrated cases where the advice to the State or to the Minister was the State should not mediate or settle the case because that would mean the end of civilisation as we know it.  The advice was that there would be terrible knock-on effects and so forth but I have been around long enough to know that once or twice we had to suck it and see.  After all of the delays and so forth, the outcomes were embarrassing but the house of cards did not come tumbling down.  That may well not be a matter that the Chief State Solicitor's office decides upon but it is an issue nonetheless.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the delays to which Deputy Fleming quite properly drew attention, is the Minister of State in a position to clarify the impact of the Court of Appeal?  Will that court facilitate speedier resolution of cases?  How much of this relates to how the system works, namely that lawyers determine the speed with which these cases are disposed of?  At the end of a number of years, lawyers can decide that they want to mediate, negotiate and settle but those options were out of the question earlier on.  The costs mount up and we are not really competent to say that the fees paid out are fair.  I presume the Minister of State will say that they are market prices but to the man or woman on the street, the market prices are almost incomprehensible.  Is the Minister of State in a position to say how the last eight years of recession have impacted on fees?   Have the fees dispensed come down appreciably?  Is that evident in the sense that the recession affected every other section of the community?  Have fees come down in the case of lawyers?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI32015120200002#B00300","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1449072000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Approximately 100 cases from the Supreme Court backlog are being dealt with by the Court of Appeal.

It is important that we have the witnesses before us to tell their story because it is a very good news story.

I am the CEO of CBM Ireland and with me today is Mr. Lars Bosselmann, director of advocacy for CBM International.  On my left is Dr. Mary Keogh, a board member of CBM Ireland and also the adviser on advocacy and policy for both CBM International and CBM Australia.  I will give a brief introduction about the organisation and Mr. Bosselmann will talk about the sustainable development goals.  Dr. Keogh will speak further on Ireland's commitment to people with disabilities through the SDGs and our overseas development aid programme.<br\/><br\/>Members are probably aware that one in seven people in the world today live with a disability.  That equates to 1 billion people.  They are the world's largest minority.  CBM<b><\/b>is an international development organisation, committed to improving the quality of life of people with disabilities in the poorest countries of the world.  We do that in a number of ways.  Currently, we are working with approximately 500 partner organisations in 65 countries across Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.  We work with the partner organisations to deliver medical services, health care, community-based rehabilitation, education and livelihood opportunities for people with disabilities and their families.<br\/><br\/>When an emergency occurs in times of conflict or natural disaster, we ensure the rights of people with disabilities in those situations are not forgotten.  We partner with local organisations on the ground to provide access to emergency relief and supplies for people with disabilities.  In terms of our advocacy work both in Ireland and internationally, we work to protect the human rights of people with disabilities are met both in development policies and programmes.  We work with governments, state agencies and other development organisations to ensure we meet that goal.  I will hand over to Mr. Bosselmann who will speak further on the sustainable development goals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015120200002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah O'Toole"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449050400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Toole.  I also thank members for their kind invitation to speak before the committee.  As the Chairman has already said, in contrast to the millennium development goals, the sustainable development goals that were recently adopted and that will be in place for the next 15 years include a number of specific references to the rights of persons with disabilities.  I will start by making some reflections on why that is important and why the disability movement has fought so hard for almost the past three years to get inclusion and recognition in the SDGs of the rights of persons with disabilities.  These kind of global frameworks set and agree priorities for a long time.<\/p><p>When a topic is included, it is much easier to argue that it is important.  When a topic is not included, it is almost impossible to talk to decision makers, officials and others about it because they say \"It is definitely an important cause but it is not part of the globally agreed agenda\" and it stays as a sort of side issue.  That happened frequently with the millennium development goals, for example, in the case of disability.  We are extremely happy that the potential now exists for this to change in the context of the sustainable development goals.<\/p><p> The second point I will make is that it is important for a topic to be included in the sustainable development goals from the beginning because they will be in place for 15 years, which is a long time.  If a topic is not included, which is what happened with disability in the case of the millennium development goals, it is out for 15 years.  It is very difficult to rectify that during the course of the implementation of global frameworks that have been agreed.<\/p><p> The third point I would like to make is an obvious one.  The global frameworks determine to a large extent where the money goes.  If that were not the case, why would priorities be set?  If the cause one is defending is not part of the agenda, money will not be spent on it.<\/p><p> My final point relates to what happens when an issue is not included in an agenda such as the millennium development goals or the sustainable development goals.  What is not in is not measured.  The big advantage of the sustainable development goals from our perspective is that disability is included.  It is there, so it needs to be measured, reported and monitored.  That is one of the most significant things the sustainable development goals have the potential to achieve.<\/p><p> I will explain the importance of measurement.  As a result of the exclusion of disability from the millennium development goals, today in 2015 we have a fairly weak body of evidence with regard to disability.  There are good examples of country studies and case studies and there are good research pieces here and there, but overall we have a fairly weak body of evidence regarding how many people with disabilities there are, where they are living globally, what their needs are and how they can be included in different sectors such as education and employment.  That is why it is so important for the collection of data to be improved.  We need to have data available so that we know where people with disabilities live, what their needs are and how policies can better address their rights and needs.  We need a much better base of data and evidence than we have at present.  One of the achievements of the sustainable development goals is that they foresee making data disaggregation a reality in their implementation.  For those who want to have the precise reference, this is set out in goal 17.<\/p><p> Implementation has already been mentioned.  Of course the sustainable development goals, like all global frameworks, will only be as good as we make their implementation.  We all have a role to play - I refer to civil society, parliamentarians, Governments and UN agencies - in living up to the high expectations that have been raised.  We have to be honest and say that expectations have been raised with regard to disability and many other causes.  Of course expectations are high because disability is included this time.  We want to see progress in implementation as well as inclusion in the document.  For that reason, it is important to look at monitoring, at how to translate global goals to the national reality, at the indicators and at how to measure progress.  Parliamentarians and many others have a role to play in all of that.  My colleague, Dr. Keogh, will say a few words and offer a few thoughts and suggestions from our side on the concrete things the committee can do to make the goals for people with disabilities a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015120200002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lars Bosselmann","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449050400,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for the invite.  I am honoured to be here.  Mr. Bosselmann spoke about the international context and the sustainable development goals.  I will speak about the Irish context.  In recent years, the Government and Irish Aid have made significant progress on the inclusion of people with disabilities in Ireland's overseas programme.  As the briefing paper that has been furnished to the committee goes through that in detail, I will not allude further to it.  I suggest it is fair to say that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is largely driving the commitments being made by the Government with regard to inclusive development.  I know the Government has set out a roadmap for the ratification of the UN convention in the future.<\/p> <p>  The significance of the One World, One Future policy is that it involves a leadership approach to disability.  This progressive document commits the Government to devoting more resources to achieving equality for people with disabilities.  We are delighted to see that Irish Aid is delivering on these important commitments to people with disabilities in the developing world in areas such as human rights, public services and livelihoods.  We acknowledge that the parliamentary questions which have been discussed in recent times have given an increased visibility to people with disabilities in the overseas aid programme.  There is a commitment within that programme to look at Ireland's role in ensuring the implementation of the sustainable development goals is inclusive of people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  This is a crux time because the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the sustainable development goals have given us a foundation, for one of the first times ever, to advance the human rights of people with disabilities who live in some of the poorest countries of the world.  We strongly urge the committee, in its regular review of Ireland's overseas development aid programme and in its future progress reports on sustainable development goals, to look at ways of measuring the specific impacts these initiatives are having on people with disabilities.  Mr. Bosselmann alluded to that when he spoke about the importance of monitoring data.<\/p> <p>  We would like to see continuing engagement.  We have had very good engagement with Irish Aid in recent years through CBM Ireland and through the coalitions with the D&oacute;chas working group on disability and development.  We would like to see that continue.

I thank Dr. Keogh for acknowledging the Government's efforts to fine-tune its overseas development aid programme through Irish Aid.  I have a great deal of experience of Africa, having lived there for four years.  In comparing the facilities that are available in premier western countries to treat people with disabilities with the ability of countries like Sierra Leone that have emerged from war to look after such people, we need to bear in mind the presence of indigenous illnesses like malaria in such countries.  The effects of malaria can have a damaging effect on the brain.  Similarly, I remember that the Masai people used to put stuff on their hair - I think it was cow dung - and blindness was a significant problem for them.  When one compares the ability of various societies to treat people with disabilities as equals, it is clear that we have greater prospects in that regard in the west.  That is why the sustainable development goals are of key importance.  They reflect an international commitment to treat everybody as an equal citizen of the world.

This important area has been neglected over the decades.  Those of us who have travelled to Third World countries with Irish Aid have seen some examples of that neglect.  I would like to raise two particular issues, the first of which is Irish Aid's approach to the treatment of intellectual disability in developing countries.<\/p><p>Globally, we must ensure that disabilities are included in sustainable development goals, SDGs, and so on.  However, people in many of the countries in question think of physical disability more than intellectual disability.  In Ireland, we have spent decades working on developing thinking in this regard, so it is not unique.  It was the thinking in the western world 100 years ago or less.<\/p><p> While mental illness is an illness and not a disability, it is often included with disabilities in the countries to which I refer.  Sometimes, the treatment of mental illness falls between the two stools of disability and physical illness because of a question of interpretation.  People occasionally group intellectual disability and mental illness together but intellectual disability is a condition, not an illness.  Will the witnesses address these points?<\/p><p> I have seen extreme neglect of disability in other countries.  In India, for example, there are people with disabilities on the streets as a result of that country's caste system.  Very distressingly, I have seen people with extreme disabilities begging on streets and trying to survive while being neglected by every system.  That is how it appears, so perhaps the witnesses will clarify the position.  India is not strictly a Third World county but that could be argued.  This problem is present and the cultures of some countries have a bearing on the neglect of people with disabilities and mental illness.  A short address on this issue would be appreciated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015120200002#C00500","speaker":"1056","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449050400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>If Senator Mullins needs to go to the Seanad, does he wish to contribute now?

We have partnered with Irish Aid for a number of years.  Currently, we are co-funding a project with it in Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC.  It is a significant programme for us because we are working on community-based rehabilitation, which is focused on providing access to services for people with disabilities and ensuring their participation in providing those services.  It is a significant leap forward in how we deliver our development programmes.  The project focuses on orthopaedic care.  It is sometimes misleading when one says, &quot;Christian Blind Mission&quot;, so we say &quot;CBM&quot;.  Our founding services related to eye health but they now concern eye health, ear and hearing care, physical disability, mental health and intellectual disability.  We cover the whole spectrum of disability.  We view poverty as a cause of disability and <i>vice versa<\/i>in the communities in which we work.<br\/><br\/>In 2015, Irish Aid gave us funding to the tune of &euro;51,500 for the Goma project.  We hope to build upon that project.  We welcome that we are a recipient of a civil society fund grant from Irish Aid.  An important part of the programme is that it supplies us with good data on how to provide our services better.  They also serve as a measure of the programme's performance.  We are committed to that.  Significantly, we seek to fight the stigma of disability under the programme.  Members spoke about culture and beliefs around disability.  We have a group of community workers involved in the project who are trained.  They also have disabilities.  They go into communities to discuss the project and encourage people to participate and come forward for services.  It is an important project for us.  Obviously, we hope to build on it next year and work more closely with Irish Aid with a view to disability-inclusive development in the broader sense and a consideration of how we might assist in developing and enhancing programmes in order to ensure that people with disabilities are not left behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015120200002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah O'Toole"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449050400,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I could give an example of a project that CBM has in Ghana.

It is important for CBM International to view ourselves and the cause of disability not just as a theme that we are concerned with and working on but as a broader movement towards human rights and their realisation.

It is important to us that we fight for the same rights for everyone.  We focus on disability in our project work but we do that from a human rights perspective.

There are 17 goals and 169 targets and it goes without saying that these numbers tell us it will be difficult to achieve and make equal progress on all targets and goals.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we look at the progress we make globally and overall towards achieving the targets.  Also, every country comes at this from a different starting point in regard to making progress towards the targets.  The monitoring must make that differentiation and must understand that Ireland, Germany and others do not come from the same starting point as, for example, Malawi.  This is part of the novelty of the SDGs compared to the millennium development goals, and it is because it is global.  Of course, this also makes the monitoring pretty complex and complicated, because it can be difficult to make comparisons.  It is not really about making comparisons, but about tailoring the goals to the status of each country.<\/p> <p>  Overall, we are 15 years working in development.  This may seem a long time, but it is a short time in development.  A key target for me is to sustain the momentum that has been created around the adoption of the SDGs, not only in New York in September, so that we do not waste the next five to eight years.  The first half of the implementation phase is critical, because that is often when it becomes a little difficult to implement global frameworks.  We are also satisfied now the goals have been adopted, because we have been working already for up to three years on them - not just CBM but all UN agencies and governments.  Often after the goals are adopted, we are inclined to relax a little and take time to breathe, but that is not what should happen.  The momentum must be sustained because the next years are critical for making progress. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015120200002#E01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lars Bosselmann"},{"type":"speech","time":1449050400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I have a particular question for Dr. Keogh regarding funding for disability groups.

As members will know, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is an independent statutory body established in 1993 under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, with a wide range of responsibilities, including regulation of large-scale industrial and waste facilities, monitoring and reporting on the state of the environment, overseeing local authorities' environmental responsibilities, co-ordinating environmental research in Ireland and radiological protection.  The main role which the EPA would potentially have in regard to unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects would be its regulatory role though integrated pollution control licensing, whereby a licence would be required for onshore extraction of shale gas on a commercial scale.<\/p><p>The EPA does not have a regulatory role at the exploration stage of these projects but is a statutory consultee with respect to any environmental impact assessment conducted by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in assessing any applications received for exploration licences.  The agency on behalf of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency commissioned research into the environmental impacts of unconventional gas exploration and extraction, in particular hydraulic fracturing in shale gas.<br\/><br\/>The research programme is composed of five projects and will involve field studies, including baseline monitoring of water and seismicity as well as an extensive desk-based literature review of unconventional gas exploration and extraction practices worldwide.  No fracking will be undertaken as part of the research programme.  The five main elements include assessing impacts on surface waters, groundwaters and related ecosystems; impacts on seismic activity; impacts on air quality; international operational practice and impact mitigation measures; and regulatory regimes for fracking in different countries.<br\/><br\/>I will respond to the observations listed in the correspondence from this committee to the EPA dated 4 November 2015.  The first question related to the independence of the study.  The unconventional gas exploration and extraction joint research programme contract was awarded following a robust evaluation process in full compliance with procurement guidelines.  The contract award procedure chosen for this competition was by open procedure.  Six tenders were received.  The evaluation panel included personnel with the capacity to make informed decisions on the tenders received.  I have given details about the evaluation panel in a previous appearance before the committee.  The constitution of the evaluation panel was approved by the joint research programme steering committee.  The evaluation panel found that the tender led by CDM Smith Ireland provided the best response and a contract was awarded to the consortium led by CDM Smith Ireland Limited in August 2014.  This consortium includes commercial consultancies, academics, a geological research institution and a legal firm, each offering a particular specialism required by the project scope, as was detailed in the terms of reference.  It is stated as, &quot;The proposed project team is expected to include members who have comprehensive understanding of geology and hydrology as well as an in depth knowledge of a range of legal, environmental, health, socioeconomic and technical issues, as well as knowledge of mineral and fossil fuels (preferably unconventional gas) extraction practices and technologies.&quot;<br\/><br\/>The second question regarded the role of Queen's University.  The role of staff from Queen's University, Belfast, QUB, was to contribute to the joint research programme Project A1, which related to groundwater, surface water and associated ecosystems.  Specifically, the three researchers in the QUB groundwater group were proposed to work on a number of Project A1 tasks, leading tasks 2 and 7 and supporting other tasks.  Additionally, a full-time academic was nominated as part of the consortium's internal technical review team, with an internal review process carried out by the consortium before submission to the steering committee for Project A1.  On appointment, QUB informed CDM Smith Ireland Limited that the three researchers would not be able to fulfil their agreed responsibilities on Project A1.  Following discussion with and agreement by the unconventional gas exploration and extraction joint research programme steering committee in November 2014, they were replaced internally with British Geological Survey and CDM Smith Ireland staff taking on additional tasks.  However, QUB did not withdraw the permanent academic from the consortium's internal technical review team of Project A1.  The full-time academic from QUB has since undertaken his review role in full on Project A1, as proposed in the tender, and our understanding is that this was done with the knowledge of the university and not in any independent capacity.  The primary contributors to the overall research project in terms of staff resources are CDM Smith Ireland Limited and the British Geological Survey.<br\/><br\/>The third question was research into health impacts.  The key research questions included in the revised terms of reference - I have circulated a reference to members - and they are:<\/p><blockquote>Can unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects\/operations be carried out in the island of Ireland whilst also protecting the environment and human health?<br \/><br \/>What is &quot;best environmental practice&quot; in relation to unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects\/operations?<\/blockquote><p>The EPA launched a public consultation on the draft terms of reference in January 2013, which closed in March 2013, with 1,356 submissions received.  The EPA and the unconventional gas exploration and extraction joint research programme steering committee reviewed the submissions and the draft terms of reference were amended and strengthened after the public consultation.<br\/><br\/>Section 4 was added to the revised terms of reference to clarify and clearly define the scope of the proposed research with regard to human health.  The wording &quot;human\/public health&quot; throughout this tender document refers specifically and is limited to potential health impacts deriving from impacts on environmental media, such as exposure to chemicals, vibration, light and noise, and pollution of environmental media, such as soils, air and water.  In addition, the wording &quot;protecting human health&quot; refers and is limited to preventing environmental factors from degrading human health.<br\/><br\/>The unconventional gas exploration and extraction joint research programme will not incorporate a health impact assessment as this was not part of the terms of reference signed off by the steering committee.  However, there is a requirement in the terms of reference to specifically consider the potential role of health impact assessment in the regulation of unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects, based on the experience in other countries and to make recommendations towards developing a protocol in the island of Ireland context.  The deliverables relating to task 3, the potential role of health impact assessment in regulation of unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects,<font color=\"#0082BF\"><\/font>will include<b><font color=\"#0082BF\"><\/font><\/b>a consideration of the approaches of other countries regarding health impact assessment to include but not limited to scope, process, timing, how it is used in the planning and permitting process, who carries out and evaluates the assessment, as well as recommendations for a protocol for Ireland regarding the potential role for health impact assessment in the regulation of unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects.  The output of this task will form part of final report five.<br\/><br\/>I have circulated some examples of some specific references to &quot;human health&quot; in the terms of reference.  I will not read all of them out but the first is:<\/p><blockquote>Projects A1, A2, A3: Baseline Characterisation <br \/><br \/>Geology is the science comprising the study of solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which it evolves.  Hydrogeology is the area of geology that deals with the distribution and movement of groundwater in the soil and rocks of the Earth's crust (commonly in aquifers).  A comprehensive understanding of both these topics is a basic requirement in order to make an informed decision in relation to the potential impacts on the environment and human health which unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects\/operations may present.<\/blockquote><p>There are a number of other references in the tender that are similar.<br\/><br\/>The fourth question was on the availability and use of research outputs.  The next phase of the research project includes baseline monitoring of seismic and water resources to be completed by a supplementary tender as provided for in the framework contract for the research.  The primary purpose of this aspect of the research is to provide a greater understanding of the quality of the water resources and flow regimes and to determine the baseline seismic activity in the study areas.  The programme is intended to assist regulators, both North and South, in making informed decisions about unconventional gas exploration and extraction activities and operations.  The data obtained during the course of the current research will provide valuable information on the local and regional environment to a variety of stakeholders both North and South.  That includes Departments, State agencies, academics, people in the industry and the public.<\/p><p>The intention is that all the final and summary reports, as well as the datasets, will be made publicly available on an online EPA research data archive once the project is complete.  In terms of the timeframe, the next phase, the supplementary tender, can only be started once the interim reports for projects A1 and A2, which include tasks relating to the specifications for the baseline monitoring network, have been finalised.  It should be noted that the EPA wrote to the funders about confirming the securing of funding for the next phase, and is currently awaiting responses.<\/p><p> The last question from this committee was the intended purpose of the research.  The EPA&rsquo;s position with regard to activities using hydraulic fracturing is in no way predetermined.  The EPA is an independent body which makes decisions based on scientific evidence, and it is envisaged that this research will assist with providing such evidence on the risks and environmental impacts of this emerging technology. <\/p><p> As an environmental regulator, the EPA makes decisions on applications for licences and permits for many categories of activity.  The primary decision the EPA must make is whether to grant or refuse a licence, and under the EPA Acts the agency is statutorily barred from granting a licence to an activity which would cause significant environmental pollution.  The definition of &ldquo;environmental pollution&rdquo; in section 4(2) of the Environmental Protection Agency Act includes &ldquo;the direct or indirect introduction to an environmental medium, as a result of human activity, of substances, heat or noise which may be harmful to human health or the quality of the environment.\"<\/p><p> This research programme has been designed to produce the scientific basis to assist assessment of the environmental impacts associated with high-volume hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in Ireland.  The programme of research is intended to assist regulators both North and South in making informed decisions about fracking.  Ministers in both the Republic and Northern Ireland have publicly stated that the issuance of fracking licences will be dependent on the outcomes of a thorough, independent investigation of potential impacts on the Irish environment.  The unconventional gas exploration and extraction joint research programme will not replace, or diminish the need for, any of the statutory processes necessary to seek permission for a fracking licence or development.<\/p><p> In summary, research reports are intended as contributions to the necessary debate on the protection of the environment.  The key questions this research needs to answer are whether this technology can be used while also fully protecting the environment and human health, and, if so, what is best environmental practice in using the technology.  The question of whether the existing EU environmental regulatory framework is adequate for unconventional fossil fuel projects is also being addressed. <\/p><p> This research project will examine the potential health impacts deriving from impacts on environmental media, such as exposure to chemicals, vibration, light and noise, and pollution of soils, air and water.  The project will also examine the mitigation of environmental impacts that have the potential to degrade human health.  The research team will review health impact studies worldwide to explore the potential role of health impact assessment in the regulation of unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects or operations based on the experience in other countries, and recommendations will be made towards developing a protocol in the context of the island of Ireland.<\/p><p> In conclusion, this joint research programme aims to inform policy makers and other stakeholders on a range of questions in relation to environmental protection.  We will get a series of reports that will help regulators North and South in coming to an informed decision if and when a licensing application is received for unconventional gas exploration and extraction in the coming years.  I hope I have provided the committee with a satisfactory response to the five points of the invitation letter, and I am happy to answer any questions the committee members may have for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dara Lynott","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449048600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lynott for his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120200002#H00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1449048600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lynott and Mr. Donlon for coming before the committee.  This is not their first time and I do not think it will be their last.  I want to acknowledge the outstanding work done by groups opposed to fracking in my part of the country, with particular reference to Dr. Aideen McLoughlin, who has provided valuable assistance to those of us who need to be updated on the technical aspects of what is a very complicated process.  There are quite a lot of questions.  I know Deputy Colreavy will be putting some questions to the witnesses in the context of the information that has been provided to us.  There are quite a lot of questions, so I will try to condense it as best I can.<\/p> <p>  Not only I but also my friends and neighbours in County Leitrim, who will be severely and immediately impacted by any decision to introduce hydraulic fracturing into my part of the country, are totally opposed to it.  I will continue to be opposed to it.  It is not in the best interests of the community in which I live and it will have a devastating impact on our largest economic contributor - that is, tourism - apart from the farming impacts on the ecosystem.<\/p> <p>  How can the EPA possibly justify having a survey where the main consultant is a company that is avowedly pro-fracking?  Any investigation or research into its activities worldwide could not but come to that conclusion.  How can it be independent if it is a pro-fracking company, which has assisted in the development of hydraulic fracturing as a process and continues to do so, particularly in Poland?  How has this company ended up not only being one of a consortium of parties, as has been outlined, but also taking a leading role over the last 12 months?  If one looks down the list published on the EPA website of who is undertaking particular tasks and projects, if it is not CDM Smith, it is AMEC, another pro-fracking company.  That is the context of the question.  At the end of this process, who is going to evaluate?  Who is going to be the independent arbiter of the report once it is published?  What will happen the report when it is published?  Will a review or evaluation of the report be carried out either by the lead Department or by either of the other two Departments mentioned here?  This survey, as it is currently being operated, is so deeply flawed in the minds of those who are watching and monitoring the development of the process of hydraulic fracturing in Ireland, to the point at which I do not believe they will accept the conclusions of this report, simply because CDM Smith is directly involved.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses have gone some way towards addressing the issue of health.  One of the key questions raised by those opposed to fracking is how the operation can be carried out on the island of Ireland while also protecting the environment and human health.  It was implied that a review of the impact of fracking on human health is included in the study.  Maybe the witnesses could clarify and confirm that.  I know they have made reference to human health issues, but which task will include such a review of health, who will be carrying it out and what medical expertise does this contractor have in the context of human health?<\/p> <p>  Irrespective of the issues surrounding the process of hydraulic fracturing, one of the major concerns people have - and which I have, thinking of my family in Leitrim - is the impact on health.  Chemicals will be injected into a natural environment.  Chemicals have consequences.  They can, and will, in my opinion, interfere with watercourses.  They will create pollution.  It is perfectly obvious that the wastewater that is pulled out of hydraulic fracturing worldwide is not useable.  It is contaminated.  It raises other questions I will not go into now about what happens the millions of gallons of water used.  Where is it going to come from, and what is going to happen to it?<\/p> <p>  The definition of human health in the terms of reference is very narrow and does not consider impacts on human health caused by a number of key items.  I will not go into great detail on these, but they include radioactive releases from underground in the context of the chemicals, threats from fracking infrastructure and traffic accidents, and the risk of birth defects and fertility issues.<\/p><p>A range of issues can have an adverse impact on human health.  The conclusion is drawn that even if a review of the health impacts of fracking was carried out in accordance with the terms of reference it would be incomplete.  Does the EPA have an opinion on this?<\/p><p> My next question is on an issue which has been raised by Friends of the Earth in the very topical context of the climate change conference in Paris.  Its view is that the research does not fully address damage to the environment if it does not address greenhouse gas emissions, but this is not an issue that has been raised so far in the report's terms of reference or in the tasks being carried out.  I suggest that as the terms of reference do not require an appropriate assessment of the impact on climate change, if the Government decides to allow fracking based on this research, the decision will not be based on full information.  I agree with Friends of the Earth's conclusions that we should ensure that any research that would influence future national policy takes into consideration climate change impacts.  It is an important issue and perhaps the witnesses have a view on it.<\/p><p> Friends of the Earth raises another question which needs to be put to the EPA.  The report does not ask fundamental questions on whether Ireland should extract fracking gas; rather, it is concerned with how to frack.  In other words, the entire process screams with the view that the survey, which is led by a pro-fracking company, will conclude it is justifiable to introduce hydraulic fracturing in this country so long as the regulations are complied with and the EPA is happy that everything is regulated and complied with.  However, international evidence has indicated that compliance has not happened and does not happen, and that even in the most regulated environments, accidents have happened.  This is particularly the case when dealing with unstable chemicals.  In the environment about which we are speaking, which is in my part of the country, there is absolutely no guarantee that there will not be accidents.  This question needs to be addressed.  Is the EPA able to tell us with any degree of certainty that the survey's conclusions are not about how to frack but about whether or not we should frack?<\/p><p> As the EPA has a leading role in climate change research and policy, it is important that it address these questions.  If Ireland extracts its estimated recoverable shale gas reserves, will Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions increase, stay the same or decrease?  This is one of the tests President Obama applied to the Keystone XL pipeline, which he recently rejected in the United States.  It is a valid question to put to the EPA as the regulatory body concerned about the environment.  If all countries extract their recoverable shale gas reserves, how would it affect our chances of staying within the globally agreed target of limiting global warming to less than 2&deg;C?  Mary Robinson, along with many others, cautions that to stay within 2&deg;C globally, two thirds of fossil fuels must remain in the ground.  I pay tribute to Eamon Ryan, the leader of the Green Party, who addressed a group of Deputies and Senators at a briefing organised by Dr. McLoughlin and her allies and supporters, which was very informative.  Mr. Ryan made this very point.  He believes that in light of the existing reserves worldwide there is absolutely no need to take out two thirds of the fossil fuels which are underground.  This raises the question as to why Ireland should bother with hydraulic fracturing.  Why do we need to do it?  Why should we even be having this discussion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120200002#H00300","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449048600,"counter":167,"content":"<p>A vote has been called in the D&aacute;il, so we will suspend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120200002#J00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449048600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 10.55 a.m. and resumed at 11.20 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1449048600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>We will resume.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120200002#L00100","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449048600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I apologise in advance if I do not get all the questions.  Members might remind me if I miss anything.  The first question was on the CDM.<\/p><p>The role of the Environmental Protection Agency is the protection of the environment and as part of that, it commissions what it believes is world class research, which is peer reviewed.  That is a core part of why it is looking at the area of fracking.  I emphasise that no fracking is going to take place as part of this research.  Ministers have said that no fracking would take place until this research is over and there is no guarantee that fracking will ever take place.<\/p><p> With regard to the process, the EPA's corporate governance is scrupulous in how it procures and how it delivers a process to determine the outcome of tenders or calls for research.  This is a sensitive area of research.  There was an open call for research and the agency did not preclude anyone from applying to do it.  It was a worldwide call and we only got six tenders in but this would not be uncommon for large pieces of research.<\/p><p> The evaluation panel includes 27 existing and retired personnel from organisations such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Commission for Energy Regulation, the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency, ETH Zurich, Geological Survey of Ireland, the Health Service Executive, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, University College Cork, University of Bergen in Norway and Ulster University.  The EPA relies on an esteemed technical group of people to inform it that the tender process for the evaluation committee is coming up with the right decision.  They came up with CDM but it is not CDM on its own, it is with the British Geological Survey, Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran, Ulster University and other universities.  It is not a research study that can be dominated by one individual or group.  It must go through the consortium which includes the British Geological Survey, a reputable firm of solicitors, Philip Lee, and other universities, all of whom have reputations to uphold.  The outputs of that research must go through the evaluation committee of 27 members with all of the criteria.  That is why I have absolute confidence that the outputs of the research will meet the EPA's own standard in terms of quality and peer review and that it will be second to none.  It will be as good as any research the agency has commissioned in the past 15 years.  The EPA's research budget peaked at approximately &euro;15 million per year but is now down to around &euro;5 million to &euro;6 million per year.  The agency has very good practices, processes and corporate governance in place to ensure there is no bias within the system and the research can stand up to any research conducted by any other funder in Ireland or Europe.<\/p><p> When it comes to the evaluation of outputs, the 27 existing and retired personnel on the panel from all those organisations have to agree.  I have confidence in those personnel to deliver the type of research required.  I agree there are documented impacts associated with fracking.  We know that because the EPA commissioned a worldwide literature review in advance of this current research programme.  The review found there is potential for groundwater contamination from methane migration, impacts from chemical additives in the fracking fluid, treatment and disposal of flowback fluid, greenhouse gas emissions and water usage.  The EPA's own research tells us that these are issues which must be dealt in any involvement the EPA might have in an application.  The agency is legally obliged to accept applications and we have a quasi-judicial role in evaluating applications.  Therefore, the evidence and science by which we make the assessment of the application must be second to none and stand on its own two feet.  The assessment must be able to withstand judicial review and as part of this work, the agency is trying to get the information that will allow us to make a rigorous assessment of any application that may come to us in the future.  The information will be equally available to the public, to other regulators both North and South and to industries, if they wish to use it, as is all the agency's environmental data.  The EPA is trying to move forward on an open data front that provides all its datasets free of charge on an EPA website and it is working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to try to provide open data in a format that is of use to anyone anywhere in the world, and it will continue to do this.<\/p><p> Climate change is a huge topic.  We have more fossil fuels under the ground than the world can take right now.  Whether these fuels are extracted is a matter for international policy, European policy and Irish policy.  These decisions will be made by the Oireachtas and the Government.  It is purely within the remit of legislators and the Government to take a high level decision that fracking must not take pace in Ireland.  Using this research, the EPA is trying to prepare the basic information that would allow the agency to fulfil a statutory role which it may be called on to fulfil in terms of basic groundwater data.  This is not the only area EPA researches.  It researches other controversial issues, such as genetically modified organisms and nano-particles and materials.  Research is about getting data and information for everyone and putting it out there, it is not about arguing a particular point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120200002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dara Lynott","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449048600,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Will climate change stay the same or will it increase if we frack?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120200002#M00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449048600,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Absolutely.  If more fossil fuels are dug from the ground and burned, whether from the sea or land, it will create greenhouse gases.  That is a fact.  The EPA has a significant role in preparing the inventories for Ireland to determine whether Ireland complies with the Kyoto Protocol, which has gone, and the new targets for 2020 and 2030.  The EPA knows it is still very challenging for Ireland to meet the renewable energy targets, particularly as Ireland's development is dominated by transport and agriculture.  To add significantly more fossil fuels into that mix will make it very difficult for Ireland to meet 2030 targets or 2050 targets.  This is why the renewable energy targets and the reduction of greenhouse gases by 85% to 90% by 2050 is a challenge for Ireland.  There is a huge policy issue to be decided in terms of where Ireland gets its fuel in the future and where hydraulic fracturing, offshore gas and oil or imported gas and oil sit within that challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120200002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dara Lynott"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449048600,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Tasks four and five in Project B look at a comparison in life cycle assessment of communal impact compared to other energy sources in other jurisdictions.

What level of engagement does it have with its EU counterparts or the US authorities on this?  I look at this very coldly from an outsider's point of view.  In the US, it is open season on fracking at the moment, which would not inspire confidence in a person who has legitimate concerns.  What level of engagement, if any, has the EPA had with the US EPA?<\/p> <p>  My understanding is that fracking is basically the injection of air and water under high pressure into the ground, which bursts the rock open and releases gas.  The geological survey map of Ireland reveals that many of the areas that would be regarded as potential fracking areas - the limestone areas of east Clare, Galway, Leitrim, Sligo, Donegal, west Cavan and across the Border - are also areas susceptible to high levels of radon, if one looks at it very coldly and without looking at it without major levels of research.  Would it be fair to say that if rock is burst open to release methane, other gaseous elements could also be potentially released?  Nature has designed that they be released over tens of thousands of years.  However, injecting water and air under high pressure to burst the rock open could release gases other than methane or other organic hydrocarbons.<\/p><p>It could release carcinogenic elements such as radon.  Has that been examined? <\/p><p> I know the study is at an early stage but if water is injected under high pressure and elevated temperatures it will cause the precipitation of a salt, maybe sodium chloride or sodium with other halogens attached and it will wind up in the aquifer.  How is it taken out of the water?  A person who bores a hole on a half acre for water might have to go down several hundred metres before hitting a good quality source of water but will have no idea of the geology gone through to get to that level.

The Office of Radiological Protection, ORP, is on the steering group and one of the scientists will make that evaluation.<\/p> <p>  Ground water is very difficult.  In our research, which predated this research, we indicated that in terms of how any of this activity could be licensed and still meet the very rigid requirements of the ground water directive, it is nearly prohibited.  We are not trying to decide whether it can be done but we definitely will have a fuller understanding of the problems that have to be overcome or maybe cannot be overcome in the way of introducing anything into ground water.  We hope this research will add more information.  The Deputy is right that it will be very difficult to do this on a stand-back basis. <\/p> <p>  In respect of international groups the EPA, representing Ireland, participates in an EU technical working group on environmental aspects of unconventional fossil fuels.  The working group consists of member states, the European Environment Agency, the EU Commission and the purpose of that group is to assist in identifying and addressing knowledge gaps, act as a platform for information exchange so we will definitely bring this research into that group to share what we have seen, and to contribute to the Commission&rsquo;s efforts to assess where the existing EU environmental legislation ensures an appropriate level of protection.  It is moving closer to the view that its current laws are all right in terms of the ground water, water framework and air quality directives.  We are very tuned in to what is happening internationally.  Our inspectors are involved with the EU Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environmental Law, IMPEL.  Senior management of the EPA is involved with a multiple agency network that involves Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland.

This would not be the first time that the EPA has researched into topical areas.  We have seen that with genetic modification, nanomaterials and nanoparticles.  The EPA's sole role is the protection of the environment and health.  We have no other role except that.  The only reason we are doing research is to fulfil that role.  As an independent agency, we do not get funding from oil companies or whatever.

I question the wisdom of carrying out this study.  I have figures from Minister of State Deputy Joe McHugh implying the total cost is &euro;1.75 million, which includes &euro;500,000 from his own Department.  This is excessive and it is wastage in view of the country's austerity programme.  The money could be put to much better use to address problems such as hospital waiting lists, particularly given the controversial nature of the fracking industry and the questions associated with it.  Has Mr. Lynott communicated with Britain, which has topography and geology very similar to ours?<\/p> <p>  This is a sham exercise, or a bit of a charade, and we have much more important things to be doing.  We should have a moratorium on fracking in this country for at least 20 years, during which period we could learn the experience abroad.  Ours is but a little island and fracking could have a considerably detrimental effect on us.<\/p> <p>  It was interesting that Mr. Lynott stated there is nothing in the study regarding the effects on health.  I find that hard to justify.  In the state of New York, the health department carried out a review in December 2014.  In our study, there is an onus on the chief medical officer in the HSE and the Department of Health to become engaged.  Health is a priority in addition to protecting the environment.<\/p> <p>  There is a clear conflict of interest for parties involved in this.  The independence of the study must be queried.<\/p><p>The progress report, presented in September, shows that the bulk of the study is being carried out by CDM Smith and Amec Foster Wheeler, both of which are heavily involved in the oil and gas industry.  Amec is reviewing regulations, legislation and the writing-up of best practice for fracking.  Its client list also includes BP, Shell and ExxonMobil.  We are told the research is undergoing internal and external independent review.  The internal review is being carried out by the members of the consortium.  For example, a task carried out by Amec is reviewed by CDM Smith and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  This clearly is inadequate.  The independent external review is being carried out by members of the steering committee. This, again, is inadequate and extremely poor practice.<br\/><br\/>I cannot fathom how this extensive research was commissioned in the first place.  I will make a comparison with the process of acquiring planning permission for a domestic dwelling.  Particularly in the past ten years, groundwater testing for percolation in sewage treatment systems has become very detailed.  The EPA guidelines are barring a lot of people from setting up a family home in their own areas.  I know of numerous people in my county of Kerry who have, more or less, been barred from building a house owing to extensive regulation.  The EPA is adopting a very loose procedure in respect of fracking and appears to support that industry.  At the same time, there are guidelines for groundwater testing in the case of a domestic house and people are being prohibited from building even on their own land.  I find it hard to comprehend.<br\/><br\/>I advise the EPA to go back and become involved in the health aspect also.  We are on a bit of a wild goose chase.  I ask the EPA to come out with a very strong statement to the Minister.  All it has to do is look across at the United Kingdom and the reports from there.  The EPA has also carried out some preliminary investigations which should have found enough evidence to conclude that this not the way to go in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120200002#Y02200","speaker":"1050","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449048600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I have to refute the suggestion that the EPA is pro-fracking.  It is not in any way, shape or form.  Like any statutory authority, it has a quasi-judicial function and it cannot carry out its quasi-judicial obligations with a biased view.  As the primary environmental regulator and funder of research, it is appropriate that it should look to develop the science on topical and controversial issues, not only things that happened in the past but also future issues.  Given that anyone who wants to engage in fracking has a legal right to seek planning permission, permits or licences from various regulatory authorities, it is also appropriate that the EPA should seek to provide the science to back up any future policy or decisions by these regulators.

This is a controversial issue and the first I heard of it was from media outlets which referred to the mid-west region.  When I poked around a little more, I found out that it was to be undertaken in County Leitrim and west Cavan in my part of the world.  Are there plans for an extension into other parts of the mid-west region?<\/p> <p>  The problems with groundwater and the seepage of chemicals have been covered by other Deputies and Senators.  It is a serious issue as there is a huge number of deep wells across the region.  People depend on such wells for their supply of drinking water, as well as water for animals and domestic use, etc.  This development would have a huge effect.  I have seen seepage from silage pits destroy deep wells perhaps half or three quarters of a mile away.  One well had to be closed for ten or 12 years.  It had to be pumped out and various chemicals used to get it right again but only for slop water.  It was never used to supply drinking water again.<\/p> <p>  Fracking, or gas exploration, involves the bursting of rock.  When we start to interfere with the bowels of the earth, we do not know what damage we will cause, even several miles away.  I have a genuine interest in this issue, as do people to whom I talk.  It is important that we avoid the cultural and landscape rape of rural areas, given that there is a tourism product being developed in the mid-west and across the midlands.  We do not want to see industrial waste sites being developed.<\/p> <p>  As was said, there are so many restrictions on people who wish to build their homes, including once-off housing, in the west.

When Mr. Lynott was replying to Deputy Michael Colreavy, he spoke about the involvement in the planning process of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the EPA, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, etc., but he did not mention a role for the local authority.

I think I have answered most of those questions.  There were two or three questions on Achilles Procurement.<\/p> <p>  Local authorities develop regional and local planning guidelines.  Within those guidelines, they obviously have a role because anyone seeking planning permission must abide by regional and national planning guidance.

However, the research the Deputy has sought would be a logical extension, building on the research that this project would provide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120200002#AA01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dara Lynott"},{"type":"speech","time":1449048600,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Could I ask one supplementary question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120200002#AA02000","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1449048600,"counter":370,"content":"<p>We are into injury time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120200002#AA02100","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1449048600,"counter":371,"content":"<p>It will mean I do not have to send in the list of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120200002#AA02200","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1449048600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120200002#AA02300","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1449048600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their answers  I certainly know two things now that I did not know before.  First, the EPA is driving this project; I did not know who was driving the train.  Second, the EPA study does not incorporate a health impact assessment.  I was unclear about that as well.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions.  The field trials or tests are to be carried out next year.  Could the results of those be used by energy companies to get a firm fix on whether gas exists there, the levels of extraction, or the volume of gas there?<\/p> <p>  In hindsight, does Mr. Lynott think it would have been wiser not to seek expressions of interest until the project the EPA is working on now had been concluded and studied?  Would the seeking and receipt of expressions of interest not raise the expectations of energy companies that there was going to be a result to the work they are doing?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120200002#AA02400","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1449048600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>That is a straight question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120200002#AA02500","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449048600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>The answer to the first question is \"No\".  This study will not determine how much gas is there, where it is, or its viability whatsoever.  Any of the drilling is solely to do with the depth, quality, direction and flow of the water.  In terms of seismology, it will determine how stable or unstable the rock is there.  Therefore, this will not provide any information to any potential extractor of gas about the viability or otherwise of the gas there.<\/p> <p>  In answer to the Deputy's second question, we believe the primary way to get an Irish-specific answer to the science that is needed here as part of this research project is to put in wells and test results.  The issue is broader than this because if the manner of fracking never happens and is never taken on board in Ireland, we will have groundwater wells that will form part of a larger picture of what Irish groundwater quality is.<\/p> <p>  Irish groundwater is in pretty good condition.  About 70% of our waters are in pretty good condition, so that makes the barrier much harder for anyone to come in with activities that seek to introduce contaminants into groundwater or surface water.  Groundwater wells are part of that.<\/p> <p>  Earlier I mentioned Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran but I meant to say Philip Lee Solicitors.  That was a mistake on my part.
