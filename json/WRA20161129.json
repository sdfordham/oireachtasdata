The Post Office Network Implementation Group has been examining issues such as the number and spatial distribution of Post Offices, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts, and training and qualifications for post office employees.  The Implementation Group is nearing the conclusion of its work and its recommendations will be issued to the Board and management of An Post in the next few weeks.  It will be a matter for An Post, as a commercial State company, to consider these recommendations and to bring their proposals to the appropriate Government Ministers for discussion. <\/p>  <p>  Separately, I established the Post Office Hub Working Group to identify potential models under which the post offices could act as community hubs, especially in rural areas.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.<\/p>  <p>  The target of 4,000 civilians  will effectively double the number of civilians undertaking administrative and technical duties within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at present and represents a medium term target of 20% civilians by 2021.  This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently with 14% civilians, more into line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff.  The Garda Inspectorate, in its 2015 report  \"Changing Policing in Ireland\", has estimated that there may be up to 1,500 Garda&iacute; currently in such posts and the Government&rsquo;s plan aims to return as many of these Garda&iacute; as possible to front-line duties over the next five years.  With this in mind, the Garda Commissioner, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, has been requested to identify posts suitable for redeployment by the end of the year and to prepare a 5 year plan for reaching the 20% medium term target.<\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of up to 500 civilians provided for in Budget 2017 will facilitate the Garda Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional level.  These appointments will make an important contribution to the delivery of the ambitious reform agenda set out in the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 and will facilitate deeper civilianisation in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, and again flowing from the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate, the Commissioner has commenced the roll-out on a pilot basis of a Divisional model of policing to replace the current District model.  The benefit of the Divisional model is that responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis which will facilitate greater flexibility in the deployment of resources in response to policing needs.  It also will have the benefit of reducing duplicate administrative tasks currently done at both the District and Divisional level.  In this regard the Commissioner has estimated that 10 Garda&iacute; will be freed up for front-line duties in each Division once the model is fully rolled out.  The roll-out will be done on a phased basis and in such a manner as to ensure that the close relationship between Garda&iacute; and local communities is maintained.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to be aware  that under section 19 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 as amended, the appointment of civilian staff of grades equivalent to, or above, that of chief superintendent are made by the Policing Authority while the appointment of civilian staff equivalent to, or below, that of superintendent are made by the Garda Commissioner.  Arranging for the recruitment of civilian staff is a matter for the Commissioner in accordance with section 26 of the 2005 Act as amended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900062#WRF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900062#WRF01400"},{"type":"question","counter":221,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[37226\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900062#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the funding that has been provided to County Louth over the previous three years 2014 to 2016 by project name, location and funding amount, in tabular form;

It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division. <\/p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

It is carried out by the Garda National Vetting Bureau in accordance with, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 which sets out the arrangements to provide vetting by the Bureau under the charge of a Chief Bureau Officer and operating a National Vetting Bureau database system.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that at present, 80 percent of vetting applications are processed by the Garda National Vetting Bureau in under five working days.  This represents a dramatic improvement in turnaround times for the processing of vetting applications in recent years, falling from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013.  This improvement has come about as a result of an unprecedented investment by the Government and the Garda Authorities in providing this service, including an increase of over 80 percent in staffing levels and the roll out earlier this year of an e-Vetting system.<\/p><p>In April this year I commenced the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 and in tandem with that, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched the e-Vetting system.  E-Vetting facilitates the on-line processing of applications and this has significantly streamlined the vetting process and contributed to a sustained reduction in processing times for vetting applications.  I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that the vast majority of vetting applications, over 85 percent of applications, now received by the Vetting Bureau are received and processed via the e-Vetting system.<\/p><p>One very important feature of the e-Vetting system is that the individual applicant can track the progress of their own vetting application on-line and can, therefore, see when their application has been processed and returned to the relevant registered organisation.<\/p><p>There are a small number of registered organisations who are not yet operating the e-Vetting system and continue to use the old paper format for applications.  For vetting applications that continue to be submitted in paper format, the average turnaround time is in the order of four weeks from the receipt of the application by the Vetting Bureau and this represents a minimum time frame given the administrative input required.  The Garda Authorities continue to work with the organisations who are not yet operating the e-Vetting system to encourage and support them to do so.<\/p><p>Processing times for any given application can be longer in individual cases when, for example, additional enquiries may be necessary or where errors have been made in the application.  It is important to note that delays can also occur in other aspects of the application process which are outside of the control of the Garda Authorities, for example, in the submission or return of applications by the registered organisations.<\/p><p>The primary purpose of the vetting service is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account the importance of protecting children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, the current processing period is not unreasonable.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900063#WRG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":258,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900063#WRG01200"},{"type":"question","counter":259,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[37457\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900063#WRG01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of new garda&iacute; that have been or will be allocated to the Sligo- Leitrim Garda division from the new class; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":260,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

The Sligo Leitrim Division is supported by 24 members of the Garda Reserve and 25 Civilian Staff.

To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p>  <p>   I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 307 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Kildare Division.  The Kildare Division is supported by 22 members of the Garda Reserve and 29 Civilian Staff.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organise Crime Bureau.<\/p>  <p>   While there are currently no Garda&iacute; specifically assigned to the role of Community Garda attached to the Kildare Division, the Commissioner has advised that it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.<\/p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response.  I am also informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties and that 35 of these probationer Garda have been assigned the Kildare Division.  It is expected that Community Policing and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream. <\/p>  <p>  In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is also a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.  The importance of appropriate support and supervision was highlighted in the O&rsquo;Higgins Report.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900064#WRH01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Disciplinary Proceedings","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900064#WRH01900"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[37674\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900064#WRH02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps she has taken to deal with the urgent need to update Garda disciplinary regulations which presently date back to 2007.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>The disciplinary process in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is governed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Discipline) Regulations 2007 as amended in 2011 and 2015.<\/p><p>A number of amendments to the Regulations are in train in order to facilitate the commencement of the provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 in relation of the removal of senior officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Regulations are under the remit of the Minister for Social Protection and prescribe the conditions for transfers to arrangements established outside the State.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue that many transfers of pension benefits overseas are made for legitimate reasons and are fully compliant with the transfer Regulations and Revenue requirements.  The issue of seeking to recoup the tax relief provided to such individuals in building up their pension benefits here does not, therefore, arise. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2012, all overseas pension transfer requests must be accompanied by a declaration signed by the individual concerned to the effect that the transfer is for bona fide reasons and conforms to all of the relevant transfer obligations.

I also mentioned in that reply that seeking to move pension funds or PRSAs overseas in an effort to circumvent the requirements of Irish tax legislation may fall foul of the conditions under which they were approved by Revenue and that this could result in the withdrawal of approval, the effect of which would be the claw back of the tax relief previously given.

This independence is seen as critical to maintaining the integrity of the taxation system and forms a key pillar of Revenue's Governance framework, and it would therefore be neither appropriate nor possible for a Minister for Finance to instruct the Revenue Commissioners to review their policy with regard to the administration of tax legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that\u00a0patronage shares were received by suppliers of milk as a consequence of and in proportion to the quantity of milk supplied.  Where the number of shares is based on and dependent on the level of business between the members and the cooperative or nominated purchaser and where the cooperative does not receive the market price for the shares issued, then the profit accruing i.e. the difference between the market value of the shares issued and the price paid for these shares, to the member is a trading receipt of the member's farming income.  This is no different to the general tax treatment that applies to other forms of share based remuneration.  Employees are liable to income tax on\u00a0share awards for similar reasons the share award is linked to their work and as a consequence the value of any shares awarded is treated as taxable employment income.<\/p>  <p>  Capital Gains Tax (CGT) applies to the growth in the value of a capital asset.  For example, if an individual sells a share that grew in value after it was acquired, CGT would apply, subject to the availability of any exemption, on the increase in value between it being acquired and being sold.  The matter at issue in the particular case, however, is the initial value of the shares received by farmers as a result of their trading relationship with the co-op.  The shares were a form of payment received for the milk supplied by the farmers and therefore the value of the shares forms part of the trading income for the relevant years.<\/p>  <p>  I am assured by Revenue that there has been no change in policy with regard to the imposition of income tax or CGT to share awards and they have emphasised that the matter at issue in this instance is the original market value of the shares received by farmers as a result of their trading relationship with the co-op.<\/p>  <p>  I am further informed by Revenue that the letters which issued to certain farmers were\u00a0invitations to engage with\u00a0Revenue as regards their tax position for the years 2011 to 2013.  The letters in question are in the first instance enquiries with the farmers concerned as to whether the value of the shares received has been included in the accounts for the years in question.  Farmers who did include the\u00a0share value in their accounts\u00a0will not have any additional income tax liability in relation to the specific matter raised in these inquiries.<\/p>  <p>  Early engagement with Revenue, where the share value received has been included in the accounts for the years in question, will mean an early conclusion of Revenue's enquiries.  Early engagement with Revenue,\u00a0where the share value received was not included in the accounts for the years in question, will facilitate a discussion between the individuals concerned and Revenue with a view to agreeing a mutually satisfactory arrangement, including if necessary, a phased payment arrangement, to deal with any tax liability involved.  I am advised by Revenue that there have been extensive contacts with them in regard to this matter generally and they are and will be responding very quickly to those contacts in order to assist farmers to bring matters to an early conclusion.<\/p>  <p>  I would ask the Deputies to encourage any farmers who have received a letter from Revenue in this matter to engage with\u00a0Revenue without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900065#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Data","counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900065#WRJ02250"},{"type":"question","counter":363,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[37344\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900065#WRJ02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the retail credit firms that currently own residential mortgages as per the residential mortgage arrears and repossessions statistics Q2 2016.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":364,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[37345\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900065#WRJ02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the unregulated loan owners that currently own residential mortgages as per the residential mortgage arrears and repossessions statistics Q2 2016.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":365,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 159 together.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Central Bank that information collected by it relating to unregulated loan owners and retail credit firms,\u00a0published in the Central Bank's quarterly statistics on mortgage arrears and repossessions, is subject to a strict confidentiality agreement with the providers of the data.

The Central Bank sought to conduct a broad\u00a0examination of tracker mortgage-related issues covering, among other things, transparency of communications with and contractual rights of tracker mortgage borrowers.<\/p><p>This review is now underway, and the Central Bank is working with the banks to conduct a comprehensive examination of customer mortgage accounts with regard to tracker rates, including any instances where banks may have failed to deliver on their obligations to customers.  Such instances may include\u00a0cases where the bank was not sufficiently clear with customers on their terms and conditions, or where they have failed to honour contractual commitments.<\/p><p>The Central Bank\u00a0has laid out a detailed and rigorous process for each institution to follow.  The identification of affected customers, implementation of\u00a0any appropriate rectification actions, as well as the calculation of any appropriate interest redress or compensation, are all processes currently being worked through by the banks.  The review also involves\u00a0oversight of each bank's work by an independent third party, and the establishment of an independent appeals process.  Further, the Central Bank continues to review and monitor each institution's progress at every stage.  It is possible that different banks will progress through the review process at different speeds.<\/p><p>I expect that the Central Bank, and each of the institutions involved, will provide information periodically on steps taken and progress made.  The tracker mortgage review is an ongoing\u00a0process involving the banks, their regulator and any affected customers; I have no direct role in its implementation.  It is therefore not possible, nor appropriate, for me to speculate at this time\u00a0on the number of customers that may be affected.<\/p><p>For completeness, I have requested a brief update from each of the banks in which the State is a shareholder:<\/p><p><b>AIB<\/b><\/p><p>&quot;AIB is conducting a comprehensive review of customer mortgage accounts with regard to tracker rates.  This process is ongoing. AIB s review has found the bank fell short on its obligations to some customers.  In order to prevent further detriment for the customers identified to date, AIB has in the first instance begun correcting interest rates on these accounts and writing to customers to outline their new interest rates and repayment amounts.  As the review progresses, AIB is commencing refunds to customers who overpaid interest and is paying compensation. Details of a set payment towards the cost of independent professional advice will also be made available to customers and the bank will establish an independent appeals process.  An independent third party, KPMG, is reviewing key aspects of AIB s work.  These steps are in line with the principles outlined by the Central Bank.  The overall review will take some time to complete and other customers may be identified through this ongoing process.  AIB has put in place a customer Freephone Helpline, 1800 235 460 (Mon-Fri, 8:00am-7:00pm), to assist with any queries its customers may have.&quot;<\/p><p><b>PTSB<\/b><\/p><p>&quot;As part of its response to the Central Bank initiated review of Tracker Mortgages in all Irish banks, Permanent TSB is reviewing all Tracker Mortgages issued by the bank.This review is comprehensive and complex and we are not currently in a position to state with certainty when the matter will conclude.<\/p><p>Separately in July 2015 Permanent TSB concluded an investigation into certain specific identified issues in respect of Tracker Mortgages.

Following this report, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) appointed Promontory Financial Group to further investigate these allegations.  Promontory's work along with the involvement of the FCA, led RBS to recently announce redress for certain SME customers of RBS's Global Restructuring Group.\u00a0 The final details of the redress scheme\u00a0remain to be agreed with the\u00a0FCA.<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously answered, Ulster Bank Ireland Limited undertook an independent review into the relevance of these allegations to its corresponding division, namely the Global Restructuring Group Ireland (GRGI).

These mortgage lending control measures apply to any Central Bank regulated financial provider which provides a mortgage loan which is to be secured on residential property located in the State.  However, those regulations do not place any particular residency or currency requirement on relevant loans which would specifically impact on cross border workers resident in the State.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Deputy may also wish to note that the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, which transposed the Mortgage Credit Directive into Irish law, contains certain consumer protection provisions governing the provision of the foreign currency mortgage loans.  In particular, it provides that, at the time the foreign currency mortgage agreement is concluded, the consumer borrower will have the right to convert the loan into an alternative currency or that other arrangements be in place to limit the exchange rate risk to which the borrower is exposed.  This is a mandatory requirement of the Directive and the transposing\u00a0Regulations provide that a lender shall ensure that at least one of these options will be available where applicable.  It is accepted that this new provision will impose some additional regulatory requirements on an\u00a0Irish bank when\u00a0providing\u00a0foreign currency mortgage loans, but this will also need to be considered against the additional protections which\u00a0will now be\u00a0available to consumer borrowers who enter into such credit contracts.  While it is and remains a commercial matter for individual lenders to decide on the type and nature of credit it wishes to offer consumers, either\u00a0in general or in an individual case, I would expect lenders to be in a position to adjust their systems and practices to take on board evolving and legal requirements which have the primary objective of increasing the protections available to consumer mortgage borrowers\u00a0including those in relation to foreign currency mortgage loans\u00a0as provided for in the Mortgage Credit Directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900066#WRK01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":384,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900066#WRK01150"},{"type":"question","counter":385,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[37889\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900066#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the appointment of additional special advisers by him and Ministers of State in his Department.","asker":"1330","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":386,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that I have not appointed additional Special Advisors.

The manner in which any school ensures that the right to opt out of religion classes is upheld is a matter for the school concerned. <\/p>  <p>  Each individual school must determine the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances having regard to local issues such as available space, supervision requirements and how the school concerned organises classes etc. <\/p>  <p>  The Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the primary school sector (2012) recommended steps that could be taken to ensure that the education system can provide a sufficiently diverse number and range of primary schools to cater for children of all religions and none. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to increase the number of multi-denominational schools to 400 by 2030.  However, existing schools will continue to be expected to cater for the full range of traditions, religions and beliefs in the community. <\/p>  <p>  A public consultation on inclusiveness in primary schools was carried out in 2013. Views were sought on issues such as how best to accommodate students of various belief systems and traditions and having school policies on the conduct of religious celebrations and the display of religious symbols. \u00a0A paper, entitled \"Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector: Progress to Date and Future Directions\", which took account of the public consultation, was published in 2014.  The paper outlined good practice and options for promoting diversity in schools in a number of areas, including the right to opt-out of religious classes.<\/p>  <p>  The paper gives an overview of current practice in schools in relation to the right to opt-out of religious classes and states that each school should arrive at solutions that suit its own particular context and to engage in dialogue with parents about the arrangements to be put in place before the child starts school.  Schools are encouraged to develop their own practices and policies in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently, the Catholic Schools Partnership (2015) developed a resource for Catholic schools entitled &lsquo;Catholic Primary Schools in a Changing Ireland: Sharing Good Practice on Inclusion of All Pupils&rsquo;.  It gives suggestions on developing polices and sharing best practice with regard to inclusion of all pupils, which gives practical suggestions to schools in how to engage positively in inter-cultural dialogue.<\/p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, which passed second stage on the 17th November 2016, also includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school's arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction. <\/p>  <p>  I believe this is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has also been working on draft legislation to provide for replacing the current Section 28 of the Education Act, 1998.

These schools were unable to participate for a number of reasons, such as\u00a0due to the\u00a0time required to\u00a0be involved in the project, or involvement in a range of\u00a0other projects or pilots.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The pilot of this new model was therefore conducted in 47 schools over the course of the 2015\/16 school year. 28 at Primary School and 19 at Post Primary School. <\/p>  <p>  A review of this pilot has been completed and a report of the review is currently being finalised. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the review will indicate that the new model has been positively received by schools and parents. <\/p>  <p>  Schools indicated that they welcomed the increased flexibility and autonomy provided by the model to allocate resources based on need.  Most schools believe the model allows more scope for team teaching, targeted interventions, mix of in-class and group work, with less focus on withdrawal and one to one teaching.  Schools welcome the move away from the unnecessary labelling of children in order to secure resources.  Schools also welcomed that they no longer need to wait for diagnosis and that this facilitates intervention at an earlier stage based on the schools identification of need.  In addition schools indicated a belief that they were broadly well supported in meeting the needs of children with Special Educational Needs.<\/p>  <p>  As part the recent Budget announcements, I announced that following development and piloting over the past number of years, a new model for the allocation of teaching resources for children with special educational needs will be implemented from September 2017.<\/p>  <p>  An additional &euro;18 million will be provided in 2017 to provide for around 900 resource teacher posts.<\/p>  <p>  Further details regarding implementation of the new model will be announced in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900069#WRN00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":504,"content":"<p>Question No. 208 answered with Question No. 188.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":505,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900069#WRN00450"},{"type":"question","counter":506,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[37323\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900069#WRN00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department has put in place a plan to address the issues facing the education sector by the proposed exit of Britain from the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":507,"content":"<p>The Government has a contingency framework in place which maps the key issues that will be most important to Ireland in the coming weeks and months.

Contingency planning and stakeholder consultations are being led and managed by the EU\/International unit of the Department.  This Unit reports regularly to the Management Board, the Secretary General and myself on Brexit planning.  Their role included participation in cross-Departmental planning and co-ordination Groups.<\/p>  <p>  Following the British Prime Minister&rsquo;s announcement of the intention to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by March 2017 the Government on 4th October 2016 detailed further actions to ensure continuing effective management of, and engagement on, Brexit issues.  Six working groups were established to deepen the analysis already undertaken by Departments of the sectoral implications of Brexit.  Their purpose is to advise Government on the sectoral and thematic contexts and priority recommended Government actions both in terms of negotiation process and policy measures. <\/p>  <p>  Among\u00a0these, the Economy and Trade Workgroup has five sub-groups concerned with specific sectoral issues including education.  Chaired by my Department and representative of a number of agencies and other Departments, the Education subgroup met on 28 October 2016 to consider key issues and priorities for the Irish education sector in the context of the future discussions and negotiations should the UK Government proceed as announced to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty in early 2017.  Further meetings of the Education Subgroup will be held in the coming weeks and will reflect on the outcomes of the stakeholder engagement process that is under way.<\/p>  <p>  In seeking to respond to these issues dialogue and consultation with stakeholders and interested parties form an integral part of our Brexit planning.  In that regard I\u00a0opened a Brexit information event for the education sector on 14 November 2016 in Dublin.  At this event I\u00a0set out the latest Government position and actions to prepare for Brexit, and outlined the format of further consultations to take place to confirm our priorities in preparation for the negotiation phase in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  To that end\u00a0I have asked my Department to convene consultative fora for the schools sector, the further education and training sector and the higher education sector in December 2016 and January 2017.

This gives effect to the Government decision of 2011 which revised the employment and pension arrangements for teachers who became Oireachtas members so that any member of the Oireachtas who holds a teaching post in a primary, secondary, community, comprehensive or vocational school would have the option of applying for a career break of up to 10 years.  This replaced then existing leave arrangements.  The decision also applied to lecturing staff of Institutes of Technology.  The December 2015 Government decision extended these career break\/unpaid leave provisions to all staff in the education and training sector.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the 2011 Government decision, teachers who were elected to the Oireachtas could enjoy beneficial leave arrangements.  Under these arrangements, a teacher who was elected as a T.D. or Senator was paid full salary.  A temporary replacement teacher was employed and the Oireachtas member teacher repaid the salary of that replacement teacher to the Department\/ their employer, together with the appropriate superannuation and employer&rsquo;s PRSI contributions.  The Oireachtas member teacher retained any surplus amount.  The Oireachtas member teacher continued to accrue incremental credit in their teaching post.  In addition to this, Oireachtas member teachers in primary, voluntary secondary and Community and Comprehensive schools continued to accumulate pensionable service in both their teaching post and as a member of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  The 2011 Government decision is communicated to school management and teachers in Chapter 4 of the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions of Employment for Registered Teachers in Recognised Primary and Post Primary Schools - Career Break Scheme where it states: &ldquo;The main objectives of this scheme below, which are not exhaustive, is for employers, wherever possible to facilitate applicants in the areas of: &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; Public Representation\".<\/p>  <p>  To permit Oireachtas members to job share in a teaching post whilst still members of the Oireachtas would mean such members receiving two public salaries at the same time.  One as a public representative and one as a teacher with consequent reduced hours for the existing replacement teacher. <\/p>  <p>  The reason public representation is not stated in chapter 5 of the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions of Employment for Registered Teachers in Recognised Primary and Post Primary Schools &ndash; Job Sharing Scheme is because public representation is already covered in Chapter 4 of the book.<\/p>  <p>  The effect of the Government decisions is that the only means by which a person employed in the education and training sector who takes up a seat in the Oireachtas can temporarily take leave from their post and subsequently return to it is through taking a career break\/period of unpaid leave.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that a number of Oireachtas members are employed as teachers or at other grades in the education and training sector.  The career break\/unpaid leave arrangements apply to all such individuals while they are sitting Oireachtas members.  I am sure that you, along with all members of the Oireachtas, will appreciate the thinking behind the Government decisions in this matter and to allow an Oireachtas member to job share in a teaching post whilst at the same time attend the Oireachtas as a member would not be in keeping with the Government decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900069#WRN02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":542,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900069#WRN02950"},{"type":"question","counter":543,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[37456\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900069#WRN03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a purchase has been completed for a site for a school (details supplied).","asker":"1225","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":544,"content":"<p>Officials from my Department have worked closely with officials from Meath County Council under the Memorandum of Understanding for the acquisition of a school site for the provision of permanent accommodation for the school referred to by the Deputy. <\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that agreement in principle has been reached with a landowner in respect of a site to accommodate the school.\u00a0 The next\u00a0stage in the\u00a0acquisition process is the completion of the conveyancing\u00a0process.\u00a0Officials in my Department are liaising with representatives of the landowner in order to progress the acquisition through this stage.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The school patron will be informed as soon as the acquisition is complete.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900069#WRN03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":545,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 222 and 223 answered with Question No. 180.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Services Staff","counter":547,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900070#WRO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":548,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[37464\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900070#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide for a scheme for schools to employ secretaries separate from capitation payments.","asker":"1225","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":549,"content":"<p>A scheme was\u00a0initiated in 1978 for the employment of Clerical Officers in primary and secondary schools.

Government housing policy is to enable all households to access good quality housing appropriate to their household circumstances and in sustainable communities of their choice.  The main focus of social housing supports is on meeting the most acute housing needs among the population, within the resources available.  Thus, State-funded housing supports will continue to be targeted at those people who are unable to provide for their accommodation from their own resources, as measured by their annual net income.<\/p>  <p>  The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for eligibility for social housing supports in each housing authority, in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of income needed to provide for a household's basic needs plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.   <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current income limits generally provide for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources.  However, these limits will continue to be kept under review by my Department, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda set out in the Social Housing Strategy 2020-Support, Supply and Reform and Rebuilding Ireland-Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. <\/p>  <p>  Action 4.6 of Rebuilding Ireland provides for the introduction of a new pilot affordable rental scheme to enhance the capacity of the private rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  The objective of the scheme is to provide long-term affordable residential accommodation for low to moderate income key-worker households in urban areas of high demand and provide an economic incentive to increase supply of rental accommodation.

Rebuilding Ireland takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market by including actions to streamline the planning system, remove infrastructure blockages and support the delivery of affordable housing.  These measures should help make new developments economically viable in areas where supply constraints and price pressures are particularly acute.<\/p><p>Earlier this month, I announced details of 23 Major Urban Housing Development Sites with the potential to deliver up to 30,000 additional homes on existing zoned lands and close to the key areas of demand over the next 3-4 years.  These sites will be highlighted as exemplars for the co-ordination and delivery of plan-led housing development and active land management. <\/p><p>In order to quickly get key sites moving, a &euro;200 million Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) has been established.  Twenty-one local authorities, working in conjunction with housing providers, submitted proposals for funding which are currently being evaluated.  Successful bid proposals will be announced in December. <\/p><p>Separately, the National Treasury Management Agency and Ireland Strategic Investment Fund are currently exploring opportunities to support the delivery of housing-related on-site enabling infrastructure in large-scale priority development areas with a view to kick starting the development process.<\/p><p>Given the particular challenge faced by first-time buyers in accessing the housing market, my colleague, the Minister for Finance recently announced a Help-to-Buy initiative as part of Budget 2017.  The Help-to-Buy initiative has been designed to complement the structural measures announced in Rebuilding Ireland, by providing immediate and targeted support for first-time buyers of new homes in meeting their deposit requirements, greater certainty regarding the pool of available purchasers is provided to the housebuilding sector, encouraging the construction of new housing units.<\/p><p>The combined effect of these and other actions under the Plan will help reduce costs and deliver more housing at affordable prices, where it is most needed.<\/p><p>In addition, there are currently two house purchase loan offerings available to lower income first time buyers from local authorities.<\/p><p>The first is a standard annuity mortgage available from all local authorities.  A first time buyer unable to get a loan from a building society or a bank, may be eligible for a mortgage from the local authority concerned to purchase a new or second hand property or build their own home.\u00a0 The loan can be up to 97% of the price of the house subject to a maximum loan of &euro;200,000.\u00a0 A local authority mortgage is an annuity mortgage with variable interest rates so repayments will go up and down in line with interest rate changes.\u00a0 The relevant terms and conditions applying to local authority housing loans are set out in the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012.  Key eligibility criteria provide that a loan applicant must be a first time buyer and must be able to show their local authority that they cannot get a loan from a bank or building society.  Also, the gross income (before tax) of a single income household in the previous year must be &euro;50,000 or less and the combined gross income (before tax) of a two income household in the previous year must be &euro;75,000 or less.  Prospective applicants should contact their relevant local authority for further information.<\/p><p>The second option is the Home Choice Loan, a Government backed mortgage for first time buyers.\u00a0 The relevant terms and conditions applying to the Home Choice Loan are set out in the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009.  First time buyers can apply for a Home Choice Loan to purchase a new or second hand property or build their own home.  Home Choice Loan provides up to 92% of the market value of a property purchased, subject to a maximum loan amount of &euro;285,000.\u00a0 The loan is a normal capital and interest bearing mortgage which is repaid on a monthly basis.\u00a0\u00a0Home Choice Loan offers one variable interest rate.  The rate is currently set at 3.25% variable, APR 3.30%.\u00a0 Further information is available at . <\/p><p>To support local authorities in operating their housing loan schemes in a consistent and efficient manner, the Housing Agency provides a central underwriting service to local authorities.  The credit underwriting process considers the impact that family circumstances may have on the loan applicant&rsquo;s capacity to make loan repayments.  The final decision on loan approval is a matter for the relevant local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with the relevant statutory Credit Policy that underpins the scheme and aims to ensure prudent lending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900073#WRR03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":703,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900074#WRS00150"},{"type":"question","counter":704,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[37331\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900074#WRS00200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans for any future affordable housing schemes.","asker":"1287","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":705,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s  Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, which is available at the website www.rebuildingireland.ie, sets out a practical and implementable set of actions that aim to increase the supply of homes to 25,000 units per annum by 2020, thereby creating a functioning and sustainable housing system.

A breakdown of the number of households supported by HAP in each local authority area at the end of Quarter 3, 2016 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:.<\/p><p>The flexibility of HAP as a form of social housing support is one of the scheme&rsquo;s key elements and an important benefit envisaged for many households with a housing need.  The movement of households, including movement between local authority areas, for the purposes of employment, further education or other reasonable reasons is facilitated for households under the scheme, while retaining HAP support.  The movement of HAP approved households between neighbouring local authority areas has been facilitated to date in a small number of cases.  However, the phased implementation of the HAP pilot scheme has afforded my Department opportunity for learning and it is in this context that the need for greater ease in the provision of flexibility of movement of HAP households between local authority areas has been identified.  This matter is under consideration and the options to facilitate such movements, while remaining cognisant of the Ministerial direction in relation to transfers to other forms of social housing, are being explored within my Department with input from those local authorities where the scheme is operational.<\/p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  In general, I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900074#WRS00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regeneration Projects Funding","counter":711,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900074#WRS00750"},{"type":"question","counter":712,"qnumday":288,"qnumall":"[37346\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900074#WRS00800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide continued funding to the Ballymun social regeneration fund for 2017 and beyond; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":713,"content":"<p>My Department has recently agreed with Dublin City Council to continue to fund social regeneration community initiatives in Ballymun from the Exchequer at the existing current annual level of &euro;1.7 million in 2017.

The self-assessed charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.

Similar concerns have also been expressed to me by the Association of Irish Local Government. <\/p>  <p>  In this connection, I wish to outline that, under the proposed new procedures, applications for planning permission in respect of large-scale housing developments will only be considered on lands that have already been zoned for residential development in the relevant city or county development plan, as determined by the elected members in the process of the adoption of the development plan.  This remains a reserved function of the elected members and will not change under the new procedures.   <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is intended under the proposed new procedures that local authorities will be centrally involved in the pre-application consultation consideration of proposed large-scale housing developments with the developers in question and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  When a planning application in respect of a large-scale housing development is subsequently submitted to the Board, local authorities will be further required to submit a report - including making recommendations indicating their view on whether proposed development should be granted or refused permission - to the Board as part of the proposed new arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  Taking account of the concerns expressed to date and the respective reserved and executive functions of local elected members and the local authority executive, I have indicated that I am supportive of tabling a Government amendment to the proposed new arrangements so that elected members are informed of any strategic housing developments proposed for their local areas at an early point in the process thereby facilitating them to make submissions on any such proposed developments.  This would enhance the involvement of elected members in the proposed new procedures relating to large scale housing developments, giving them an opportunity to input to the process and to represent the views of their constituents in accordance with their democratic mandate.  I am proposing an amendment to the Bill to this effect at Report Stage in the Seanad later today.   <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to engage with members of both Houses on all provisions of the Bill as it progresses through both Houses so that the measures contained in it are pragmatic and workable, while also ensuring that local authorities and elected members are involved in, and can input to, the proposed new procedures.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900075#WRT01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies Expenditure","counter":749,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900075#WRT01400"},{"type":"question","counter":750,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[37607\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900075#WRT01500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the total grant aid paid to An Taisce by his Department in each year from 2010 to 2016, respectively; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":751,"content":"<p>The table sets out details of funding to An Taisce from my Department over the period in question:<\/p><p><b>Funding to An Taisce<\/b><table><tr><th>2010 <\/th><th>2011 <\/th><th>2012 <\/th><th>2013 <\/th><th>2014 <\/th><th>2015 <\/th><th>2016 <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro; <\/td><td>&euro; <\/td><td>&euro; <\/td><td>&euro; <\/td><td>&euro; <\/td><td>&euro; <\/td><td>&euro;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>0 <\/td><td>0 <\/td><td>0 <\/td><td>0 <\/td><td>275,492 <\/td><td>278,000 <\/td><td>358,758 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>In addition, An Taisce is in receipt of fun ding from the Environment Fund.

There are two types of contractual arrangements which may be entered into between landlords, housing authorities and tenants under the Scheme - one is known as a Tenancy by Tenancy agreement and the other is known as an Availability Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Tenancy by Tenancy arrangement a Residential Tenancy agreement is completed by the landlord, the housing authority and the tenant.  In this specific arrangement, there is no on-going availability agreement between the landlord and the housing authority - the arrangement continues to exist for as long as the existing tenant resides in the property.  However, the tenancy contract between the landlord and the tenant is subject to the provisions and protections of the Residential Tenancies Act and can therefore endure for an unrestricted period.  When the tenant leaves the property the contractual relationship between the landlord and the local authority comes to an end.   <\/p>  <p>  Under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 all tenants who are allocated RAS accommodation after 1 April 2011 are deemed to have their housing need met and will no longer remain on the main social housing waiting list.  However, it is recommended that local authority allocation schemes provide a &ldquo;transfer pathway&rdquo; for RAS tenants, where RAS households can apply to transfer to other forms of social housing support, and many tenants have availed of the transfer option and have moved on to other forms of social housing support.   <\/p>  <p>  Local authorities apply the same differential rent scheme to all of their tenants regardless of whether the property provided is owned by the local authority, or secured for social housing use under other arrangements such as a long term lease or rental accommodation agreements.  When a tenant&rsquo;s income increases due to increased level of employment, including full-time employment, their differential rent will increase in accordance with the local authority&rsquo;s rent scheme.  While differential rent can exceed market rent for high income households under some local authorities&rsquo; rent schemes, an increase in a tenant&rsquo;s income has no direct effect on their tenancy arrangement.  In such a case, it is open to the tenant to leave local authority housing and find alternative housing in the private market; however, this is a matter for the tenant and they are under no onus to do so. <\/p>  <p>  Similarly, when a RAS tenancy ends and the landlord does not wish to renew the tenancy agreement, the household remains a local authority tenant and the onus is on the local authority to find alternative accommodation for them.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900075#WRT01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Cases","counter":755,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900075#WRT02000"},{"type":"question","counter":756,"qnumday":303,"qnumall":"[37627\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900075#WRT02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if his Department, or the agencies that report to his Department, entered into any non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements with any organisation due to court action or a threatened court action; and if so, the persons or groups with which these agreements exist.","asker":"1235","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":757,"content":"<p>The information requested is being compiled insofar as my Department is concerned, and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.

Deputies on all sides of the House are fully aware of the positive benefits derived from schemes like the Rural Social Scheme.  While communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen, participants also have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing valuable work in their local communities.  Community groups have benefitted from the many projects undertaken through the scheme with minimal cost to the Exchequer.  The scheme has also played an important role in sustaining rural communities.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the social welfare budget package for 2017, I announced an increase of &euro;5 a week in the personal rate of payment for rural social scheme (RSS) participants from March 2017.  I also announced an additional 500 places on the scheme to be rolled out in 2017.  This will increase the overall number of places to 3,100.  My Department intends allocating these places as early as possible in 2017, taking into account a number of factors.  These include the number of places already allocated, the demand for places in particular areas, work opportunities available and the numbers of farmers and fishermen and women in receipt of income support.<\/p>  <p>  Eligibility for participation on the scheme will continue to remain limited to those in receipt of certain specified social welfare payments and all participants must be also actively engaged in farming or fishing.  In future, all new entrants to the RSS will have to be over 25 years of age and, in addition, a 6 year overall participation limit will be introduced on the scheme.  This will ensure that there will be a throughput of places available and that younger people will have an opportunity to explore other training or education options before a long term work programme.

The application of a three-day waiting period avoids the disproportionately high administrative costs involved in processing large numbers of claims of a very short duration.  The waiting day rule is not applied in every case.  For instance, a &ldquo;period of interruption of employment&rdquo; exists where a person is unemployed or sick for any three days (consecutive or not) within six days.  Where a person is subject to intermittent spells of unemployment it would clearly be unreasonable to impose the three waiting days for each such claim.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly legislation enables, by means of a \"linking rule\", the aggregation of spells of unemployment so that the waiting period is confined to the first three days of the aggregate period of interruption of employment.  Specifically, this linking rule provides that any two such periods of unemployment not separated by more than 26 weeks are treated as one such period.  Consequently, where a person makes a repeat claim for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit within 26 weeks of their previous claim, the repeat claim links to the earlier claim and no waiting days apply.<\/p>  <p>  I would emphasise that people who need financial support are not left without such support during &lsquo;waiting&rsquo; days.  A person who has no other income may claim supplementary welfare allowance in respect of the days in question.<\/p>  <p>  While schemes and procedures are under continuous review, I have no plans at present to change the waiting days rule in respect of the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900078#WRW01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":879,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900078#WRW01700"},{"type":"question","counter":880,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[37590\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900078#WRW01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will expedite an application for a disability allowance in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":881,"content":"<p>This lady has been awarded disability allowance with effect from 5 October 2016.

This practice is unjust and illegal, and in most cases is intended to push the inhabitants from their homes and land in order to give it to Israeli settlers.  This is wholly contrary to the protection that should be afforded a people under military occupation.  Ireland and the EU have consistently opposed and condemned this practice for many years, but regrettably the tempo of evictions and demolitions has continued to increase markedly.<\/p>  <p>  A growing aspect of this issue is the question of the demolition by Israel of humanitarian relief structures, including tents and water and power structures, funded by the EU or its member States.  The issue of asking for compensation for confiscated or demolished EU assets in Area C of the West Bank is a matter that is currently under discussion at EU level.  Ireland has argued for a stronger response to demolitions and confiscations and, in my view, the EU should request compensation in such instances.  However, not all EU partners are of the same mind.  Agreement on this point has not been reached, but I will continue to advocate for compensation.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the publication of the report by the EU Delegation to the West Bank and Gaza on demolitions and confiscations of EU-funded structures in Area C, the standard assumption is that such reports are not published, and they are prepared on this basis.

The approach to this case is under continuous review and is informed and shaped by, inter alia, constant coordination and dialogue with Ibrahim&rsquo;s family and his legal representatives, by the experience and expertise of officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, by our consultations with other States who have had citizens in similar situations, and by advice from legal and human rights experts with knowledge of Egypt.  <\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that the Taoiseach wrote to the President of Egypt on 17 November to convey again the Irish Government&rsquo;s strong concerns about this case, and to reiterate our call for his return to Ireland without delay.

On the same day, I contacted the Egyptian Ambassadors in Ireland and also discussed this issue and request with her. <\/p>  <p>  Details of this amnesty scheme are opaque.

Of this, &euro;129.4 million was in voluntary contributions and &euro;8.8 million in assessed contribution.  <\/p><p>It is not the Government&rsquo;s policy to donate goods in kind to the UN in lieu of part payment of Ireland&rsquo;s assessed contributions.  However, Ireland does pre-position and stockpile humanitarian relief supplies in UN Humanitarian Response Depots (UNHRD) under the Rapid Response Initiative, which is managed by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  These hubs are strategically located near crisis and disaster-prone areas, in Accra, Brindisi, Dubai, Panama City and Subang, in Malaysia to enable the rapid dispatch of supplies in case of a crisis. <\/p><p>The relief items stockpiled by Ireland in these hubs have been selected in close consultation with UN and NGO partners, which, distribute them in response to a crisis to those most in need to save and protect lives and alleviate suffering.  They include UN standard-approved items which are most urgently needed by people in humanitarian crises or emergency situations.  These include shelter items, such as family tents, tarpaulins, and rope; basic household items such as blankets, mosquito nets, cooking sets, solar lamps and family hygiene kits; and water and sanitation items such as soap, jerry cans, water tanks, latrine plates and spades.  So far in 2016, we have airlifted over 350 tonnes of Ireland&rsquo;s stockpiled relief supplies into humanitarian crises in Ethiopia, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Niger, Nigeria, Iraq, and most recently in response to Hurricane Matthew in Haiti.<\/p><p>As well as storing the items in Depots, the UNHRD procures the relief items through a competitive tendering process which is regulated by the World Food Programme (WFP).  The Government&rsquo;s policy for international development, <i>One World One Future, <\/i>reaffirms our commitment to providing &ldquo;aid that is not conditional on procurement of goods and services from Ireland&rdquo;<i>.<\/i>Ireland&rsquo;s aid to developing countries is untied and our continued long term commitment to untied aid remains firm.

I will be happy to release any reports of these meetings following completion of this process.<\/p>  <p>  In August this year, my Department issued licences under the Wildlife Acts to the Irish Coursing Club, covering its affiliated coursing clubs, to capture and tag hares for use at regulated hare coursing meetings for the 2016\/17 coursing season, which extends from the end of September 2016 to the end of February 2017. <\/p>  <p>  There are 26 conditions in total associated with the licences issued to the Irish Coursing Club.

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.  As Minister, I draw on information provided by the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, maintained by my Department, to recommend structures for inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures.  However, the final decision is a reserved function of the planning authority.   <\/p>  <p>  Under Section 54 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a planning authority may add to or delete from its Record of Protected Structures, a structure, a specified part of a structure or a specified feature of the attendant grounds of a structure.  Such a structure, specified part of a structure, or specified feature remains on the Record of Protected Structures until such time as the planning authority deletes it.  Provision is made in the Act for the carrying out of works to protected structures either by way of planning permission or on the foot of a declaration received from a planning authority that certain works that would not materially affect the character of a structure are exempted development.  There is a duty of owners and occupiers to protect structures from endangerment.  Where structures become endangered or unauthorised development has been or is being carried out, the planning authority has the powers to take appropriate action.<\/p>  <p>  There is a number of ways in which my Department acts in respect of possible heritage sites\/buildings deemed to be at risk.  One of these is the receipt of applications for funding for the repair, conservation, preservation or safeguarding of protected structures, sites or monuments.  Financial support is being provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings, such as the Structures at Risk Fund and the Built Heritage Investment Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by the setting up of a commission to identify buildings at risk.  The management of endangerment is a statutory function already undertaken by planning authorities.  The publication of general lists of structures at risk might, in fact, have the adverse effect of drawing attention to the vulnerability of particular structures, which may be unsecured or inadequately secured and may typically contain valuable historic and artistically important fixtures and features, as well as lead, copper and other metals for which there is an illegal market.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900085#WRDD03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":1170,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900085#WRDD03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1171,"qnumday":460,"qnumall":"[37157\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900085#WRDD03400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her role and procedure in making a preservation order on a historical site and area; and if she will consider the need for legislation allowing her the power to designate a site, area or building as a national monument.","asker":"1291","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1172,"content":"<p>Section 8 of the National Monuments Act 1930 (as amended) provides for the making of a preservation order where it appears to the Minister that a monument which, in her\/his opinion is a national monument, is in danger of being or is actually being destroyed, injured or removed, or is falling into decay due to neglect.

Waterways Ireland engages in promotion, including marketing and development of the tourism and commercial potential of the inland waterways for which it has responsibility.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has no statutory function in relation to the canals.<\/p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland works strategically with Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, sports bodies and associations, and local authorities to actively develop the tourism and economic potential of the inland waterways.  Waterways Ireland is currently working with these and other bodies in developing blueways as a means to attract new visitors to use the waterways and in response to the growth in demand for recreational activities, such as walking, canoeing, cycling and stand-up paddle boarding. <\/p>  <p>  The Canals Act, 1986, (Bye-laws) 1988 provide for the management of canal and canal property and regulate the use of boats on the Royal Canal, the Grand Canal and the Barrow Navigation.

The proposed changes to the Canals Act 1986 would introduce a provision for the regulation of the type or class of boats (including its dimensions) that may be used on the canals.  The provisions would also provide for the regulation of berths and moorings on the canals.  This would include house boats.  The proposed changes would allow Waterways Ireland to make new bye-laws to proactively manage the Royal and Grand Canals, as well as the Barrow Navigation.  Following enactment of the legislation, Waterways Ireland would intend to bring forward proposed new bye-laws for consideration.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Grand Canal Basin area, Waterways Ireland, through the Action Plan for Grand Canal Dock and Spencer Dock, is considering opportunities to increase access to Grand Canal Dock and Spencer Dock to reflect their importance as the gateways to the inland waterways network of Ireland.  One of the actions being considered is opening access into Grand Canal Dock from the Grand Canal Dock DART Station on Barrow Street.  This would leave Grand Canal Dock directly accessible by rail, just one stop from Trinity College, which would significantly increase the Dock's potential to attract both residents and visitors from this central location in the city.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Waterways Ireland will continue to work through a partnership approach with stakeholders, including State bodies, local authorities, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and, most importantly, local communities to create opportunities to increase the use of these valuable public assets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900086#WREE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Post Office Network","counter":1202,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900086#WREE02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1203,"qnumday":472,"qnumall":"[32207\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900086#WREE02700","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her plans to safeguard the position and operation of the post office network and especially rural post offices; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1204,"content":"<p>The postal sector is undergoing significant change both nationally and internationally, with the increased use of electronic communications leading to a decline in core mail volume for An Post.

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.

Provision is made in the Act for the carrying out of works to protected structures either by way of planning permission or on the foot of a declaration received from a planning authority that certain works that would not materially affect the character of a structure are exempted development.

The Company must submit a separate application to extend a treatment to a new cohort of patients.

Independent reviews since 2006 have reaffirmed the importance of co-location with a major adult teaching hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Planning permission was granted for this new children&rsquo;s hospital, as well as for two Paediatric OPD and Urgent Care Satellite Centres at Tallaght and Connolly Hospital, in April of this year, clearing the way for enabling works which began this summer on the campus of St. James's Hospital.  It is expected that the satellite centres at Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital can open in 2018, significantly enhancing access to urgent care and outpatient services for children from the Greater Dublin Area.  Building work on the main site will be completed in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The previous Government committed to making &euro;200m available from the sale of the National Lottery for the new children's hospital, adding to the existing &euro;450m Exchequer funding and underlining the Government's commitment to the project.  The 2014 estimate, as set out in the approved Project Brief, affirmed delivery of the core hospital, including both satellite centres, within this envelope.  As with any capital project, it is essential that cost estimates be reviewed and refined as appropriate, including making prudent provision for construction inflation.<\/p>  <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, which is the statutory body charged with delivery of the capital project, is currently reviewing tenders, received at the end of October, for the main and specialist contractors for the hospital on the campus of St James&rsquo;s and the two satellite centres.  Due to the high profile nature of this project it is a highly competitive tender process and so it is anticipated that this will be reflected in the submissions tendered.  Final capital costs will be available following tender evaluations.  As the tendering process is still ongoing and for reasons of commercial sensitivity, details of cost estimates cannot be provided at this stage.  It is my intention to bring a Memorandum to Government early in 2017 in relation to the new children&rsquo;s hospital and associated satellite centres.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of transitioning the new children's hospital to a site at Connolly Hospital has not been assessed in any detail given the fact that no such project exists.  Additional to the capital cost of developing the children's hospital itself on the campus, a significant upgrade of Connolly Hospital would be required to achieve the same potential for quality of clinical outcomes as co-location\/tri-location with St James&rsquo;s, requiring very substantial investment of human and capital resources to develop over time into an adult tertiary hospital with critical mass supported by leading edge research facilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900092#WRLL01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alcohol Treatment Programmes","counter":1443,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900092#WRLL01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1444,"qnumday":561,"qnumall":"[37319\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900092#WRLL01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 220 of 20 October 2016, if he will ensure a reply is provided to the question raised without further delay.","asker":"1222","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1445,"content":"<p>The provision of services to prevent and treat addiction to alcohol is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.

In Ireland over 580,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and over 220,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the statutory regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review, in which the HPRA participated, focused on two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.  The review found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions.  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the EMA stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information which is now binding in all member states.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services.  The HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.  <\/p>  <p>  I encourage the parents of all eligible girls to ensure that their daughters receive this important cancer preventing vaccine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900094#WRNN00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drug Treatment Programmes Availability","counter":1508,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900094#WRNN00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1509,"qnumday":585,"qnumall":"[37483\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900094#WRNN00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will offer additional funding to the Ais&eacute;ir&iacute; centre in County Wexford and in particular the Aislinn service which is the only residential adolescent detoxification and rehabilitation service here; his views on the importance of this service being vital in tackling addiction for young persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1510,"content":"<p>On 12 October 2016, I announced the allocation of an additional &euro;3m in the 2017 Budget to increase support for interventions aimed at improving the health outcomes of vulnerable groups, in particular  those affected by addiction, through establishing a supervised injecting facility in Dublin City centre and providing more detox places.<\/p>  <p>  The additional funding will be used to address my key priorities in 2017, which include addressing gaps in addiction service provision for under 18s.

My Department is aware that cannabis for medicinal use has been legalised in some countries and that there have been several studies internationally on the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids for a number of medical issues. <\/p>  <p>  I understand the concern of these and many other people who believe that cannabis should be a treatment option for certain medical conditions and I recognise the urgency and constant worry felt by patients with very distressing illnesses. As a result I am committed to urgently reviewing Ireland&rsquo;s policy on medicinal cannabis. <\/p>  <p>  Cannabis-based preparations are strictly controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. However, it is open for an Irish registered doctor to apply for a licence for such preparations for an individual, named-patient. Such applications will be considered on a case by case basis.  The appropriateness of any particular treatment is a matter between the patient and their doctor. <\/p>  <p>  Cannabidiol (CBD) is derived from cannabis. However, since it does not have psychoactive properties it is not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. <\/p>  <p>  While I am aware that CBD oil is sometimes marketed as a nutritional or dietary supplement, it should be noted that it is not authorised as a medicinal product in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I recently asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) to examine the issue of permitting the use of cannabis-based products for medical purposes in Ireland.  The HPRA&rsquo;s statutory role is to protect and enhance human health by regulating medicines and other health products and it has the necessary clinical and scientific expertise to provide advice on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  Separately the Oireachtas Health Committee has now also begun to examine the issue of medicinal cannabis.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope to receive the report from the HPRA and the output from the Oireachtas Health Committee early in the New Year and I will then be in a position to consider future policy and progress any legislative changes that may be recommended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900095#WROO02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1571,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900095#WROO03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1572,"qnumday":607,"qnumall":"[37600\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900095#WROO03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when facilities (details supplied) will be opened; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1573,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900095#WROO03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":1574,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900095#WROO03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1575,"qnumday":608,"qnumall":"[37617\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900095#WROO03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will engage with the Department of Health to ensure that an anomaly in budget 2017 (details supplied) does not result in groups of pensioners losing their entitlement to medical cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1576,"content":"<p>Under the Health (Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) (No. 2) Act 2013, when a person attains the age of 70, the medical card income limits are &euro;500 gross income per week for a single person and &euro;900 gross income per week for a couple.  Any revision of these medical card income thresholds requires primary legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Persons aged 70 or older, who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds, may also have their eligibility assessed under the means-tested medical card scheme if they so wish, for example in the event that they face particularly high expenses, e.g. nursing home or medication costs.  This scheme is open to all persons, irrespective of their age and assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses.  The qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over-70s gross income thresholds.  In setting the assessment guidelines, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has regard to Government policy as outlined by the Minister for Health, changes in the consumer price index and other issues which may be relevant.  Furthermore, persons, including those aged over 70 years, may be deemed eligible for a medical card on a discretionary basis, if they are judged to face undue hardship in arranging GP services as a result of medical or social circumstances.

However, per capita figures are only one of a number of measures that can give a view of drugs spending in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The OECD report cited by the Deputy uses data from 2014, the last year for which full figures are available.  In 2014, expenditure on prescription and over the counter medicines accounted for just over 14 percent of overall health expenditure in Ireland.  Although this was higher than several other EU countries, including Denmark, Finland, and Belgium, it was lower than Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, and significantly lower than Greece or Hungary.<\/p>  <p>  OECD data on pharmaceutical expenditure includes expenditure on both prescription and over the counter medicines but excludes expenditure on Pharmaceuticals consumed in hospitals and other health care settings as part of an inpatient or day case treatment.

There has also been a number of significant developments since 2014 that will further reduce the cost of medicines in Ireland.  The Framework Agreement on the Pricing and Supply of Medicines will reduce the price of medicines to the average of 14 other countries and provides for an annual downward only price realignment.  This will ensure that Irish medicine prices continue to reduce in line with price reductions across reference countries.

The current Strategy contains an action to develop a sustained range of awareness campaigns that target third level educational institutions, workplaces and recreational venues.

These campaigns provide harm reduction information and advice, while emphasising that it's always safest not to take unknown or illicit drugs at all.

As required by the Act,\u00a0a National Mitigation Plan (NMP) is currently being prepared and I understand that this will be released shortly for a period of public consultation by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. Agricultural sectoral mitigation measures have been prepared for input to the NMP. <\/p><p>A range of actions are currently being undertaken to make Irish farming more environmentally sustainable, \u00a0including measures under the Rural Development Programme (RDP), which is worth almost &euro;4 billion over 7 years.\u00a0 The Programme is strongly targeted towards environmental benefits, including knowledge transfer programmes, which will bring the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers. <\/p><p>Other measures include GLAS, the Green, Low-Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme which offers opportunities to support emission reductions and carbon sequestration through various actions such as hedgerow and tree planting, minimum tillage and encouraging the sustainable management of upland peatlands, while at the same time addressing other environmental threats such as biodiversity and water quality.<\/p><p>The Beef Data and Genomics Programme is directly targeted at the climate emissions of 30,000 beef farmers. Its objective is to lower the intensity of GHG emissions by improving the quality and efficiency of the national beef herd <\/p><p>Furthermore, the establishment and maintenance of landscape features (for example, Ecological Focus Areas under CAP Pillar I) can assist with achieving other environmental objectives which are expected of land, such as water and biodiversity management, in addition to carbon sequestration benefits.<\/p><p>Ireland is a world leader in areas such as sustainable auditing and carbon foot-printing under the Origin Green programme.  Origin Green is a strategic priority in Food Wise 2025, the ten year strategy for the agri-food industry.<\/p><p>Also the Pasture Profit Index, the Carbon Navigator Tool and the Agricultural Catchments Programme help to reduce carbon emissions per unit of output produced and help protect our rivers. <\/p><p>All of these efforts are being implemented alongside an extensive afforestation scheme.  Afforestation is the main cost effective land based climate mitigation tool available to Ireland, followed by the above mentioned mitigation technologies in agriculture itself. Climate change mitigation by forests, forest fuels and wood products is one of the principal drivers of the policy to expand forest cover out to mid century.  Agriculture and afforestation are intrinsically linked in Ireland.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial\u00a0investment by the telecommunications sector\u00a0and through\u00a0a State intervention in those\u00a0areas where commercial investment has\u00a0not\u00a0 been fully demonstrated.\u00a0\u00a0   The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll out a new high-speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area, comprising\u00a0over 750,000 premises including approximately 20,300 premises in Co Kildare, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. \u00a0Householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 megabits per second but potentially up to 1000 megabits per second with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP. The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process. The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids. In addition, bidders need adequate time\u00a0to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process. It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed. I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process. I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one that will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. <\/p>  <p>  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline\u00a0to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area:<\/p>  <p>  - The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process. <\/p>  <p>  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Kildare.\u00a0 Members of the public can view whether their premises in\u00a0Kildare are in the BLUE or AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.<\/p>  <p>  I would encourage citizens\u00a0in\u00a0County Kildare who cannot access high speed broadband services to contact my Department directly at broadband@dccae.gov.ie, quoting their address and Eircode, and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services.\u00a0 This information will assist my Department to keep track of progress in those areas so that high speed broadband solutions can be found in parallel with the State Intervention high speed broadband network roll-out.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900100#WRTT01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Generation","counter":1790,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900100#WRTT01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1791,"qnumday":680,"qnumall":"[36876\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900100#WRTT01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide the performance output of energy generated by Mount Lucas wind farm, County Offaly.","asker":"1232","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1792,"content":"<p>The Single Electricity Market (SEM) is the wholesale electricity market for the island of Ireland since 2007.

Since 2002, the regulation of the gas market has been the responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is independent in the performance of its functions.  Decisions on the regulatory treatment of the gas network and tariffing are statutorily matters for the CER under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002. The CER, as the independent energy regulator, has a remit to protect energy consumers, ensure security of supply and support competitiveness. <\/p>  <p>  From 2011, in anticipation of the entry of Corrib gas into the system, and in pursuance of its duty to ensure that new sources of gas for the Irish market did not result in unwarranted increases in the price of gas to business and domestic consumers, the CER embarked on a process of reform of the regime governing the regulatory treatment of the two Ireland\/UK gas interconnectors and associated tariffing.  The rationale for the CER&rsquo;s proposed reform was that if the then current regime were to persist, new sources of gas coming onstream such as Corrib, and possible liquified natural gas (LNG), would cause the price of gas to rise significantly for all Irish consumers, regardless of the source of the supply.  Given our high dependence on gas for electricity generation this would also give rise to electricity price increases and would negatively impact on Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness. <\/p>  <p>  On 29 June 2012, following the usual consultation period, the CER published a high-level decision outlining its proposals for the new tariff regime.  This CER decision subsequently became the subject of a Judicial Review taken by Shannon LNG.  On 11 December 2013 the High Court upheld the CER decision of 29 June 2012.  I understand that Shannon LNG has appealed the High Court decision to the Supreme Court.<\/p>  <p>  Following an extensive period of consultation on how the 2012 decision would be implemented, the associated new tariffing regime was introduced with effect from 1st October 2015.  Full details are to be found in the CER Decision Paper of 23 July 2015 (CER\/15\/140) available from the CER website at www.cer.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900101#WRUU01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1821,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900101#WRUU01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1822,"qnumday":696,"qnumall":"[37218\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900101#WRUU01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the funding that has been provided to County Louth over the previous three years 2014 to 2016 by project name, location and funding amount, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1823,"qnumday":697,"qnumall":"[37234\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900101#WRUU01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the applications submitted for funding projects from Louth county council in each of the years 2014 to 2016 in tabular form; and if the applications were successful.","asker":"1329","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1824,"qnumday":698,"qnumall":"[37250\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900101#WRUU01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the funding for projects in 2017 in County Louth to be funded by his Department by project name, location and funding amount, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This is done initially through the use of of business tools which focus on the finances and overheads of the service.  For example, a fee calculation exercise looks at whether the fee being charged by the service is appropriate.  There is also a staff ratio calculation applied to look at the numbers of children in the service, when they are booked in, and what ratio needs to be applied.  For example, it may be that the service should take two fewer children in the morning, and two more in the afternoon in order to maximise the potential and run a viable service.  <\/p><p>This methodology has been found to be very effective in many services across the country, and whilst sometimes unpopular decisions have had to be made in the short term, the medium and long term results should justify these decisions.<\/p><p>I hope that the support offered to the services can assist them in reforming their services in order to enable them to continue.  I will of course be working extremely hard to seek further investment in childcare that will improve affordability for parents but also assist providers in running viable and high quality services.  My Department has long-standing relationships with community\/not-for-profit childcare providers, and recognises the important role that this sector has to play in childcare provision.  I can certainly empathise with the challenges these services face and I continuously commend all early years services, particularly those operating on a not for profit basis, for the work they do.  <\/p><p>The CCI review  is due to be completed shortly, but preliminary results suggest that some services became over-reliant on unqualified CE participants to be part of core staff ratios over the years.

This report will give us solid evidence which will also inform future policy.

It was clear from the review that the three brigade Army structure was no longer viable, particularly when compared to international norms.  <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces was implemented in order to ensure that the Defence Forces could operate efficiently and effectively within the revised strength ceiling of 9,500 personnel and was not focused on achieving savings.  The re-organisation encompassed the consolidation of the three under-strength brigades into two full strength brigades.  Key aspects of the re-organisation, which was introduced in 2012, included the consolidation of under-strength units into a smaller number of full strength units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and the associated re-deployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational units.  <\/p>  <p>  The re-organisation has maintained the operational capacity of the Defence Forces to the greatest extent possible within the available resource envelope and has improved the deployability and sustainability of the Defence Forces, both at home and overseas.  This remains a key focus for the future.  It is important to note that the re-organisation did not reduce the numbers of PDF personnel serving in locations within the former 4th Western Brigade area and I am satisfied that a return to a three brigade structure would cause a range of unnecessary inefficiencies, such as an increased administrative burden arising from the need to reintroduce a layer of non-operational middle management, and a return to under-strength units.     <\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence 2015 confirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to retain a PDF strength of at least 9,500 personnel and the continued retention of the Army&rsquo;s two Brigade structure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900108#WRBBB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Properties","counter":2088,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900108#WRBBB01650"},{"type":"question","counter":2089,"qnumday":802,"qnumall":"[37423\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112900108#WRBBB01700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of premises owned and or managed by his Department in each county;
