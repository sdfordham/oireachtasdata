There are more than 20,000 people outside the gates of Leinster House this afternoon.  This demonstration is being described as the biggest coming together of people in more than 15 years to demonstrate outside Leinster House.  The Irish Farmers Association is to be commended.  This demonstration is a reflection of the growing anger among rural families and the farming community at the Government's continued implementation of cuts to important schemes which supplement the incomes of farmers.<\/p><p>There are 300,000 people working in the agrifood sector which is worth \u20ac24 billion to the economy and reflects 20% of net exports.  The \u20ac1.6 billion in Common Agricultural Policy transfers through pillars 1 and 2 are critical to the future of the farming industry.  It is essential the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine continues to work at European level to secure these transfers into the future.  Fianna F\u00e1il will be moving a Private Members' motion in the D\u00e1il this week seeking a reversal of the cuts in this area and a tackling of the CAP issue.  I acknowledge the excellent debate in this House last week on the CAP.<\/p><p>I want also to touch on an issue which is affecting families, in particular the disabled, the elderly and the most vulnerable.<\/p> <p>Further cuts will be inflicted on home help services between now and the end of the year.  The Minister for Health, who has attracted much controversy of late, will sign off on cuts of &#8364;8 million to home help services.  This is in addition to cuts of 600,000 hours so far this year.  This is in stark contrast to the words in the programme for Government about the care of older people and community care.  I will read what is stated in it in order that the Labour Party and Fine Gael Members can reflect on them:<ul><br \/>Additional funding will be provided each year for the care of older people.  This funding will go to more residential places, more home care packages and the delivery of more home help and other professional community care services.<\/ul>We have seen cuts of &#8364;120 million in this area so far this year.  The Government is not fulfilling the commitments in the programme for Government and it is giving the two fingers to the elderly, the most vulnerable and the disabled.  It is an outright disgrace.  We will have a debate on this issue tomorrow in the House and I hope some of the Labour Party and Fine Gael Senators stand up for their convictions and vote with Fianna F\u00e1il on the Private Members' motion.<\/p><p> I propose an amendment to the Order of Business on behalf of 70,000 people who are being screwed by Allied Irish Banks because of last week's 0.5% increase in the variable interest rate.  This bank is 99.8% owned by the taxpayer and to date has received &#8364;21 billion in transfers from the State.  It runs its own affairs without interference by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, who has an obligation on behalf of the people to step up to the mark and tell the bank there can be no more pain or interest rate increases.  At a time when the ECB rate is at an all time low of 0.75%, the bank is charging 4% on variable rate mortgages.  It is time the Minister for Finance came to the House to explain what he will do to help these 70,000 home owners who are struggling and will find themselves coupled with the other 100,000 home owners who are in mortgage arrears.  In this regard we propose an amendment to the Order of Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900003#B00400","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349790000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I echo the words of many colleagues last Thursday in welcoming the reforms to the junior certificate programme announced by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn.  They are genuinely groundbreaking and will improve the educational experience of thousands of pupils.  We will have a debate in the House with the Minister in the coming weeks during which I am sure we will be able to discuss in more detail with him the nature of these reforms.<\/p><p>On a day when rural Ireland is coming to Dublin, I wish to mention a very urban issue.  I ask the Leader for a debate on how to improve urban centres.  Last week, a good deal of time was spent on the Order of Business speaking about crime on the streets.  People expressed real concern about the level of street crime.  In this context, I came across an initiative in the UK, begun by the Association of Town Centre Management, called the purple flag initiative.  Its website is purpleflag.org.uk.  It is a great idea whereby town centres, be they areas or districts in cities or smaller towns, apply for purple flag status - in the same way as we have blue flag beaches - to announce the area is safe for people at night and a pleasant place to be with good levels of cleanliness and security.  Belfast, Derry and Enniskillen on this island are all included, as are places such as Leicester Square in London where extensive efforts to reduce crime have been made by local businesses in co-operation with each other.  They also co-operate with the police to ensure licence enforcement.  The levels of cleanliness have increased and anyone who knows Leicester Square will know serious problems had arisen with litter.  All of this has been done under the purple flag initiative.  Similarly, Belfast's Cathedral Quarter has a purple flag because of a very clear but unobtrusive police presence, a good balance of outlets and a very pleasant environment, as anyone who has been there recently will agree.  It is an initiative we could very well do with in Ireland.  We could look at how we could adopt it in this country through the chambers of commerce and Dublin City Business Association.<\/p> <p>In the week where we heard about private businesses being asked to provide the public with access to their toilets, we can see there is a lack of public facilities and amenities for visitors to and residents of this city who are out at night.  That is true across other urban centres in Ireland.  Something like a purple flag initiative gives an incentive to businesses working with the local councils and public services to ensure their area and amenities are better for tourists and residents alike.  We could all imagine the great benefit we would see from that.   I ask the Leader for a debate on initiatives like the purple flag and how we could adapt them in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900004#C00200","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349790300,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I start by welcoming the comments by the former President, Mary McAleese, regarding marriage equality for LGBT people.  In an interview due to be broadcast tonight, Ms McAleese expresses her support for the institution of marriage being open to same sex couples.  On a related civil rights issue, I note the European Union's strong criticism of Serbia's decision to ban a gay pride parade from taking place in the capital Belgrade this past weekend.  This ban is part of a worrying trend in eastern Europe and Russia, prohibiting so-called gay propaganda - it sounds like we are in Uganda - with fines and prison terms being imposed.  Similar proposals which infringe basic civil rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly have been put forward in other states with aspirations for EU membership, such as Ukraine and Moldova.  Worryingly, such measures are also being mooted in current member states like Lithuania and Hungary.  Given Ireland's impending EU Presidency, these events are a timely reminder that the European Union must be rigorous in insisting on fundamental rights and that this is an integral aspect of our priorities with regard to the Presidency.<\/p><p>That brings me to my question for the Leader.  I recall the Taoiseach coming to this House last December to set out Ireland's priorities for our upcoming Presidency of the European Union and to hear our views on them.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Creighton, to the House to inform us of the preparations for the Presidency, what activities are planned, how the priorities are progressing and to perhaps respond to some of our earlier suggestions on the day of the Taoiseach's last visit.

All of those jobs are to be in place by 2016.<\/p><p>Listening this morning to the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, who published her annual report today, it was very welcome to hear her acknowledge that there has been a significant shift in how public bodies responded to her recommendations at all levels.  Throughout 2011, she saw a significant rise in the number of complaints but also a significant shift and a change in culture within public bodies.  Ms Logan has been campaigning for this for a number of years.  She has spoken at Oireachtas committee meetings about the difficulty she experienced in getting public bodies to adopt a child-centred approach.  That has changed.  She also commented that the Children First national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children have been adopted and implemented completely.  That is very positive news, particularly as we are in the middle of a referendum campaign which, again, will put children at the centre of how decisions are taken in this country.  It is a very positive step and I congratulate Ms Logan on her work in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900005#D00300","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"speech","time":1349790300,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The general scheme of a universities (amendment) Bill 2012 is now in circulation.

In the same report, an ISME spokesperson calls on the Government to reduce social welfare rates on the basis that it would make it more profitable to work in this country.  Let me be honest.  I cannot understand how A is equal to B while B is not equal to C.  Either we are cutting jobs or jobs are available.  I want to bring to the attention of the House recent research that showed social welfare rates in Ireland are not overly generous.  This is contrary to the views of ISME and other groups in the sector.<\/p><p>A number of issues relating to SMEs are critical to the future of Ireland.  One in particular, which relates to the insolvency legislation, is not often raised.  I ask the Leader to raise this with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The legislation is such that SMEs \u2013 the smaller the SME, the worse the circumstances \u2013 are last in the pecking order in cases of insolvency.  We have inherited a 19th century-type legal code in that the last people who can afford to be out of pocket are the smaller employers.  We need to examine the legislation in other jurisdictions where there is a percentage cut across the board, irrespective of the categories of secured and unsecured creditors.  We must look into our hearts, bearing in mind that the Revenue Commissioners are always the first to be paid.  If we are serious about improving the position of SMEs, we really must consider our insolvency legislation.

Greece is undergoing incredible austerity, which leads me to my main topic.  I congratulate Ms Ann Cahill of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i> who, on that newspaper's front page this morning, has drawn attention to the fact that the IMF has admitted its austerity measures are not working and that it is wrong.  This is partly based on the annual report of the IMF.  Buried three pages into the report is a statement that the organisation has made huge mistakes in imposing austerity measures and putting forward policies of austerity.  This echoes the report I mentioned on the record a number of times, namely, that of the UN Committee on Trade and Development, which has also said austerity is not working.  This is occurring at a time when the Finance Ministers of Europe are sitting down to set up the ESM, about which the markets are not optimistic.  The markets are saying the ESM will not work because the political solutions that need to be put in place across Europe are not being put in place.<\/p><p>  We do not see any deal on the table yet for Ireland regarding its bailout.  It is timely, therefore, that we call on the Minister for Finance to come to the House to debate the bailout once more.  Much new information has come to light.  It is obvious that the policy of austerity is not working.  Dole queues are longer and an increasing number of people are emigrating.  We do not see being created the jobs we will be discussing later in our debate on SME week.  It is very clear to us, therefore, that the austerity path is not the right one for Ireland.  It is overly punitive and leading to the types of cuts that are being flown by Ministers with regard to social welfare, etc., which do not represent the right approach.<\/p> <p>In Sinn F\u00e9in's opinion, the austerity path is not the right one.  It is imperative the Minister for Finance attend the House to discuss the bailout and its cost, not just in financial terms, but also in human terms.  The austerity cuts being imposed affect society and will have a detrimental impact for years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900006#E00300","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349790900,"counter":21,"content":"<p>This morning, Kerry Group announced the creation of 400 construction jobs as well as 800 permanent jobs in the coming years.

I listened to unbiased news of the story in which a certain broadcaster described it as fantastic.  I agree.  Ireland is uniquely positioned to service the permanent jobs, in that they are scientific and are highly skilled.  It is not a case of Kerry Group flying the Irish flag.  After investigating various global locations, it concluded that Naas was the best.  It is a vote of confidence in the country that Kerry Group, which has annual sales of \u20ac7 billion as well as many bases throughout the US, chose Ireland ahead of America.

Fine Gael specifically committed to reducing variable mortgage interest rates by 0.5% by gaining efficiencies in the banks, but the Government has put no effort into that commitment.  It is time it did something about the issue.  This is just one of a number of promises in election manifestos and the programme for Government that have been abandoned without a care in the world.  It is another property tax on families.  The programme for Government refers to a site valuation tax, doing everything possible for those in negative equity and so on, but nothing along those lines seems to be happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900007#F00300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1349790900,"counter":23,"content":"<p>It is outrageous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900007#F00400","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1349790900,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Yes.

However, there are other areas of banking that we also need to review.  The mortgage interest rate increases are unacceptable.  We have also had the recent discovery of the mis-selling of insurance products by the banking industry.  A significant number of people were forced into buying a product they did not need and from which they could derive no benefit.  The recent Ulster Bank fiasco can be thrown into the mix.  The recent Credit Review Office report showed that 100 cases were overturned where the banks refused businesses badly needed finance.  Those matters warrant discussion in this House.  From time to time there has been overcharging of customers.  We have reached a stage with banking that this House needs to debate and discuss it.

All of this penury and misery comes from the IMF, which has now acknowledged that those of us on the left were right when we said that austerity coupled with tax and cuts would drive us into recession.  We have been the good citizens of Europe and have been punished for it.  It is harrowing to think of the whole of democracy in Greece starving because of this.  There has been much talk of the visit of the slave master from Germany to Greece to see how people, while starving, are progressing, which is a reproach to all of us.  The principle enunciated by Emily Logan in regard to the children hangs over this.  They put the preservation of the system above the welfare of the citizen, which is always wrong.  The welfare of the people in a democracy must always come first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900008#G00400","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349791500,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the issue of private schools.

This is not happening in any maligned banking utopia; it is happening here in Ireland.  Despite the lawless state in which Irish banks, State-owned and otherwise, exist, our Financial Regulator is yet to intervene, while the Central Bank appears to be vocal on macro issues only and not national banking issues of paramount importance.<\/p><p>What is happening is a scandal.  Five days ago I first raised the matter of data audits revealing the misreporting of credit histories of thousands of customers to the Irish Credit Bureau by Permanent TSB and AIB.  On that day I wrote to David Duffy, the CEO of AIB, and Jeremy Masding of PTSB to request them to right this wrong and defamatory act with regard to credit reports for their customers and make a goodwill gesture to those whose details they erroneously and adversely entered.  I also requested they establish a helpline to deal with the issue and ensure anyone using the helpline would be reimbursed.  Their lack of response shows a complete failure by these banking institutions to make themselves accountable to the public for their negligence in dealing with their customers' credit histories.<\/p><p>It is important that we do not forget the significance of these errors.  To input an adverse credit finding against a customer in Irish Credit Bureau records is to suggest he or she is insolvent, which gives the message that the person cannot pay his or her debts as they fall due.  This is not only defamatory with ramifications for a person's good name, but it may prevent the person from obtaining finance.  It is clear from the banks' actions that they are not listening, they are not interested in listening, and they do not care what unmitigated mess they inflict on the lives of their unsuspecting customers.  So far, the response of Permanent TSB and AIB has been lamentably poor.  We need the Minister for Finance, the Financial Regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank to intervene in the matter.  I can confirm that in the absence of the rogue banks responding to me I have been left with no alternative than to make contact with the aforementioned to hold them to account for their negligence.  It is clear that we, their customers, still rank bottom in priority despite all of the guarantees to the contrary.<\/p> <p>We must be mindful that it was we, as taxpayers, who bailed out these institutions whose response is to affect the lives of their customers in such a negative way.  On behalf of those people affected by erroneous reporting of credit histories, I want to know whether Irish banks will ensure their customers can have peace of mind.  I have failed to be convinced of this thus far.  In the circumstances, I reiterate my calls made during the Ulster Bank fiasco for a banking inquiry to get to the bottom of the continuous and horrendous mismanagement by the banks' directors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900010#J00400","speaker":"1173","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349792100,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I call on Senators to support the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900011#K00200","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1349792100,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I remind Members that of all the speakers today, only two people complied with their time constraints.

I add my voice to those welcoming our farmers to Dublin today.  Farming is a vitally important part of our national life and some of the best of what we are is to be found in farming communities.  It is a time of optimism in farming with the possibility for it to contribute to our national recovery.  I think of the proposals in Food Harvest 2020.  It is always important that we do not have the politics of envy around farming and that people recognise the sacrifices made by and the unsociable hours worked by farmers.  Ensuring that people can not just make a living in farming but a decent living should always be central to national policy.  We should look with great interest at the numbers of young people coming into farming life and ensure that they are able to continue that essential part of our national life.<\/p><p>I was not educated in a fee-paying school but I very much disagree with the Minister of State for Public and Commuter Transport, Deputy Alan Kelly, and wonder where he is coming from and who in government put him up to saying what he said.  I dislike the politics of envy.<\/p> <p>Based on figures of the Department of Education and Skills, it has been shown that those in fee-paying schools cost the State approximately \u20ac3,500 less than others.  If this is multiplied by the number attending fee-paying schools, one arrives at a figure amounting to tens of millions of euro.  This is quite close to the sum it is claimed would be saved by ceasing the funding of fee-paying schools.<\/p><p>We must recognise that everybody has a right to an education.  It is entirely appropriate to pay for the teachers to educate pupils, regardless of their means.  We should, by all means, tax those who have more, but I would not like to see circumstances in which only the rich could afford to go to fee-paying schools.  Fee-paying schools have, by and large, contributed to a culture of solidarity.  In this regard, I am familiar with the great work being done by the Holy Ghost schools, for example, and their work with Aidlink, a related charity.  I know that students from St. Mary's College in Rathmines go, in great solidarity and with the proper spirit, to Ghana very regularly.  They do not go for a holiday.  This activity is not just happening in fee-paying schools.  Is would be wrong, however, to engage in the politics of envy and to try to portray the matter as one in which well-off people are funded at the expense of the poor.  That is not what is happening because it is cheaper to fund the education of a person who is attending a fee-paying school as his parents are already making sacrifices to contribute to his or her education.  It is good that parents are ambitious for their children's education.  We should encourage that.<\/p><p>We need to work against disadvantage in education.  While we already do so, it is not enough.  We must stop targeting others who, on the surface, appear to have more but in reality are making more of a sacrifice.  The appropriate approach is to promote a culture of excellence, sacrifice and participation by parents, who, in some cases, forgo holidays and other privileges because they want to invest in their children's education.  I wish them good luck.  Let us stop sniping at them and trying to put them in a more disadvantageous situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900011#K01300","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349792700,"counter":57,"content":"<p>My colleagues have been talking about mortgages and the effect of the increase in the mortgage interest rate.

The Property Services Regulatory Authority was established under the Property Services (Regulation) Act in 2011 but the problem is that significant numbers have not yet registered.

At the meeting earlier today, Senator O'Neill raised this issue, which was unanimously agreed on by all members present from all parties and none.  We discussed exactly what Senator O'Neill has outlined regarding the attitude towards discards.  The issue has arisen in this House in the past few years.  The Commissioner responsible for fisheries is already on record as saying she is against discards but there has been no further clarification or extension of those remarks on how she will deal with the issue.  Running in parallel with the Common Agricultural Policy is a review of the Common Fisheries Policy, which is sometimes forgotten about.  I share Senator O'Neill's concern, which mirrors the sentiment of the House and the general public, as a result of what we saw on our television screens last week.  Monkfish is very expensive but it was handed out for free, and the individual responsible for that action will be subject to legal sanctions.  Some comment should be made but there has been a deafening silence on the matter.  I have heard no official reaction or response to what happened on Kilmore Quay last week other than what was in the media.  If the boat owner in question had delayed his landing and left the boat on the quay, ferrying people to the boat to collect the fish, I wonder if that would have constituted landing the fish, as he would have been at sea.  The chances are that it would have been a technicality and he would not have landed the fish.  That shows the absurdity of this policy.

For those companies wishing to grow, an international perspective is built upon engagement with our EU neighbours.  To be competitive in the modern economy, Irish businesses must be at ease with globalisation.  This means doing business in more than one country must become the norm.<\/p><p>We want to ensure that new companies learn to develop products with global appeal and market them internationally early on in the product development cycle.  My role as Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with responsibility for small business and as SME envoy for Ireland is to ensure that small businesses play a central role in our economic recovery.  As SME envoy for Ireland in the European group of national SME envoys, I am focussed on ensuring that policies developed at national, regional and local level are enterprise-friendly and harness the think small first principle in order to strengthen the competitiveness of SMEs and to unleash their potential to grow and create jobs.  The decision to make this appointment at ministerial rather than official level reflects the Government's commitment to SMEs.  <\/p><p>The role of SME envoy was established as part of the review of the EU small business Act, which was launched in February 2011 and is a major landmark in tracking the implementation of the small business Act.  It aims to maintain the momentum in the journey towards a more entrepreneurial Europe and integrates the small business Act with the Europe 2020 strategy.  Six of the seven Europe 2020 flagship initiatives will help SMEs achieve sustainable growth, putting small businesses at the heart of EU policy.<\/p><p>While acknowledging that much has already been done in terms of putting the needs of SMEs to the forefront of EU policy, the small business Act review signals that more needs to be done through further significant measures to release the full potential of SMEs.  The small business Act contains a number of legislative proposals, ten guiding principles and measures to be implemented at EU and member state level, with the aim of helping SMEs.  These ten guiding principles are: the creation of an environment within which entrepreneurs and family businesses can thrive and entrepreneurship is rewarded; to ensure that honest entrepreneurs who have faced bankruptcy quickly get a second chance; to design rules according to the think small first principle; to make public administrations responsive to SMEs' needs, promoting e-government and one-stop-shop solutions; to adapt public policy tools to SME needs; to facilitate SMEs' participation in public procurement and better use state aid possibilities for SMEs; to facilitate SME access to finance and develop a legal and business environment supportive to timely payment in commercial transactions; to help SMEs to benefit more from the opportunities offered by the single market; to promote the upgrading of skills in SMEs and all forms of innovation; to enable SMEs to turn the environmental challenges into opportunities; and to encourage and support SMEs to benefit from the growth of markets.<\/p><p>These ten guiding principles are backed up with 42 implementing measures to be undertaken by the Commission and 51 by member states.  One of the key EU initiatives designed to help SMEs in the coming years is the Competitiveness and SMEs, COSME, programme 2014-20.  SMEs are a major source of economic growth and job creation in the EU, accounting for more than 67 % of private sector jobs and providing more than 58% of total turnover in the EU. <\/p> <p>Approximately 23 million SMEs exist throughout the EU, and they are an important contributor to growth and employment in the Union.  If the Union is to deliver its Europe 2020 strategy priorities of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, then competitiveness needs to be centre stage.  The EU Commission finds the main challenges which SMEs continue to face include: difficulties in accessing finance; a weak entrepreneurial spirit; a business environment which is not conducive to start-ups and growth; a limited capacity to adapt to a low-carbon resource-efficient economy; and a limited capacity to expand to markets beyond their home country.<\/p><p>The new programme for the competitiveness of enterprises and SMEs, COSME, will run from 2014 to 2020, with a planned budget of \u20ac2.5 billion.  The general aim of the programme is to strengthen the competitiveness and sustainability of EU enterprises, and to encourage an entrepreneurial culture promoting the creation and growth of SMEs.  Ireland very much supports the proposals to establish a dedicated programme for industrial competitiveness and SMEs, which will provide targeted financial support for SMEs.  In particular, we welcome the proposed equity facility for growth-phase investment, which will support the development of the EU-wide venture capital market.  We also welcome the loan facility, which will provide direct or other risk sharing arrangements with financial intermediaries to cover loans for SMEs.<\/p><p>As part of the new COSME programme, the Irish Enterprise Europe Network will assist all Irish SMEs to access the new supports available to them, including the new SME instruments made available through the Horizon 2020 programme.  The Enterprise Europe Network in Ireland is organised by Enterprise Ireland in partnership with chambers in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Sligo and Waterford.  The network helps companies by raising awareness of EU legislation, customer engagement marketing, EU funding programmes, technology transfer and business partnerships for which they have a database with up to 14,000 live business and technology opportunities for Irish companies to tap into.<\/p><p>Since it was established in 2008, the Irish network has had 34,000 interactions with Irish SMEs looking for support under the competitiveness and innovation programme framework.  The Irish network has organised 225 events for SMEs with approximately 10,000 participants.  The Irish network also works with all other business support organisations in Ireland such as Enterprise Ireland, the county and city enterprise boards, Chambers Ireland, the Small Firms Association and the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME.  The network's services are free of charge and provide real practical support for this critically important sector.<\/p><p>The European enterprise networks are also participants in European SME week, which was established in 2009 and is co-ordinated by the European Commission.  It aims to promote enterprise throughout Europe in line with the Commission communication concerning a small business Act for Europe.  It is a very important event in highlighting the critical role of SMEs throughout the EU.  This year, European SME week takes place between 15 to 21 October and aims to provide the following: information on what the EU and national, regional and local authorities offer as support to micro, small and medium-sized businesses; promote entrepreneurship in order that more people, in particular younger people, seriously consider becoming an entrepreneur as a career option; and give recognition to entrepreneurs for their contribution to Europe's welfare, jobs, innovation and competitiveness.  A European SME week summit will also take place in Brussels on 17 October, and the theme of the conference will be women's entrepreneurship.<\/p><p>European SME week will take place in 37 countries, and national, regional and local events and activities will be as close as possible to existing and potential entrepreneurs.  These events, organised by business organisations, business support providers and national, regional and local authorities, will also enable existing companies to share their experiences and develop themselves further.  In Ireland, 46 events will take place throughout the country during SME week.  The majority of these events are being organised by the local county enterprise boards and cover a wide variety of events including project management, women in business, starting one's own business, project branding and financial management.  Events are also being organised by the Irish Banking Federation, the Small Firms Association and the Crafts Council of Ireland.<\/p> <p> SME week 2012 also coincides with the 20th anniversary of the Single Market.  To mark the occasion, my Department, along with the European Commission in Dublin, have organised a joint Single Market-SME event in Croke Park on 1 November 2012 in order to highlight the importance of SMEs.  This event is entitled \"Europe at work for Irish SMEs: Irish SMEs and the Single Market\".  The Minister and I and leading officials from the Commission will be speaking at the event.  Senior officials from the Commission, enterprise agencies and SMEs in Ireland have been invited to attend this event and participate in the break-out sessions.  The break-out sessions will cover such topics as access to finance for SMEs, the digital Single Market, entrepreneurship and accessing the Single Market.  This event will be a precursor to Ireland's hosting of the EU Presidency beginning on 1 January 2013 and will signal the importance we attach to creating the right conditions and environment in Europe in order to promote growth and jobs and help our SMEs to grow, innovate and internationalise.<\/p><p>Next year, the focus on SMEs will be very clearly shown by an informal Competitiveness Council which will target the SME sector.  As part of the Irish Presidency of the EU, an informal Competitiveness Council will be held in Dublin on Wednesday, 1 May 2013.  The focus of this Council will be on SMEs, for example, access to finance, internationalisation of SMEs, entrepreneurship, etc.  This is a signal of the importance Ireland attaches to creating the right conditions and environment in Europe in order to promote growth and jobs and help our SMEs to grow and internationalise.  The agenda for this informal meeting is being drafted but it is likely that the discussion will focus on topics such as access to finance for SMEs, promoting entrepreneurship in Europe and SMEs going global.  The informal meeting will also deal on day 2 with research and innovation-oriented topics but linked to the overall enterprise, SME access and commercialisation agenda.  The proposed agenda for this informal Council will also deal with the contribution of research and innovation to sustainable economic growth and jobs and building Europe's competitive advantage.<\/p><p>Embracing international trade and harnessing the extensive opportunities in the European Single Market for Irish SMEs is essential to Ireland's continued expansionary economic performance.  The EU must become almost like an extended home marketplace for our SMEs if they are to grow and succeed.  The Government is acutely aware of the importance of the small business sector, its potential for generating employment and the problems encountered by entrepreneurs in accessing finance.  Our programme for Government and the Action Plan for Jobs fully recognises this fact.  The action plan is being delivered and is in the process of helping Ireland to become the best small country in which to do business by 2016.  Our actions in respect of the EU agenda in the coming year will contribute to the achievement of this goal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900019#T00300","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349796000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his wide-ranging presentation and wish him continued success with his portfolio on small and medium business.  As we have said here many times, SMEs are major contributors to the economy in Ireland and employment.  The importance of these firms cannot be underestimated.  Of the 195,000 SMEs in Ireland that involve just over 850,000 people, 90% employ fewer than ten people.  While many SMEs focus exclusively on the domestic market, a large proportion trade on international markets.  There is potential for so many more firms to internationalise and this could be made a reality if they were to receive better financial banking from the banks.  Over 70% of SMEs are involved across a broad spectrum of products, such as software, medical technologies, food production, digital content, retail and wholesale, and tourism.<\/p> <p>As we have said previously in the House, SMEs are present in all regions and contribute to building a community while enhancing a location's attractiveness as a place to live and do business.<\/p><p> European SME week is to take place from Monday, 15 October to Friday, 19 October.  The campaign is co-ordinated by the European Commission, which focuses correctly on promoting SMEs in 37 countries across Europe.  Events have been organised throughout the country by Enterprise Ireland, the city and county enterprise boards and business organisations to enable existing businesspeople to share their experience with potential entrepreneurs and develop further their own businesses.<\/p><p> On Friday last, I had the pleasure of attending an event associated with the first ever National 50+ Enterprise Day, which was launched by the Minister of State and organised by the city and county enterprise boards.  Over 55 potential entrepreneurs were in attendance.  The driver of this fascinating initiative is Mr. John Byrne, who has made the idea of senior enterprise acceptable and attractive.  I never heard of the concept of senior enterprise until last Friday.  Senior enterprise has been approved recently for support by the European Union through INTERREG IVB, an EU initiative that aims to stimulate inter-regional co-operation.  Senior enterprise is specifically designed to encourage greater involvement with enterprise by people over the age of 50.  This may be achieved through starting a business alone or with others, acquiring or investing in a business and advising an entrepreneur or supporting innovation within a business owned by another person.<\/p><p> National Women's Enterprise Day is to take place on 17 October, with an event in Portlaoise.  I have been honoured to have been invited by Ms Sarah Reilly of Fine Gael, a town council chairman, to speak at a very influential conference on women leading the way.  In particular, I have been asked to speak about my business and political experience in order to empower other women to do as I did.<\/p><p> In spite of the recession, it is most heartening that so many Irish men and women are taking the risk of starting their own businesses.  I commend Enterprise Ireland and the various relevant organisations that do such sterling work on prompting support for small businesses starting out and larger, more established businesses.  The good news is that so many Irish men and women are willing, in the middle of a recession, to start up businesses.  It takes courage and one must be able to take risks.  One must be a gambler because the chance of a business surviving is very low.<\/p><p> It was with much amazement that I read in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>yesterday morning a one-to-one interview with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  Bearing in mind all the occasions on which I referred in the House to banks not lending money and his reply that they are doing so, he is quoted in the article as saying banks have recoiled completely from lending to small businesses.  I will be fascinated to hear what Senator Clune will have to say about that.  The Minister stated that we must &quot;retool the whole finance system&quot;.  Furthermore, he stated: &quot;You've seen the credit figures yourself - banking has completely recoiled from lending to small business.  That has to be rebuilt.&quot;  The good news outlined by the Minister is that we can &#8220;with absolute confidence point to more high-potential start-ups this year&#8221;.  He has moved from referring to job numbers under the action plan for jobs to talking about the number of potential start-ups.  This is a good yardstick.<\/p><p> As the Minister of State will know, the ninth report of the Credit Review Office, CRO, was released yesterday.  It shed more light on the reality of bank lending to SMEs and farms.  Mr. John Trethowan, the credit reviewer, outlined the activities of his office since his last report, in June, and highlighted his observations on the market conditions in the SME sector.<\/p> <p>Until Mr. John Trethowan's ninth report, the CRO believed the banks' assertions that they were lending money.  The banks got a shock when he disagreed with them after approximately 18 months.<\/p><p>Mr. Trethowan criticised the banks for not lending, something that the Central Bank has stated in three reports.  In his report, he urged business people seeking loans to make formal written applications and stated: &quot;Much work has been done to standardise the information required for a loan application&quot;.  In many banks, a business person who asks for a loan to expand a business is told by someone in the branch not to bother because he or she would not get the money.  Mr. Trethowan has learned of such incidences.  According to him, people should make formal written applications and not be put off by their local branches.  It is important that small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, and farm owners not be dissuaded from applying for credit by the comments or actions of a few front line bank staff or the media.<\/p><p>I raised the crunch issue on the Order of Business.  The banks claim that they loaned \u20ac3 billion last year and will loan \u20ac3.5 billion this year, as they were asked to do.  How much of that amount is for risk taking in business rather than, for example, increasing overdrafts or safe customers?  Is it just a rolling over of credit, which is useless?  This matter must be addressed urgently.<\/p><p>What is the Minister of State's opinion on the comments of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, in the article referred to?  I imagine that the Minister regrets what he has been saying for eight or nine months.  Senator Mullins has discussed the issue.  How does he view the Minister's statement that the banks are not lending money?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900021#V00200","speaker":"1156","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349796600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for discussing SMEs and his work in that regard.  We are facing into European SME week, which is another important milestone in the development of a strong SME culture in Ireland.  I congratulate the Minister of State on the advisory group that he established.  It has fed into the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 and will do likewise in respect of the upcoming 2013 programme.<\/p><p>Kerry Group made a significant announcement today concerning new jobs in Kildare.  That campus will not be an SME, but for every job established at that level, there will be an estimated spin-off of 2 jobs in the community.  It is important that we recognise this aspect of the development.<\/p><p>Last week or the week before, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, launched the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, GEM, 2011 report for Ireland.  There were some positive elements, but the low number of people perceiving opportunities for new businesses was a concern.  That number saw no signs of increasing in 2011.  The microfinance scheme was opened for business on Monday, 1 October.<\/p> <p>I hope that scheme, which will provide \u20ac90 million in microfinance, will be successful in encouraging entrepreneurial activity.  Many people have the skills and drive to start up a business but they feel it might be risky to do so in the current climate.  The microfinance scheme will give them the necessary encouragement.<\/p><p>The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, is conscious of the importance of social insurance for self-employed people and is looking at the issue.  Issues such as this must be resolved to give people the confidence to set up their own business.<\/p><p>The global entrepreneurship report also found that men are 2.5 times more likely than women to be early stage entrepreneurs.  It is crucial that this issue be addressed.  Senator White referred to a conference at which she is speaking next week, and I wish her well with that.  Earlier this year, Enterprise Ireland established a \u20ac250,000 competitive feasibility fund targeted at female entrepreneurs.  The fund closed in September.  Has the Minister an update on the progress of the fund?<\/p><p>The report also noted a higher rate of business closures in 2011 than in the previous ten years.  We had a difficult year in 2011.  With this in mind, the credit guarantee scheme will provide support for job-creating SMEs.  Initiatives such as SME week and the conference to be held on 1 November will be very important in this regard.<\/p><p>On Saturday last, I attended a conference in Cork organised by Network Cork, a network for women in business.  At the conference, Mr. Se\u00e1n Kelly, MEP noted that it is 20 years since the European Single Market came into effect.  The Minister of State also referred to this in his speech today.  A range of opportunities have arisen since then.  We have cheaper international telephone calls, cheaper flights, services trading across borders, better procurement rules and a more level playing field for consumers.  All of these developments help SMEs trade across borders.  Nevertheless, the figures show that Irish SMEs do not engage sufficiently with their European counterparts.  The idea of the Single Market and the expansion of the EU was that we would have a single market of 500 million people.  Only 40% of Irish SMEs trade within Europe and only 13% trade outside the EU.<\/p><p>Culture and language are also important if SMEs are to do business with other countries.  Some contributors at Saturday's conference spoke about the importance of language and culture.  Doing business in Italy, for example, is different from doing business in Germany.  In Germany, one is paid on time and one knows where one stands, whereas in Italy, one must take a more laid back approach.  Knowing the language is very important.<\/p><p>The issue of language comes up time and again.  A recent report from the expert group on future skills needs identified the fact that our teaching of foreign languages is not up to the required standard.  We must develop a five to ten year programme for the teaching of foreign languages in our schools.  That should include Mandarin, although I accept that we are concentrating on EU trade this week.  We are falling down in our foreign language skills, and they are very important.  It is not necessary to be fluent in a language, but we should know enough to do business, be polite and engage with business people in other countries.  That goes a long way.  The importance of personal contact cannot be overstated.  It is more effective than e-mail or texting.  The support of the Minister will be important for SMEs who want to progress to trading abroad in other EU countries.<\/p><p>Access to credit has been mentioned by many speakers.<\/p> <p>I note that Mr. Trethowan's report this week was critical of the banks.  It is the second report in a row, the eighth and ninth, to be so critical.  He outlined how he had ensured 100 decisions were overturned, which led to \u20ac10 million being made available through the supply of credit and almost 850 jobs being supported.  That is very encouraging.  All companies that have been refused credit, even where there is a perceived verbal refusal, should be encouraged to progress the matter by dealing with it through the channels that have been set up, as outlined in Mr. Trethowan's report.  He gives some very significant examples of how credit was denied to well established businesses and businesses with a credible business plan and potential.<\/p><p>The retail sector is one in which the Minister of State has a great interest.  It is suffering at present.  Consumer sentiment is at a very low level.  It is understandable because people do not have confidence and are worried.  They are anxious to hold onto whatever money they have and they are certainly managing their spending.  The retail sector has suffered extensively as a result.  In the run up to the Christmas period the Minister should use his very public platform to encourage people to buy Irish and not to buy on-line unless it is from an Irish company.  He should encourage people to support their local traders, particularly those who have set up businesses in our cities and towns.  They need to be supported in the spending period between now and Christmas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900023#X00200","speaker":"1114","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349797200,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I always enjoy his visits to the House because we have good debates on this important topic.<\/p><p>We reoriented the economy too much towards construction and public administration.  It is very difficult that correcting that orientation increases unemployment from 4% to 14.8%, as it currently stands.  However, the Minister is moving in the right direction.  We must try to move away from an economy where so many auctioneers and solicitors were transferring property to each other, with banks completely obsessed by property and missing the enterprises the Minister of State is here to promote.<\/p><p>There are still problems with finance.  We own AIB and we used to own the Industrial Credit Corporation, ICC.  I approved of the sale of ICC because when the economy was booming it did not matter.  However, are there some ICC executives or people of that type around to form a wing within AIB dedicated to entrepreneurship and small business?  Are those talents still around?  Perhaps the Minister would investigate whether they are there.  We need something like that, as it was a great start-up institution.  I recall a report from Bloxham Stockbrokers which stated that our pillar banks were hardly interested in small and medium enterprises at all.  They opted entirely for the property bug and people relied on the foreign banks to provide the finance for small and medium enterprises.  However, those banks will not stay here now because the Government is supporting the pillar banks so strongly.  Therefore, there is a gap and perhaps a new type of ICC, as a branch within the State-owned AIB, might be considered.<\/p><p>With so many premises empty in our towns and cities, embarrassingly so at this stage, upward-only rent reviews should be examined.  I hear criticisms from the owners of small and medium enterprises that local authorities are increasing rents to businesses that are renting premises from those authorities.  That is also worth examining.<\/p><p>In the transport sector, after 80 years of trying to put small bus companies out of business, those companies actually own 80% of the fleet.  It is wrong to have direct award contracts instead of competitive tendering.<\/p> <p>Such people could have very fine start-up businesses, were the State to allow them to tender for procurement.  However, the literature on procurement produced by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation does not wash in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, just down the street.  That Department simply does not want to know and actually boasts in its literature that, as it got a direct award contract, there was no competitive tendering.  In response, I say, \"Thanks a lot guys\".  We are trying to develop economics in the country and not promote monopoly, as the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is so prone to do.  Moreover, there also are elements of this problem in tourism.  As the Minister of State is aware, part of the cost is that the NAMA hotels undermined commercial hotels, which undermined bed and breakfast businesses, which are the small businesses that might develop.  Consequently, one must look again at how capital subsidies availed of by large entrepreneurs and producers put the smaller person out of business on the basis of unfair competition.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State is aware, Senator Mary Ann O'Brien has made great speeches about the problems associated with sick leave and I refer to the figures I received from ISME yesterday.  That organisation states that in small enterprises, the average employee is sick for three days a year.  The rate is six days in larger enterprises - because the personal touch is lost - and is 12 days in the public sector.  However, the Department of Social Protection picks up the tab in the public sector and, therefore, an effort to effect a reduction in people absenting themselves sick in the economy, which I would support, probably should start in the health service, which is where the main rate of absenteeism occurs.  However, to push the cost onto small enterprises, the representatives of which claim the lowest number of sick leave absences, is something the Minister of State may wish to consider.<\/p><p>As for recessions, one never knows.  Ryanair was launched during the last recession and I believe it employs 8,000 people at present.  Its first flight was from Watford to Gatwick in 1985 and it now carries 85 million passengers.  The Kerry Group was launched in the 1970s and one of Deputy Perry's ministerial predecessors, Mark Clinton, virtually gave away the Dairy Disposal Company because he thought Denis Brosnan would do a much better job and we are celebrating the success of that vision today.  Perhaps there are activities within the public sector that could be transferred to small and medium-sized enterprises.  Denis Brosnan started out with a small to medium-sized enterprise, which no longer is the case, and everyone has gained today from that.<\/p><p>As for enterprise boards, I am concerned about them being associated with local government because it is known from the McLoughlin report that local government in Ireland has massive inefficiencies, particularly at managerial level.  Is there a danger that some of these inefficiencies could transfer themselves into the vital work enterprises do?  My other misgiving concerns Forf\u00e1s moving to the Department.  It did have independence and carried out useful work.  I can appreciate the reason it was a good idea to bring it in because the Department got all those talented people.  However, will they become more like traditional civil servants or will they lose their dynamism by coming into the Department?  Will some of the talented people leave because the Department does not have the reputation for being the most enterprising or innovative in the world?  I support the points made by Senator Clune about the teaching of languages and Members also have stressed the teaching of mathematics, both of which are vital.  In addition, one should support people like Jerry Kennelly in County Kerry, who is running entrepreneurship events in schools and is generating huge enthusiasm each year when the awards are given out.<\/p><p>The policies the Minister has outlined are excellent but one must make sure that each institution, law and public body is in tune with what the Department is trying to do.  It is in this spirit I made these suggestions, particularly on what is to be done with AIB.  Will it be possible to develop a section similar to the industrial credit corporation in AIB?  While we now own it, we do not do so to enable it to go back to being a property-obsessed bank, which got itself into trouble the last time.  I wish the Minister of State good luck as Members will be watching out and will be wishing him all the best in his endeavours.  This is the way to reformulate the Irish economy for which I am sure he has widespread support in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900025#Z00200","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349797500,"counter":142,"content":"<p>As usual, the Minister of State is welcome.  He has been highly proactive in the small business area as he comes from such a background.  Small and medium-sized enterprises, together with the farming industry, are so important.  I note representatives of the latter were here in force today outside Leinster House.  The problem for any small business in today's economy is accessing liquidity or credit to keep afloat.<\/p> <p> Many businesses are on the margins of survival.  We have many initiatives in place which are helping.  It will be a long road but it will be successful in the end.<\/p><p>I refer to the Credit Review Office.  According to the latest figures on bank decisions, overturned applications are up 35%.  I said previously that it would be a more efficient use of the Credit Review Office's time to put a stamp of approval on applications before they hit the bank because there seems to be a time delay.  Sometimes banks put applicants off either at the front desk or over the telephone rather than take a formal application.  On many occasions, good applications are turned down by the banks only for the decision to be overturned by the Credit Review Office.<\/p><p>John Trethowan said that in the past three months, the Credit Review Office received 36 eligible applications from SMEs refused credit by AIB and Bank of Ireland - the two pillar banks - that work is ongoing on 12 cases and that three have been withdrawn.  He also said that of the 21 cases completed in this quarter, 14 bank refusals were overturned resulting in the two banks subsequently supplying \u20ac1.18 million of credit, supporting a further 106 part-time and full-time jobs in the SME sector.  The banks must be dragged into this equation because without the existence of the Credit Review Office, those 106 jobs would have been at risk and people may have ended up on the dole.  <\/p><p>I give credit to John Trethowan but he must get support from the banks.  In his ninth quarterly review, which was issued yesterday, he said that only three banks are actively lending in the SME sector, namely, Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank.  He pointed out that there is a lack of competition in lending which, over the years, was a driver of credit, although maybe overdriving it.  However, the banks are now probably sitting back and hoping people do not come in looking for loans because they do not want to take the risk.  With pressure from the Government, the banks have to lend.  They have been looked after by the taxpayer and we effectively own them.  At times, the banks do not give credit when first asked.  <\/p><p>I said previously that there is a negative perception among small businesses and farmers that they are wasting their time applying for loans because there seems to be a perception - it is fostered by a few front line staff in banks - that people should not bother applying for loans because they will probably not get them.  There is perhaps negative media coverage of banks and people are afraid to go in.  If one has a small businesses, is trying to get one's feet on the ground and is struggling to meet wage bills, tax returns and suppliers, the last thing one wants is a session with a bank, which can be intimidating.  <\/p><p>I said previously the Credit Review Office could play a role in giving an indication to the client that he or she should go for the loan based on a very good application.  There is a role for the accountant to put the loan package application together very well rather than shabbily.  The banks would get an indication that the Credit Review Office has looked at the application and is favourable towards it.  That might speed up the process and keep a business going because currently, for small businesses waiting one month or two months for a decision, it can be the difference between surviving and not surviving.  Survival means the preservation of five, ten, 50 or 100 jobs, as John Trethowan outlined.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister of State's efforts, which are being successful.  I come from a small business background and it is difficult to survive in a recession.  Senator Barrett said some of the bigger companies come out of recessions but there are many stories of small businesses which have been wiped out.  They are just statistics.  Ryanair is probably the exception as is the Kerry Group and they come out of recessions stronger.<\/p> <p>Businesses employing two, three or four employees are the backbone of the economy along with small farmers and shopkeepers.  I would encourage the Credit Review Office, CRO, to continue its good work and ask the banks to meet their obligations because if businesses are not making money, the banks are not making money and until the banks start making money again and repay the taxpayer, we will be in a downward spiral.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900026#AA00200","speaker":"1144","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349798400,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I call Senator Michael Mullins who has eight minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900028#CC00200","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1349798400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900028#CC00300","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1349798400,"counter":147,"content":"<p>On a point of order, should the next speaker not be from the Opposition?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900028#CC00400","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1349798400,"counter":148,"content":"<p>According to the rota, the next speaker will be an Independent Senator from the universities panel but there is no one offering and therefore we went on to the second rota.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900028#CC00500","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1349798400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>In that case would it not be the practice for another member of the Opposition who is offering, such as myself, to be called?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900028#CC00600","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1349798400,"counter":150,"content":"<p>If you wish but I am trying to do my best and go by the rota.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900028#CC00700","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1349798400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>My point is that if there is no Member from one Opposition group present a speaker from another Opposition group should be called.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900028#CC00800","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1349798400,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Senator Reilly has been present for the entire debate and perhaps we should allow ladies go first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900028#CC00900","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1349798400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I do not mind but it is worth making the point that the Opposition speakers would follow the Government speakers if the Government-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900028#CC01000","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1349798400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I call Senator Reilly who has eight minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900028#CC01100","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1349798400,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I hope not to take up that much time.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He is a regular visitor here and we are discussing an important topic.  As many other Senators have said, small and medium businesses, SMEs, are the lifeblood of the economy and upon them hinge jobs and the fate of the local economy.  That is an interlinked cycle in that when one suffers, everyone suffers and it is important, therefore, that we facilitate and foster their growth as much as possible.<\/p><p>We frequently hear reports that paint a clear picture of banks not lending to SMEs.  That must change because the SME sector will be allowed play its part fully in restarting economic growth here, especially when we consider that the State owns most of the banks in the State.  As the major shareholder in those banks we must try to do more to compel them to start engaging in greater lending to SMEs not just in theory but on paper because that is not trickling down to the people affected.  The soft approach to date has not worked.  We must take a harder approach and make sure that for SMEs the Government is seen to be fighting their corner because local economies and job creation hinge upon their success.<\/p><p>Another critical issue that has been raised with me is the vacuum and the uncertainty around county enterprise boards.  SMEs, and smaller businesses in particular, do not know where to go for advice and assistance.  We need more clarity on local enterprise offices, LEOs, their budget and the scope of their field of activity.<\/p><p>At the joint committee on jobs recently, Bernard Coyle of the Irish Exporters Association raised the issue that plans to close the county enterprise boards without having a replacement in place was causing considerable inertia in the system and companies were paying for that.  That legislation must be prioritised and put in place as soon as possible, particularly when we consider the fourth guiding principle of the EU Act noted by the Minister in his contribution.  <\/p><p>We have heard the mantra that the Government does not create jobs.  Over 33,000 jobs have been lost in the economy.  The vast majority of work found is in the SME sector, and Central Statistics Office figures demonstrate that 80% of all employment is within the SME sector.  A Government sponsored report found that 2,200 new businesses start up every month, and we know that at the same time there are approximately 1,400 business closures every month based on current trends.  The start-up phase is when companies need the greatest levels of support, and that is the reason the county enterprise boards and bank lending are important.<\/p><p>I commend entrepreneurs and start-up companies who take the plunge and set up their own business, especially in this economic climate.  I was fortunate to meet a start-up entrepreneur on Monday who set up the Blackbird caf\u00e9 in Derrylin, County Fermanagh, which is doing very well so far.  I hope that trend continues.  I commend people who take that plunge in this climate because it is a very brave move.<\/p><p>A host of specific issues arise upon which the Government must act if it is to play its role in facilitating SMEs in helping to get Ireland back to work.<\/p> <p> On Friday I was fortunate enough, as a Border county representative, to attend a conference that was jointly hosted by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht and its corresponding committee in the Assembly.  The debate was on difficulties with planning issues in Border towns and town centres.  The main issue was the displacement by multinational corporations of town centre businesses which are largely SMEs.  The question asked was how they can be sanctioned when there is no demonstrable need for developments of such scale, especially when there are large vacancy rates in towns because SMEs are going out of business.  In a large number of cases planning is granted for commercial reasons and for the immediate bounty that they bring to cash-strapped local authorities.  The point was raised that every \u20ac100 spent locally injects \u20ac250 into the local economy whereas the same amount spent in a multiple only injects \u20ac140 into the local economy.  Can the Minister of State tell me if he or his Department plan to enhance and support the town centre experience where many SMEs are based?  For example, if footfall is diverted from a town centre it removes a lot of business from SMEs, and that is across the spectrum whether that is retail or any kind of sector.  How can we collectively enhance the retail and social experience of towns?  Will the Government develop a plan similar to the Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association, NIIRTA, which produced a 50-point plan for redeveloping or regenerating town centres?    <\/p><p>We need to have a greater conversation with the Minister and his Department on SMEs and town centres and how to support SMEs in a dwindling town centre environment.  Such a debate would naturally follow the work done by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  <\/p><p>I cannot talk about the local domestic economy and SMEs without mentioning shrinking domestic demand and the effects of austerity policies.  A reduction in incomes, flat taxes such as household taxes and VAT hikes have led to a decreased domestic demand among consumers because people are afraid to spend their money.  That correlates with SMEs struggling to survive because some of the Government's policies have mitigated against them.  To return to what I said at the beginning, job creation hinges on SMEs, the domestic economy and a consumer's willingness to spend.  In a previous Private Members' motion, the Sinn F\u00e9in Party tabled changes that should be implemented and that we think could help SMEs in the current economic climate.  One example is ending an upwards-only rent regime for existing contracts.  The Government gave such a commitment in the programme for Government and there were problems with existing contracts.  We need to ensure that such contracts do not hinder SMEs.<\/p><p>We should also address the difficulties caused by late payment for those contracted to provide goods and services to the public sector, including NAMA. We should also open up the rules on tendering and procurement and develop clauses in public procurement contracts to promote the sourcing of local goods and services and provide training.<\/p><p>Another important measure would be the provision of greater levels of social protection, including protection in the case of illness for those who are self-employed.  Entrepreneurs have taken the plunge but they are afraid of what will happen if their business fails and worry whether they will be adequately protected by the social protection system.  We do not want them to suffer a collapse in income because they tried to create jobs in their local economy.  We need to ensure that there is a safety net for them.<\/p><p>With regard to local authority rates, we should introduce of a more progressive rates system whereby a larger and more profitable - typically a multinational business - pay a fairer portion of rates to alleviate the burden placed on mainly indigenous SMEs.  We should also enable company directors to invest money from their private pension funds in their businesses.  <\/p><p>I have a brief question on the Minister of State's speech when he mentioned the second guiding principle which states: &quot;Ensure that honest entrepreneurs who have faced bankruptcy quickly get a second chance.&quot;  What is the definition of &quot;honest entrepreneurs&quot;?  How is the measure governed and monitored?  How will the measure be applied in reality?  I ask him to make sure that people do get a second chance.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900028#CC01200","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349799000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I call Senator Michael Mullins who has eight minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900029#DD00200","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1349799300,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his comprehensive speech which comes during European SME week.  It is a great opportunity to provide information to businesses and potential start-up organisations on what supports are on offer to small and medium-sized businesses.  It is an opportunity to promote entrepreneurship and particularly to encourage young people to consider starting small businesses that will give employment to themselves and possibly one or two others.  It is also an opportunity to give recognition to the many fine entrepreneurs who have kept small businesses afloat in very difficult times.  The Minister of State has great experience in the small business sector and is doing a fine job in helping to promote small businesses in his job as Minister of State.<\/p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs 2012, which identified 270 actions across 15 Departments and 36 agencies, is making some contribution to make it easier for companies to start up or expand thereby encouraging exports and job creation.  Small business is pleased that the Government is in the process of overhauling five employment rights quangos which should be complete in 2013.  I welcome the reform of the city and county enterprise boards, involving the local authorities in job creation.  The comprehensive legislative programme, with the enactment of the Companies (Amendment) Act and the Competition (Amendment) Act, the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act, the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act and the Credit Guarantee Act, has been a significant contribution in helping small businesses.<\/p><p>The major question of finance has come up again today.  We all come across that issue in our constituencies on a daily basis.  The recent report of the Credit Review Office, which was mentioned on the Order of Business, certainly tells the full story.  Small and in many cases successful businesses are not in a position to get money from banks.  I will give one example from my county, Galway.  Bill Madden Nursery has been in business since 1833 and is very successful in landscaping, and retail and wholesale nursery.  It had reached the end of the road when it sent its application to the Credit Review Office.  It could have gone under with a significant loss of jobs.  It stated that it found that the people at the Credit Review Office were very helpful, professional and understanding, and gave valuable advice.  The outcome of the review gave a new lease of life to the nursery allowed it to keep the jobs in place and continue in business.  The review made the company's bank sit up and take its business seriously.  The nursery would strongly recommend the process to other businesses that have not done so already.  We need to send the message that if people are not happy with what they are hearing from their banks they should approach the Credit Review Office.  It is very significant that 100 businesses are still in place employing 8,500 people.<\/p><p>Two small shopkeepers in my town, Ballinasloe, who are under pressure but are keeping legitimate businesses going, told me in the past week that the banks are treating them like criminals, which is not right.  In one case a company employing 16 people needed \u20ac200,000 to keep afloat.  It had \u20ac1 million worth of orders up to Christmas, yet the bank pulled the plug.  That is not right and the banking system is not helping the lifeblood of the country - small and medium-sized businesses.<\/p> <p>When we sort out our financial situation, other issues will need to be addressed, including the complexity of regulation and licensing in this country.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, gave an undertaking to reduce the level of bureaucracy and red tape by 25% by the end of this year.  There is a great deal more to do in this area.  We need to put in place a system that makes it easier for people to start up or continue in business.  <\/p><p>The sick pay proposals were mentioned.  There is great concern among the small and medium-sized enterprise sector in regard to the proposal that they bear the cost of sick pay.  I urge the Minister of State to remain in close contact with his Cabinet colleagues on this issue.  Another issue of concern for small businesses is that of commercial rates.  An overhaul of the rates system is required.  I believe that rates should be linked to turnover, ability to pay or profitability.  There needs to be some sort of flexibility in this area.  A one-size-fits-all situation does not work in the current economic climate.  Small businesses expect and need better value for money from local authorities in terms of water and service charges.  There is much work to do in this area.  <\/p><p>Another issue for small businesses is the difficulties they are experiencing in obtaining payment for services rendered or goods delivered.  Many companies are experiencing great difficulties in this regard, despite the legislation in place.  Another bone of contention is, as mentioned by Senator Barrett, the issue of unfair competition.  The hotel and hospitality industry is finding competing with NAMA properties an issue.  This matter also needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>On the black economy, small businesses are under pressure from cash operated businesses, including people drawing social welfare benefits and operating small businesses.  Many of these businesses are operating in competition with legitimate businesses that are paying their taxes and charges, which is unfair.  There are many illegal activities in this area which also need to be addressed, including the sale of smuggled goods and diesel laundering, with which small shops cannot compete.  <\/p><p>Senator Reilly referred to self-employed people whose businesses run into financial difficulty, leaving them unemployed.  It is grossly unfair that people who have given stable employment in good times and have helped the State are not helped through difficult periods.  The social welfare system needs to be adjusted to take account of this situation.  I would ask that the Minister of State take this on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900030#EE00100","speaker":"1118","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349799600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>On the speaking order, I am reminded of a call I made previously for the abolition of the second group of Independents in this House.  It is an issue which I intend to raise on the Order of Business.  It makes a laughing stock of the Seanad that we have two separate groups of Independents and when one of them does not turn up the speaking arrangements for the day are upset.<\/p><p>I wish to raise a number of issues, the first of which is that of card and merchant acquiring services for small and medium sized enterprises.  I had lunch yesterday in Navan.  When I tried to pay for it with my Visa debit card, which is a convenient mechanism, the shopkeeper was unable to accept it but happily agreed to waiting for payment until after I had eaten my lunch and obtained money from the ATM.  The man concerned told me he cannot afford to have the required machine in his premises.  The same applies to other small businesses such as dry cleaners, barber shops and so on that do not have high turnover in terms of sales.  Pharmacies often have them because there is a high cash value on purchases therein.  This issue is causing huge problems for small businesses.  It will become an even greater problem with the introduction of swipe cards - my wife has one and has used it already - which do not require people when paying in certain outlets for goods costing less than \u20ac15 to enter a pin number.  While the availability of this service as a matter of practice in, say, Tesco or some of the multiples will be extremely convenient, the increasing move to a cashless society will be inconvenient for small businesses. <\/p><p>If the Government cannot force the banks to lend to small businesses it will have to put in place some arrangement at little or no cost to enable small shops to carry out commerce.  Small shops cannot do business if people do not use cash.  People are using cards more and will soon be using their iPhones to make purchases.  If we do not come up with a system which addresses this issue, people will avoid small shops and go to the multiples where they can use their cards, which is much more convenient for them.  I suspect this is already happening.  One can purchase a coffee in Navan, Slane or Kells with cash or one can go to Supermacs and purchase one using one's Visa card, which is more convenient.  Supermacs has the power in the marketplace to offer this service, in respect of which I believe the charges, in terms of commission, are exorbitant.  The delay in payment from banks or merchant acquirers to the shops would also be an issue for small shops, as they could not afford to wait for the money to come through.  There is a need for serious action in this regard.  People will of necessity avoid the shops which do not provide this service, resulting in their closure.  Whomever tackles this issue will be the hero of the many small businesses on whom we depend, including dry cleaners, barber shops, coffee shops, sandwich bars, hairdressers and pubs in rural Ireland.  It is increasingly the case, when one tries to pay for drinks in a pub where one may be attending a meeting and has no cash to do so, that they do not accept payment by debit card.  This is particularly true in respect of pubs located outside towns.  They, too, will be at a disadvantage because this new service is too expensive for them to offer.  Addressing this issue will be a plus for small businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900031#FF00300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1349799600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I will also confine my contribution to the disorder of the banking sector.  I recently wrote to the CEO of Permanent TSB following representations to me by constituents who have banked with TSB all their lives and wished to branch into business.  The people concerned were informed two days after visiting the bank to open a business account that they could not do so and were encouraged to take their business to the two pillar banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland.<\/p><p>  The following is the reply I received from the CEO, Mr. Jeremy Masding:<ul>While we continue to serve existing business customers I can confirm that since May of this year Permanent TSB no longer offers the service of opening new business accounts.  A decision was made by the executive board that personal financial services would be the clear focus of the bank.  <\/ul>This bank, which was bailed out by the taxpayer to the tune of &#8364;4 billion, is not working for the people, which is very upsetting.  The question that needs to be asked is whether this is a wind down of Permanent TSB.  One of the constituents told me he initially sought an overdraft facility to open his business and was told very quickly he would not get it.  When he tried to open a separate account, this was not possible.<\/p> <p>What surprised me most about the response was that a CEO had told the truth, because when one listens to others from the Irish Banking Federation one assumes they mean exactly the opposite to what they say.<\/p><p> If the proposals on the cost of sick leave to the employer were to be introduced in the budget it would have detrimental effects.  Page 4 of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>yesterday contained a story about an employer who had received a sick note from an employee to cover a nine-day period, but when the employer was at the airport on the eighth day covered by the sick note he met the employee returning from eastern Europe where she had been on holiday to attend a wedding.  The practice of giving such sick notes must be investigated the Medical Council or GPs in general.  Such availability of sick notes is a big question.<\/p><p> A very important debate on rateable valuations will be held in the House on Thursday and I hope as many Members as possible will contribute.  Rateable valuations are based on the square footage of a premises and the best achievable rent.  People have an idea that if one has a massive building one will pay massive rates, but the best achievable rent on the property is also taken into account.  I know of a man who recently started a business who is paying less than half of the rent paid on the same premises four years ago.  However, the rates have remained the same.  A supermarket could be 3,500 sq. ft. or 4,500 sq. ft. but any professional such as a solicitor, accountant, dentist or undertaker could have a much higher turnover.  If an undertaker has three burials a week this would mean 150 in the year and we know how much a funeral costs.  However, the rates on the undertaker's property will be lower than that on the supermarket which employs 20 or 25 people.  There is a mismatch and the entire issue should be thrown on the table and a more efficient, accessible and user-friendly approach should be found.<\/p><p> We must get a grip on this as it is blocking many people.  Many people have told me they have a great idea for a business and would love to start but will not even contemplate it because of the red tape and the costs involved.  These are the people we must try to harness and get involved in business and give them a leg up.  I believe that in Northern Ireland a rates rebate is available for the first 12 months for start-up businesses.  Let us use a small amount of imagination.  Perhaps such a measure would push the boat out, but I suggest providing it to a new business which would not affect another similar business in the community because such people must be enticed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900031#FF00400","speaker":"1163","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349800200,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to hear our views on the SME sector in Ireland and what we think should be done to ensure the sector becomes the engine room of Ireland's recovery.  It is a suitable portfolio for the Minister of State given his background and I commend him on all the work he has done in the area thus far.  This issue has been widely discussed in the past by my Labour Party colleagues and I, and we feel strongly about addressing some of the situations already mentioned in the debate.  Earlier this year we tabled a motion in the House to seek business supports for the sector.  In this regard I commend my party colleagues and all Senators who contributed to that debate.  We need foresight and unanimity to make any real progression in the sector.<\/p><p>I want to make clear I have a special affiliation with the SME sector as my parents own small enterprises in Athenry, County Galway.  They are no different to any other business owners in the country who operate in small towns and do their best, employing people and helping to generate economic activity.  They helped Ireland during the recession in the 1980s and the sector is trying to do the same thing in these times in very difficult circumstances.  However, there is a fundamental difference between the 1980s in small-town Ireland and now.  While people did not have huge turnovers in their businesses in the 1980s it is also true to say they did not have significant borrowings either.  However, in the recent past business people fell victim to the aggressive marketing of banks, the lax application of banking regulations and no governmental intervention at the time.  As a consequence they are now playing roulette with their livelihoods.<\/p><p>In my home town of Athenry more than 30 commercial units in the middle of the town are vacant.  As a result there is no significant economic activity, no jobs are being created and there is no buzz in the place.  Instead it is a satellite town and it is harrowing when I compare it to the time of my childhood.  Athenry is by no means unique and this is indicative of what is happening throughout the country.<\/p><p>We must identify the crux of the problem and I wish to highlight the utterly negative situation in the country.  Now more than ever we need those with an entrepreneurial spark and verve to feel encouraged to follow their business dream.  The current situation in the banking industry is counter-productive in that some are effectively not operational as banks.  Individuals with good credit histories have contacted me because when they sought loans to buy properties they were offered between 50% to 70% of the loan to value and in one instance the person was told the bank was not really lending and asked to return the following year when it would be in the market for loans.  This is incredible.  These are the same banks which were bailed out by taxpayers, the very people who cannot now get access to finance to help restart the economy.  Irish banks must realise they must play their part in the recovery and adopt some patriotic initiative in this regard.<\/p><p>Perhaps I will not convince anyone with what I have said about my experience in the constituency, but the statistics tell their own story.  Irish SMEs have a loan rejection rate second only to Greece in the eurozone at 24% of loan applications.  Correspondingly, it is important to point out that the average rejection rate in the 17 member countries of the single currency area is 12%.  This makes it twice as difficult for the sector to get finance in Ireland as it is elsewhere in the European Union.  Not only this, Ireland can also perversely boast of having the second highest level of discouraged borrowers, which means firms do not apply for loans even though they may need credit and, in any case, if they are lucky enough to secure a loan, the terms and conditions applied to new credit in Ireland are among some of the worst in the EU.<\/p><p>What is more perturbing is that recently the Credit Review Office received a number of eligible applications from SMEs which had been refused credit by AIB and Bank of Ireland, the two pillar banks.  Of the 21 cases completed in the quarter, 14 bank refusals were overturned resulting in the two banks subsequently supplying \u20ac1.18 million of credit supporting a further 106 full and part-time jobs in the SME sector.  Lending to non-financial non-property related SMEs by Irish resident credit institutions reduced by \u20ac390 million over the second quarter of this year and by \u20ac1.2 billion over the year to the end of June.  This follows an annual decline of 6.3% in the year to the end of March 2012.<\/p><p>If the banks are reluctant to reverse their current rule of thumb and associated trends then I respectfully ask that the Minister of State establish a special working group in conjunction with the Department of Finance to explore the possibility and feasibility of providing similar loan to value arrangements for the SME sector as that available to residential mortgage customers.  Acquiring 92% finance for commercial properties would make a huge difference to those seeking loans in that they would not be left with a cliff to climb to make their business dreams a reality.  Mortgages of 92% for commercial properties would give a timely boost to the SME sector which, in turn, would allow new businesses open and thus generate economic activity in small rural towns.<\/p><p>It makes sense to buy property now given the massive correction in the market, and all that is stopping us from kick-starting this are the banks.  If they are reluctant and dismissive of such approaches then it may very well be time for the Government to examine the establishment of banks similar to the former ICC and ACC which targeted the important sectors in Irish business as a way of generating economic growth.  Ireland needs answers and solutions and we do not need excuses.  Let us also look at the huge stock in NAMA's possession.  NAMA should be required to publish a full and detailed list of all property currently on its books and indicate the market prices of these properties.  Having property in its custody on behalf of the taxpayer and incurring security and maintenance costs associated with them is a fruitless exercise and does not make financial sense.<\/p> <p>As a way of countenancing the lack of lending to those who want to start up a business, NAMA needs to explore the possibility of providing rent-to-buy deals.  I fail to see how it can lose.  It would be a win-win scenario for all concerned.  It would solve a huge headache for NAMA in terms of associated property costs and a huge problem for individuals seeking to set up their own businesses as it would give them the opportunity to prove to the mainstream banks that they are capable of financing any such loan as they will be paying rent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900032#GG00200","speaker":"1173","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349800800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>There are a few speakers I must accommodate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900033#HH00200","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1349800800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I will conclude shortly.  The Government will win as it would bring some much-needed funds into the Exchequer while stimulating the SME sector.  I commend the Government on the steps taken with regard to the action plan for jobs, the school building programme, the capital spending on infrastructure announced in the July stimulus plan and the micro-finance fund which was recently announced.  However, let us look further than this.  The current market perception of the Irish economy means that it is unlikely that any significant new banking players will enter in the near future.  The resulting competition among the few can only result in continuous paralysis.  Without a working banking system, we will not be able to rebuild Ireland.  We must recognise how critical the role of SMEs is for economic development and do everything to address the conditions inflicted upon them.  For that reason, I urge the Minister of State to earnestly consider all the proposals made here today.  I thank the Minister of State and the Acting Chairman for his indulgence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900033#HH00300","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1349800800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Only for the fact that the Senator is my constituency colleague, I would have cut her off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900033#HH00400","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1349800800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I welcome my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Perry and, as I have done in the past, wish him continued success in his very challenging position.  It is not one that can always deliver on aspirations in these  difficult times.  I know the Minister of State's business background has prepared and equipped him very well for the job in hand.<\/p><p>Two reports published in the past week are of some significance.  One was the Central Bank report which indicated that we are still, despite our best efforts, not competitive with our trading partners.  In light of the fact that there is a difference of some 10% between Irish labour costs and those of our trading partners, the Central Bank in its report did not quantify and specify the areas in which this 10% differential existed.  I am not sure if the Minister has any information but it seemed that one boot was thrown out and one is now waiting for the second one to fall.  The report was somewhat flawed in that it did not specify the areas.  That would have been helpful.  There has been no follow-up or response from the Central Bank since last week about what areas of the economy contain this 10% differential.  It is clear there are some areas where the competitive differential is much lower.  It would be helpful to the Minister of the State and the Government if there was an awareness of the sectors that need to be addressed.  The Minister of State may have some comments to make in that respect.  <\/p><p>The other report was the IMF report, which was published this morning and received some airing in both Houses.  It said the IMF had underestimated the impact of austerity policies in Ireland.  This is significant coming from a group of people who, when it was first mooted would be coming to Ireland as part of the troika, were greeted as if it was Dracula descending on the country.  This was because, traditionally, the IMF had nearly bankrupted Third World countries because of the very stringent fiscal policies it imposed on those unfortunate countries.  However, it turned out to be much more benign and if one looks at the three entities in the troika - the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the IMF - the IMF have come out as the angels in all of this.  It is the entity that has pulled the other two back from imposing further austerity on the people.<\/p><p>I would be interested in hearing the Minister of State's comments on this in the context of his brief.  The inference from the IMF report is that not only this Administration but the previous one got it wrong.  We must remember that the recession started in 2008 and the first of the fiscal austerity budgets was introduced following 2008.  The amount of money pulled out of the Irish economy over those four years is of the order of \u20ac25 billion, which is an extraordinary sum of money.  It would be interesting if the Minister of State had some comment to make in the context of that report.  I do not expect that it will mean a change of direction in Irish fiscal policy but I am sure there will be some discussion around the Cabinet table.  <\/p><p>I wish to bring two areas to the attention of the Minister of State.  There are reports circulating in the UK that legislation is being prepared that would impose a \u00a3100 levy on all commercial traffic going into and out of the UK.  If that was to be implemented in law, it would be the death knell for many transport companies that are already put to the pin of their collar because of rising costs.  I am not sure if the Minister of State is aware of this because I had it checked out as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications last year.  The information I received was that it is only at proposal stage and is not yet drafted in legislation.  Again, it is something the Minister of State should watch out for because it impacts on small and medium-sized enterprises.<\/p><p>Linked to this would the Minister of State support the view that our fuel costs have risen to such an unacceptable level that they are now directly affecting jobs in the transport and haulage market and the wider economy?  I know we have no money and are a bust flush but sometimes in a budget, the Minister for Finance comes up with one or two innovative schemes that stimulate a particular area of the economy.  It all about targeting resources but I make the plea that serious consideration be given to reducing the burden of fuel costs on the Irish economy and specifically on the transport and SME sectors.  Even if it was only to be a few cent, the psychological impact of that would be a stimulus rather than impacting adversely on the overall budgetary situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900033#HH00500","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1349800800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Ar dt\u00fas, ba mhaith liom f\u00e1ilte a chur roimh an Aire St\u00e1it ar ais go dt\u00ed an Seanad.  As the Minister of State stated, small businesses are a central part of our economy and play a vital role in society and our local communities.  The Government is clear that it is critical to put SMEs at the centre of our thinking in driving the economic recovery.  They have played and will play a significant part in this economic recovery.  The ability of SMEs to succeed and grow underpins our future potential for jobs, growth and prosperity.<\/p><p>The Government is focused on ensuring that Irish companies are supported in every way to develop their business, increase exports, create jobs and rebuild the economy.  SMEs do not get the recognition they deserve.  There are approximately 200,000 SMEs throughout the country.  These are local people by and large, working and sustaining their own communities.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 published earlier this year clearly shows the Government's commitment in this area.  Many of the actions which the Government is pursuing through the action plan are aimed at improving Ireland's overall competitiveness by reducing costs and ensuring the enterprise environment is supportive of those companies which can sustain and create jobs.  The action plan shows the Government's commitment to implement change and reform in a step-by-step approach to re-energise the economy and meet the challenges of recovery.  The plan can and must succeed.<\/p><p>In addition to work under the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, the Government is also delivering on the findings of the advisory group on small business.  The advisory group, which is chaired by the Minister of State, published a report entitled The Voice of Small Business in November 2011.  We are committed to redoubling our efforts in the coming year and in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 to ensure that we deliver all possible support to businesses and relieve as much pressure as possible from businesses at this difficult time.  <\/p><p>I am also encouraged by a number of recent significant job announcements which show an increased level of confidence from investors in the economy and Government policies.  Many Senators today have welcomed the announcement by the Kerry Group, which must be welcomed by us all.<\/p> <p> By far the most talked about problem facing SMEs recently is the unavailability of adequate credit facilities.  Many Senators have mentioned this.  We all know access to finance is a key issue for small businesses and that it is critical to their long-term economic success.  There are still problems receiving finance, as stated by many Senators.  The action plan for jobs identifies the temporary partial loan guarantee scheme and the microfinance fund as two further actions to address the issue.  Both of these schemes are designed to assist companies that have been refused credit by the banks because they are deemed to be a high risk.  Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on how successful these schemes have been to date.<\/p><p>Microfinance Ireland was launched to assist SMEs and ensure supports are in place to encourage people to start out on their own and shape their own futures.  The microfinance loan fund is designed to stimulate lending to sustainable micro-enterprises and it is targeted at start-ups, newly established companies or growing micro-enterprises employing not more than ten people and it applies across all industrial sectors.  It will provide loans of up to \u20ac25,000 for commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial banks.  Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on how successful the microfinance scheme has been.<\/p><p>Many small businesses, having played an important role, have gone to the wall, unfortunately through no fault of their own.  The owners, as with the employees, have fallen on hard times.  They have made an impassioned plea to many of us in this House and the Lower House for welfare supports equal to those received by PAYE employees.  They have families and mortgages and children going to school and college.  Theirs is a valid argument.  Why should the self-employed who fall on hard times not be entitled to the same supports as others?  That they are not makes no sense to me.  Why should one lose out simply because one was self-employed?<\/p><p>Many business owners will argue they are the backbone of the economy, and that a successful recovery goes hand in hand with a buoyant SME sector.  I agree totally with them.  The low rate of absenteeism in the SME sector in Ireland has been commended across the Continent.  At approximately five days per worker per annum, it is close to the very best performance in Europe.  The sector must be commended on this.<\/p><p>A significant issue for start-up businesses is their having to pay outstanding rates left unpaid by the previous occupier of their premises.  As Senator Sheahan said, there should be a rates remission for the first year and the outstanding rates should be parked.  The rates should be paid on a deferred-payment basis, or otherwise, and everything ought to be done to encourage the start-up company.  In the past ten days, two major concerns have been drawn to my attention.  These are bank lending and outstanding rates in premises.  Something must be done in this regard, through the county managers, for example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900033#HH00600","speaker":"1138","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349801400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  This is probably one of our most important debates because small businesses are the lifeblood of the country.  European SME week begins on 17 October, and we are discussing the SME sector with this in view.  The theme of the conference on SMEs in Brussels will be \"Women's Entrepreneurship\".  This is very appropriate given that there has been discourse nationally and internationally this year on women's representation on company boards.  In this regard, we should consider the new EU legislation to which Ireland will be party.  In the coming months, the European Commission is expected to publish a draft proposal aimed at addressing gender imbalance on company boards in EU countries.<\/p><p>A report this year from the international law firm Eversheds found that having women on a company board has a positive impact on the company's share price performance.  This will be evident to one if one checks the results of the companies associated with the FTSE 100 or FTSE 300.  This is outlined in the Lord Davies report and the Eversheds report this year.<\/p><p>Small businesses are and should be given priority, as is the case under the current Government.  This is evident from the action plan announced earlier in the year.  There are SMEs in every town and village and they form the majority of businesses across the State, be it in manufacturing or be they associated with foreign direct investment.  Growth in the SME sector will lift the country out of its current difficulties.<\/p><p>I had intended to mention rates but they have been mentioned by other Senators.  I will not dwell on the matter; suffice it to say that something must be done for new start-ups.  I was at a meeting recently in Northern Ireland and noted what is done for start-ups in respect of rates.  New businesses are not displaced because rates reliefs are offered to new businesses that are not on the street.  This was raised when this matter was first mooted.  In the North, there is a different regime pertaining to outstanding rates.  We learn by working together.  In the North, rates attach to the person and not the location.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this and determine how the system works in the North.  Perhaps we could do something along the same lines for small businesses here.<\/p><p>The main obstacle facing small businesses is access to credit, as stated by many Senators.  The banks are now totally risk averse.  They were too lenient during the period of the property bubble and now they have gone to the other extreme.  One must question this given the amount of taxpayers' money put into them.  Some 24%, or more, of all loan applications by new businesses have been rejected.  Something ought to be done in this regard.  As many Senators have mentioned this, I will not dwell on it.<\/p><p>Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on the performance of the temporary partial credit guarantee scheme in the third quarter.  What is the rate of progress?<\/p><p>The microfinance loan fund was mentioned by many Senators.  I will not dwell on this either.  Is it working as intended?  I acknowledge it is a new fund.  Microfinance Ireland is working closely with the county and city enterprise boards, which have been amalgamated into the local authorities.  Bearing in mind the link between the city and county enterprise boards and local authorities, is the Minister of State working with local authorities in other countries, such as Germany, with a view to assisting small Irish businesses with contacts in those countries?  Local authorities in other countries have little micro-enterprise hubs on which we could model ours and with which we could forge links.<\/p><p>I welcome the new business plan guidance as it is good.  Many businesses know what they want but are just not getting the funding they require.  The potential export division in Enterprise Ireland should be borne in mind in light of what I have said on local authorities and links with those in other countries.<\/p><p>Banks actually hold onto a small business's money when a transaction is made.  The client pays the money; it is left in the bank for three days and sometimes four, as has been reported to me, and then it is transferred out.  Why is this happening?  The Minister of State should ask the Financial Regulator whether there is a statutory period for the transfer of moneys from account A to account B?  If the transaction is the other way around, the bank is not slow in taking money from one's account.  It will take it and hold it.  The Minister of State should inquire into what is happening.  Many small businesses have brought this subject to my attention.<\/p><p>I must give credit where credit is due.  The report published yesterday by the Credit Review Office has shown that 98 cases were reviewed and overturned.  The banks should pull up their socks and ensure they take business seriously.  I compliment the Credit Review Office because 60% of the cases that have been examined have been overturned.  I hope this will make the banks pull up their socks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900034#JJ00200","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1349801400,"counter":172,"content":"<p>There was some very good debate and it will be very hard to respond to all of the points made.

This is an important week, given the high level of engagement by semi-State bodies and private companies.  Next week will focus on women in business and the trade and export culture.  There are many opportunities and personal contact is important.  When people make formal applications, banks are obliged to reply within 15 days.  A person can appeal to the bank before taking the matter to Mr. Trethowan's office.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett made an effective point regarding the ICC Bank model and suggested that a part of AIB be geared towards small enterprise.  That there is no competitive tendering in the transport sector needs to be examined.  The Senator also alluded to the role of the local enterprise offices, LEOs.

This is being delivered and is part of a process to make Ireland the best small country for business.  This is a major challenge, but the Government and our citizens are up to it.  We will recover our economic independence quickly.  Many of the plan's actions are aimed at improving Ireland's overall competitiveness, reducing costs and ensuring an enterprising environment.  Equally, the jobs plan for 2012 is delivering on the findings of the advisory group.  We are committed to redoubling our efforts.  The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs will deliver all possible supports to business and relieve as much pressure on them as is possible at this difficult time.<\/p><p>The unavailability of adequate credit facilities has been the most discussed problem of recent times.  This problem faces the small business sector and needs to be addressed.  The various initiatives taken by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to restructure and recapitalise the banking system has been the Government's principal response in this regard.<\/p><p>A temporary partial loan guarantee is being drafted.  A plan will also be put in place to tackle the uncertainty surrounding the timeframe concerning the enterprise boards.  They are open for business and are engaging.  The Bill will be published in the coming weeks.  Both of these schemes will be designed to assist companies.<\/p><p>Some weeks ago, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, launched the micro-finance fund, which has been a successful first step.  It will work in close collaboration with the LEOs.<\/p><p>The temporary partial loan guarantee will be closely targeted at commercially viable, well performing enterprises with solid business plans, defined markets for their products or services and sufficient collateral.<\/p><p>Micro and small businesses comprise a crucial part of the economy and ensuring that they expand and export is a key part of the plan for jobs.  For this reason, the Government has decided to implement an ambitious reform in the delivery of services to micro and small businesses, including a new micro and small business division within Enterprise Ireland, a centre of excellence in the provision of supports for small enterprise, the dissolution of the enterprise boards and the establishment of this office.<\/p><p>I am sorry that we do not have more time to go through all of the issues raised, but it is difficult to cover everything.  Small businesses are not just a vital part of the economy.  Rather, they play a vital role in our society.  Our future economic prosperity depends on a sustained, strong entrepreneurial spirit even in the face of unprecedented economic challenges.  The Government working group on regulation has been examining the question of cutting down on red tape.  The many initiatives under way are making a difference.  Companies have opportunities.  It is good to see fantastic companies are emerging daily and becoming successful.  I thank the House for its time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900034#JJ00300","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349802000,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900035#KK00200","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Radical Seanad Reform Through Legislative Change: Statements (Resumed)","time":1349802000,"counter":175,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900035#KK00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1349802000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I wish to make a number of brief points, one of which was raised in the report.  Since the 1937 Constitution, there have been ten reports on reform of the Seanad - I emphasise the word \"reform\" - but none has proposed abolition.  In the last significant report, the committee under the former Leader, Mrs. Mary O'Rourke, was pleasantly surprised that, of the 49 oral submissions and 161 written submissions, \"very few\" proposed abolition.  All proposed reform.  I hope that civic society will take on this challenge.<\/p> <p> When the arguments for and against the issue are being put before the people, as the referendum commission would be obliged to do if nobody else does it, the electorate on which this decision will rest should take account of the unprecedented majority enjoyed by Governments since the foundation of the State and the lack of any urgency in reforming the D\u00e1il, which must come with any reform of this House, irrespective of whether the discussion concerns abolition.  Reform is urgent, and reform of our political democracy and the manner in which we conduct our affairs in both Houses has come under increasing scrutiny, to the point where I believe the public is becoming apathetic to the political ethos.  That is very dangerous in a democracy, which is a fragile flower that must be worked on.<\/p><p>Listening to the Pat Kenny radio show this morning dealing with another book about Hitler, it emerged that in 1933, the German people decided to cast the majority of their vote for two parties which wanted to abolish democracy, the communists and national socialists, or Nazis.  This was partly because people had become disenchanted and disillusioned with the political establishment.  The German people listened to mob orators, like Hitler, who promised he would sweep away the political system and its parties.  The civilised German people, from the country of Goethe and other philosophers, voted for that megalomaniac.  I am not trying to raise the temperature of the debate but it is important to keep in mind that if there is an abolition of this House, it will be gone and not return.  Will there be a reform of the D\u00e1il?<\/p><p>I am appealing to the wider civic society rather than Senators, former Senators and the very distinguished group of people which has come together for this report, to take interest in the issue.  I hope those who are not Senators and who are not involved in the political system will take on this challenge when and if it arises and when the question is put before the people.  I would particularly focus my request to all the professional bodies which go to the trouble of registering on all five vocational panels each year, such is the importance they attach to the representational nature of this House.  If those people did not believe in the efficacy of this House or think it was worth it, they would not bother to register each year to ensure their professional organisation has the right to nominate a candidate for the Seanad elections.<\/p><p>I ask the dozens of professional bodies that when this battle is engaged - it will be a war to the death - they will be on the front line and in the trenches, ensuring that the experience they have had of dealing with the Seanad through the decades, and the manner in which their perspective has been articulated by a variety of Senators across all sides, will continue to be the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900035#KK00400","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349802600,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I congratulate the people who drafted the document, who came forward with some very positive proposals.  I have already made my views known on the issue and the need for us in the Seanad to be proactive in monitoring what is coming through from Europe.  I previously proposed that two days a month should be set aside to deal with European regulations and directives.  It is great that we have an eight-week period to discuss documents after they are drafted but it would be far better for us to be involved at an earlier stage in order that we could give our views then rather than when the process has been completed.  We must be able to monitor what is going on in Europe.<\/p><p>On the biggest complaint about Europe is that there is a disconnect between what is happening there compared to what happens at home, particularly regarding how decisions are made.  The two best examples I remember relate to fishing and mussel seed harvesting in Cromane in Kerry.  In that case the process had to stop because of an EU regulation which had been in place for some time.  The work that should have been done in order to allow the harvesting to continue was not done because people were not aware of the regulation.  The Government of the time got over \u20ac5 million in grant aid to carry out the various studies but it was never used and was returned to Europe.  Another significant issue in the west is turf cutting.  A regulation was in place for a long period before somebody decided that it needed to be followed through, and decisions were taken at that stage.  The directive had been in place for a while at this stage.  We should be able to use the Seanad to monitor European regulations at an early stage of gestation.<\/p><p>It is important that we consider how we do our business.  We must reflect on working together rather than separately, although I may not have the support of everybody on this issue.  I learned from my time in Brussels that all parties can sit around a table to try to work out a compromise taking on board the views of a maximum number of people.  We must do more of that.  Considering the draft legislation since the change of Government, some 149 Bills have been published, with 79 of those from the Government and 64 passed into law.  There have been 70 Bills from people in Fianna F\u00e1il, Sinn F\u00e9in and Independents.  The question arises of how many legislators we have in the 226 Oireachtas Members.  Is the number restricted to the Ministers or may all 226 Members become legislators?  We are so reliant on Departments to decide on legislation that input from people other than Ministers in both Houses is being reduced.  That is something we must take on board in considering the reform issue.<\/p><p>The decision has been made by the Fine Gael leader and the Taoiseach that there will be a referendum and we will stick by that decision.  We must have a detailed and honest debate about a third option.  If the proposal to abolish the Seanad is rejected by the electorate, which has the final say, we should have serious consideration of reform.  We must ensure that a full debate can take place, setting out the nature of possible reform.  It should not just be about the number of Members or how we do business but how Members are elected.  We should focus on that element, as the current structure of election is outdated and should be reviewed.<\/p> <p>I welcome this debate and the discussion document.  I hope it will be just one of many discussion documents that will be made available before the referendum is held.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900036#LL00200","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349803200,"counter":180,"content":"<p>F\u00e1ilt\u00edm roimh an deis mo thuairim\u00ed agus tuairim\u00ed Sinn F\u00e9in a thabhairt ar an tuairisc iontach sp\u00e9isi\u00fail agus iontach maith seo.

There are many points worthy of consideration in this document.  I will not go through all of them and I will try not to repeat the points other Senators have already highlighted, although I will note a few key points from my perspective.  <\/p><p>We are having this debate because, as the report notes on page 26 and as has been highlighted by previous reports on Seanad reform, the Chamber lacks a clear and distinctive role and is, in many respects, seen to be merely mimicking the D\u00e1il.  This is very much the case,  However, as this and numerous other reports have highlighted, and as my party has highlighted, there is an infinite number of purposes a second chamber could usefully fulfil and which would add to the political life of the State if only we were willing to consider them.  A number of these suggestions mirror those I have previously highlighted in this Chamber.  Point 8.4 on page 26 gives a considerable and persuasive exposition of the role the Seanad could undertake in scrutinising European legislation.  As a state, we have failed to really engage with this whole process and I note Senator Colm Burke also alluded to this.  <\/p><p>The fiasco surrounding the septic tanks issue and the turf cutting debacle shows what the costs can be when we do not have an eye to what legislation is passing through the EU and through these institutions as statutory instruments.  I welcome the new weekly update we get of legislation that is laid before the Houses.  There is a substantial amount of documentation every week, much of it from the EU, which we do not have time to debate in these Houses or for which time is not set aside and some of that needs to be debated and cross-checked.  <\/p><p>There is a value in the Seanad examining ordinary legislation.  This report highlights that the Seanad has played a considerable part in improving legislation over the years, with point 5.4 highlighting examples where Seanad suggestions have later reappeared as Bills such as in the case of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011.  <\/p><p>The report also highlights the very obvious need to make the Seanad more democratic.  We have consistently made clear that we believe the Seanad in its current form is not acceptable.  This is due to its limited function and clearly because its manner of election is totally anti-democratic and elitist.  It is for that reason the public considers that its function is limited.  The report usefully highlights that even without constitutional reform we can make the elections to the Seanad more democratic by expanding the franchise and even to the point of providing for a substantial bulk of the Seanad to be directly elected.  There are many ways in which people could be elected, whether through the European constituencies, through a list-type system format or through the panels and assigning voters to panels.  However, clearly it is not appropriate to have a House of the Oireachtas where ordinary citizens do not have a vote.  Clearly, the Seanad is also a very appropriate place to provide representation to Irish citizens in the North and to the Diaspora.  It is very welcome that this point is being considered in the report and highlights that numerous bodies have made such suggestions.  These are categories of citizens who currently have no say in the political life of the State and that must be corrected.<\/p><p>I note the references to the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, the work of which I commend.  It could, however, be enhanced and made a relevant part of informing decision making in this Chamber.  People, ranging from ordinary citizens and lobby groups, have access to the Seanad that they will never have to the D\u00e1il and we should seek to ensure that this role is maximised to its fullest potential.  <\/p><p>I wish to make two final points.  Before the recess we had a debate on the inexplicable refusal to allow this issue to be referred to the constitutional convention.  Sinn F\u00e9in has consistently called for this inclusion.  In our discussions with the Taoiseach, my party leader and those members of my party who comprise our membership of the convention expressed clearly their view that the future of the Seanad had to be part of the convention.  It is an ideal opportunity and forum that can have the capability of considering the many different opinions and options which could be explored.<\/p><p>My final point is why such an option was not taken.  Pages 14 and 15 highlight the numerous reports which have been ignored.  They all highlighted the threat of abolition if the House was not reformed.  There is a body of work there which could be at least considered, including the work of the Constitutional Review Group and the Seanad \u00c9ireann committee, in which my colleague, Senator Cullinane, participated as a councillor.  There is no reason this could not be considered and acted upon at this time but the reality is that the Taoiseach has set his face against it.  I suspect many of his colleagues do not see the merit in such a foolhardy and pointless initiative as this one.  It is incredible that we may yet see the cutting off of a whole arm of the Oireachtas, the Parliament of the State, on the basis of throw-away remarks of the Taoiseach, which he has now become fixated on acting upon.  This is not the new politics we were all promised - it is scarcely politics at all.  The Government, particularly the Taoiseach, needs to step back and examine this issue with clarity, calmness and the proper regard for care in the reform of the Constitution and of the political institutions of the State.  It is clear that the constitutional convention is the appropriate forum for doing so and it should be referred to that body at the very least.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900037#MM00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1349803200,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I thank the Leader of the House for allowing this debate to continue again today.  I compliment Senators Quinn and Zappone and all others involved in drawing up this Radical Seanad Reform through Legislative Change consultation paper.  I congratulate both Senators on that and no doubt it was not done in one hour, one day or one night.<\/p><p>I acknowledge and compliment the expertise and professionalism of Members from all walks of life in the Seanad and that has an important part to play in the reforming of it.  A total of 11 previous reviews of the Seanad have taken place and a common denominator among them is that none of them called for the abolition of the Seanad.  Unfortunately, none was acted upon.  Reform was the common denominator among them.  Legislation must always be critically examined and, as stated by Senator Colm Burke, monitored at an early stage.  There must be a second House to do that.<\/p><p>I am one of the 42 new Members of the Seanad and for the first four or five months I asked myself what I was doing here and if I was here to listen to the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach or whoever was in the Chair being totally ignored by my fellow Senators.  Having been involved in a local authority for nearly 30 years and having chaired councils and regional bodies, I state categorically that I have never been involved in a forum where the words and rulings of the Cathaoirleach, or those of the Acting Chairman, on many occasions have not been listened to or adhered to.  We could begin by reforming ourselves by acting responsibly.  I have never interfered with the ruling of the Cathaoirleach - he may have intervened when I have spoken but I do not believe he has.  We should start reforming by becoming more mannerly in this House.  <\/p><p>I once again congratulate Senators Zappone and Quinn and those involved in drawing up this paper.<\/p> <p>It is a great starting point for all Members, which they must contemplate and consider.  On foot of the contributions made in this House by Senators Zappone and Quinn, I must state that as a new Senator, they are two of those to whom I listen each time they speak.  I congratulate them for this consultation paper and look forward to implementing and discussing many of the changes contained therein.  A great point has been made in respect of the question of costs for the Seanad and for the spiritual advisers to Ministers.  I note we are running neck and neck and ask whether there is better value for money from the Seanad than from some spiritual advisers to Ministers, who as far as I am concerned are in receipt of extraordinary and unbelievable salaries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900037#MM00300","speaker":"1138","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of Seanad","time":1349803800,"counter":183,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900038#NN00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1349803800,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I call on the acting Leader, Senator Colm Burke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900038#NN00300","speaker":"1152"},{"type":"speech","time":1349803800,"counter":185,"content":"<p>As Senator Zappone's group brought forward this debate, I propose an amendment to give them the right to reply and to allow them five minutes in which to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900038#NN00400","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1349803800,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I again thank the Leader for making available this time to respond to our document, \"Open it, Don't Close It: Radical Seanad Reform Through Legislative Change\", as well as to the wider issues of political reform to which it points.  I thank the Leader for his request that I respond to all Members' contributions and will begin by thanking them for the highly thoughtful contributions by each Member, as well as their attentiveness to the document.  It is a great support to Senator Quinn and me in respect of what we are attempting to do.  Senator Quinn and I both agree with the Leader and with most of our colleagues that it is absolutely appropriate to discuss radical reform here in the Seanad and that our focus has been on the reform of the political system, as quite distinct from Senators with vested interests arguing for the retention of their, or our, jobs.  As Senator Keane observed in the first part of this debate, \"We are discussing the State and the country, the Seanad and the system of checks and balances.\"  Would anyone challenge D\u00e1il Deputies were they to debate political and D\u00e1il reform?  Would anyone argue their arguments were solely and only about keeping as many seats as possible for themselves and their colleagues?  Do the people not deserve that their public representatives take seriously the issues related to the institutions of governance and review critically how well the systems are working to ensure there does exist a genuine balance of powers in order that democracy is served?  Consequently, Senator Quinn and I consider it to be appropriate - I believe most Members have agreed - that this issue should be discussed in this Chamber.  This is much of what our document is about.  Moreover, I note, as did Senator Barrett in his earlier contribution, that in its origins, \"this House was shaped by a need to counter the stronghold of the Executive over the Legislature\".  Down through its history, as we argue in the document and as I have heard other Members observe, the Seanad has provided a system of checks and balances to the existence of political power.  Many Members referred to this issue in their contributions.  Senator Paul Coghlan, the Government Whip, spoke eloquently about it when he referred to the 75 references in the Constitution to the Seanad's role, particularly the safeguards the Seanad provides for the people and he asked whether the public would like to see such safeguards swept away.<\/p><p>I listened carefully to my colleagues in this House during both parts of this debate and I do not believe I heard a single Member argue for abolition.  I heard all of them argue for radical reform of Seanad \u00c9ireann.  I heard several of them, for example, Senators O'Donovan, Bradford and Crown, note that political reform is critical and urgent.  All the Senators, including Senator Colm Burke who spoke earlier today, stated this was urgent and that Members should be engaged in a debate on the D\u00e1il and the Executive, as well as the Seanad.  Senator Mooney also mentioned that point.  Senator O'Donovan called them the three anchors that hold together our system of democracy.  Senator Crown argued the entire process of government must be reformed.<\/p><p>I also listened carefully to the Leader, who outlined his agenda of reform of the Seanad, and to other Senators who suggested that such reform must continue, including the manner in which they behave in the Chamber, which I accept.  The Leader has instigated a number of innovations for reform.  He has sought further reform, such as the taking on by the Seanad of a more significant role with regard to the scrutiny of European legislation and Senator Colm Burke also has been central in this regard.  However, Members are aware that thus far, this particular reform has not been supported and one must ask why this is the case.<\/p><p>I heard no calls for abolition.  I heard several Members, including members of the Government parties, accept our evidence that the costs of the Seanad have been exaggerated and should not be used as an argument for its abolition.  I also heard the strenuous arguments of Senator Bradford that this House is worthy of retention, that Members must reflect on the need for radical change in tandem with the radical change in politics that is urgently required.  He then stated, &quot;Let us not be the whipping boys of those who are unwilling to reform their own House.&quot;  Nevertheless, I still have heard members of the Government parties state we should put this issue to the people to allow them to decide.  I am quite astounded by such arguments.  Those Members are in favour of radical reform, yet they state the people must be asked whether they want the Seanad to remain as it is or to be abolished.  Is it not the usual case that if a referendum is put to the people, the Government does a number of things?  First, it engages in an extended analysis of the intricacies of change as to why it is needed, what kind of specific change is sought and how it can fit with the various policies and laws that already are in place.  Is this not the example that currently is before-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900038#NN00700","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1349803800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>The Senator's time has elapsed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900038#NN00800","speaker":"1152"},{"type":"speech","time":1349803800,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I seek one or two more minutes.

I have approximately one minute left.  Is it not the case the Government does this in respect of referendums put to the people?  Is this not the case in respect of the forthcoming children's referendum?  Much analysis, committee meetings, reports, etc., went into the preparation of this referendum.  However, no such analysis and preparation have been undertaken by the Government in respect of the referendum promised on the Seanad.  Does this not go contrary to the careful, intelligent and responsible approach the Government has taken with regard to the children's referendum?  Does this not indeed go contrary to responsible governance and, furthermore, is it not usually the case that the Government puts something to the people in which it believes and for which it has made a case?<\/p><p>Instead, what I believe I am hearing from the Taoiseach, as well as from many Members of this House, is to let the people decide.  On the one hand, many Members have argued for reform but on the other, they are not putting reform to the people.  Does taking the route thus chosen by them constitute responsible government?  If such Members are in favour of reform, why do they not consider radical Seanad reform through legislation?  Our document makes proposals for such reform and with regard to a more democratic Seanad, we have outlined our preferences for a universal franchise for the panel seats.  The Leader has stated he is convinced the public will not support a Chamber for as long as they have no say in who is elected to it.  While I agree with him, the Leader then went on to state the matter, that is, how people are elected to the Seanad, &quot;will have to be agreed well in advance of any referendum&quot;.  This is precisely what our proposals have set out to do.  This is precisely the reason Senator Quinn and I have called for the Government to put aside its proposals for a referendum until this House and the Lower House have had a chance to debate a Bill that can bring about radical reform of the Seanad through legislation.  This would be the responsible and rational approach, after which Members could begin to have a proper debate, which the people deserve from their public representatives, on how to ensure the best possible way to use and to balance the public power that has been given to Members.  The urgency for reform is now and it will not be there after a referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900038#NN01200","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1349803800,"counter":194,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900038#NN01300","speaker":"1152"},{"type":"speech","time":1349803800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Ar 10.30 maidin amar\u00e1ch.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900038#NN01400","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Adjournment Matters","time":1349804400,"counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900039#OO00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Museum of Ireland","time":1349804400,"counter":197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900039#OO00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1349804400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>As this is the first time I have raised a matter on the Adjournment, forgive me if I get the procedures wrong.  I warmly welcome the Minister to the Seanad and extend my congratulations to him on securing approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to fill the post of director of the National Museum of Ireland.  I know how difficult it can be and I acknowledge the work of the Minister's dedicated and committed officials in securing this approval.<\/p><p>I raise this issue because I would like clarification on the role of the statutory board of the National Museum of Ireland in the selection and appointment of the new director.  The appointment of a director of the National Museum of Ireland needs the consent of the Minister, as per section 29(1) of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997.  The Minister debated in this House the Independent group's motion on the national cultural institutions and said on 27 June that the dismantling of the National Cultural Institutions Act was not in his plans.  The Minister's statement issued on 3 October last does not mention the role of the board of the National Museum of Ireland in the recruitment, selection or appointment of the director.  I note that the current chairman of the museum board, Dr. John O'Mahony, expressed his concern that there was no mention of the board anywhere in the Minister's statement on 3 October.<\/p><p>I understand, and heartily agree with, the process of open competition and it being managed by the Public Appointments Service, but the reason I raise this issue is to seek clarification that the Minister is not dismantling the 1997 Act by bypassing the statutory board in recruiting the director of the National Museum of Ireland.  Will the Minister clarify that the future employer of the new director of the museum will be the board of the National Museum of Ireland, as set out in the Act, and that the board will be involved in the recruitment and appointment of the new director with the Minister's consent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900039#OO00200","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1349804400,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to clarify the issues raised by the Senator.  In my response, I would like to be abundantly clear in regard to the issues which arose following the resignation of the previous director of the National Museum of Ireland, the steps which have been taken by my Department since that time and the process which is being followed regarding the appointment of a new director.<\/p><p>As the Senator pointed out, section 29(1) of the 1997 National Cultural Institutions Act provides for the appointment of a chief executive officer of the museum who shall be known as the director of the museum.  The roles and responsibilities which attach to the director post are many and are carried out under the direction and guidance of the board of the museum.  The 1997 Act provides that the director of the museum shall be appointed by the board of the museum with the consent of the Minister.  These provisions are set out very clearly in section 29 of the Act.<\/p><p>In late January this year, the then director of the national museum wrote to me to inform me of his decision to retire from his post from 29 February.  In his communication, the then director regretted the short notice of his intention to retire.  It is a fact that at this time there is in place a moratorium on appointments at all levels within the public sector.  Therefore, my Department had to seek approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to suspend the moratorium in the case of the director of the National Museum of Ireland and to fill the post.  The national museum had to make a case for the new appointment to be made and terms and conditions for the new appointment also had to be agreed.  While this process was under way, approval was sought and secured from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to appoint an acting director in the interim.<\/p><p>Following ongoing contact between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, last week the approval to proceed with the appointment of a new director at the National Museum of Ireland was secured.  I was pleased to advise the D\u00e1il of this development last Wednesday, 3 October, on which date I also wrote formally to the chair of the national museum.<\/p><p>An independent recruitment process to be managed by the Public Appointments Service will now commence to allow for the selection and recruitment of a suitably qualified candidate for this prestigious post.  Let me be absolutely clear - the recruitment process will be managed by the Public Appointments Service as the agent of the National Museum of Ireland.  The National Museum of Ireland, with my consent, is the appointment entity.  The timescale for completion of this recruitment process is a matter for the Public Appointments Service, but I am given to understand that the post of director will be advertised publicly in the coming weeks.  I hope that is the case, as I wish to see the new director in place as soon as possible, but I must again reiterate that this is an independent recruitment process managed by the Public Appointments Service.<\/p><p>The proposed recruitment process is similar to those employed in the recent recruitment of the current directors of a number of our other national cultural institutions, including the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the National Concert Hall.  All these appointments, and that of the director of the Arts Council, were made in this fashion, with the Public Appointments Service operating as the recruitment agency for the cultural institutions involved.<\/p><p>All of the appointments are made ultimately by the board of the relevant institution, with my consent, as provided for in statute.  This is the same situation as now arises in the case of the new director of the National Museum of Ireland.  Any attempt to portray the process of appointment of the new director of the National Museum of Ireland as somehow odd, unusual or atypical is simply wrong.<\/p><p>The facts of the matter are very simple.  To be abundantly clear, let me recap briefly on all steps in this process.  The former director of the National Museum of Ireland retired after short notice at the end of February.  I would like to recognise the work of Dr. Pat Wallace.  He was much committed to the National Museum of Ireland for a long time and I am delighted to say that his celebrated book on Wood Quay will be published next year.  That will, no doubt, be very important from the point of the commemoration of 1014 and Viking Dublin.<\/p><p>My Department sought and received approval for the board to appoint an acting director who has been in place since March.  Due to the moratorium in place on recruitment in the public service, an agreement had to be secured to suspend the moratorium in this case.  To this end, the museum board made a business case to my Department for the filling of the director post, in accordance with the process for addressing all vacancies in the public sector.<\/p> <p>Approval to fill the post was received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform last week and I announced the matter in the D\u00e1il in response to a parliamentary question.  The sanction to fill the post was also conveyed by me to the chairman of the National Museum of Ireland, and it now falls to the museum to liaise with the Public Appointments Service in relation to the advertising of the post, the recruitment campaign and so forth.  The terms, conditions and salary for the new director of the National Museum of Ireland, when appointed, will be the same as those which applied to the previous director.<\/p><p>I should mention the series of efficiency measures announced in the Government's public service reform plan last November which included proposals to examine the issue of shared services and the board structure of both the National Library and the National Museum.  A report outlining the progress to date and the proposed way forward in respect of these issues was forwarded to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in July and I am advised that this information is being assimilated with a view to it being submitted to Government for consideration in due course.<\/p><p>I hope that this clarifies the position for the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900039#OO00300","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349805000,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Yes, it does clarify the situation and I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900040#PP00200","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Staff","time":1349805000,"counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900040#PP00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1349805000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I understand the Minister is also taking the matter I have raised, which relates to the recruitment of junior doctors.<\/p><p>According to figures for 2011, there are 4,751 junior doctors employed in the Irish health system.  Of these, 1,703 are senior house officers, 546 are interns, 1,568 are registrars and 934 are senior registrar specialists.  We do not have a problem with senior registrar specialists, who are all on five year contracts.  However, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the contracts of senior house officers and registrars.<\/p><p>I did my own study of attitudes of final year medical students in 2012 and concluded that only 34.5% of graduates would be working in Irish hospitals 12 months after graduating from Irish universities.  Part of the reason for this is that junior doctors are offered contracts of six months or 12 months.  In Australia, New Zealand or the United Kingdom, doctors' contracts can be for two or three years.  The contracts may mean working in more than one hospital, but they give security of employment and the prospect of a planned programme of medical education.<\/p><p>How are we going to deal with this issue?  When the Government came to power in March 2011, the Minister for Health found there was a huge shortage of junior doctors, and the HSE had to go to India and Pakistan to recruit doctors.  All of the people brought in at that time were given two year contracts which will expire in July 2013.  We now need a plan to commence on 1 January 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900040#PP00300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1349805000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>The Minister for Health apologises for his non-availability this evening.  He has assured me that he will listen to the debate and respond to Senator Burke's question.<\/p><p>Against the background of shortages of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, in many countries, a number of recruitment and retention initiatives have been undertaken by the HSE in the past two years and, as a result, all essential hospital services have been maintained.  Given the central role that NCHDs play in the provision of hospital services, ensuring the necessary number and types of NCHDs are available to the service is a priority issue for the Minister for Health.<\/p><p>Since 2007 the HSE has increased the proportion of training posts from 40% of all NCHD posts to over 80%, all of whom are recruited by postgraduate training bodies for placement in hospitals and agencies.  The remaining 19% of posts not categorised as training posts, comprise a combination of posts occupied by doctors with contracts of indefinite duration and doctors who rotate regularly between different posts, some of whom have recently left or are hoping to rejoin training schemes.  Three quarters of these posts are in HSE hospitals and agencies with the balance in HSE funded agencies.<\/p><p>The standard six month duration of contract arises from the rotation of doctors between different posts as part of training schemes.  In cases where the relevant postgraduate training body does not fill a post, a vacancy arises to be filled by the HSE or HSE funded agency on a non-training basis.  The majority of such posts are at senior house officer, SHO, and registrar level and tend to be located in small to medium-sized hospitals and concentrated in six areas: emergency medicine, anaesthesia, general surgery, orthopaedic surgery, general medicine and paediatrics.<\/p><p>In 2010, the HSE acted to address the issue of six month terms of contract on the basis that the configuration, tenure and supports for such posts were inadequate to attract the number and calibre of NCHDs required to provide safe, high quality services to patients and clients of the public health service.  In this context, the HSE prepared proposals that hospitals move from the standard NCHD job offer of a six month contract at a single hospital site to a standard two year contract of employment.  This would involve an element of rotation, including a placement for six months in a large regional centre or complex tertiary service setting.  Such posts would remain graded as SHO or registrar posts, and appointments would be made under NCHD Contract 2010.  The HSE has proposed that all vacant SHO and registrar posts would be advertised on this revised basis to existing staff locally, to agency staff nationally and internationally, and on a broader international basis.<\/p><p>The proposals are among a range of issues to be discussed between health service management and the Irish Medical Organisation under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission in the coming weeks.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, has asked me to assure the Senator that the HSE is committed to ensuring all doctors are given contracts that support service delivery and offer opportunities to post holders to develop their skills and expertise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900040#PP00400","speaker":"1046"},{"type":"speech","time":1349805000,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that response.

I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.<\/p><p>In recent months, I have noticed many problems with bus services, especially in the commuter belt of County Meath.  I understand these problems are also a feature of other parts of the commuter belt.  The problems arise mainly with Bus \u00c9ireann.  I am not here to complain about Bus \u00c9ireann, but to encourage the company to provide an even better service than at present.<\/p><p>It has been brought to my attention that commuters on the 109 route from as far away as Kells are unable to board buses on some mornings because the buses are full since leaving Cavan.  This is not acceptable.  Other passengers have boarded buses in Kells that have taken two and half hours to reach Dublin.<\/p> <p>I have received complaints from constituents in south County Meath further down the No. 109 route and related connecting routes onto the old M3, particularly the No. 111 route from Trim and Batterstown.  Some commuters cannot get onto those buses either.  On three of the five days last week, at least two dozen commuters were unable to get on buses and were subsequently late for work.  That is unacceptable in this day and age, particularly when one considers the prices people are paying for tickets.  I understand it is \u20ac54 per week for a ten journey ticket from Kells and Cavan, and \u20ac38.50 from Dunshaughlin.  An annual ticket from the Fairyhouse area costs nearly \u20ac1,500, before the taxsaver break.  These are working people who are glad to have a job, but they find they cannot get on the buses.  This is a service the State provides through Bus \u00c9ireann.<\/p><p>I also wish to highlight the ongoing issue regarding the town of Stamullen, which I have also raised with the National Transport Authority.  Stamullen is the largest town in Ireland without a public bus service.  I do not blame the current Government or the previous one for that, but that is the position.  The town has grown without the service.  One can walk two miles to Gormanston, where there is a fantastic bus and train service, but the buses do not go through the town of Stamullen.  I have suggested to the National Transport Authority that it consider diverting a number of the buses on the Drogheda-Dublin route to go through Stamullen to give a direct service to the people.  There was an initiative by the last Government under the rural transport initiative which provided a connecting service from the village to Gormanston, but it did not work out.  It was too expensive.  It meant an extra \u20ac2 or \u20ac3 on the price of the ticket and it was not worthwhile for people to pay it.<\/p><p>People in County Meath are being made late for work while some people, such as those in Stamullen, do not have a service.  I understand the National Transport Authority is conducting an audit of public transport in the commuter belt.  That is what the authority told me when I contacted it.  The authority should examine the issues I have raised.  I look forward to the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900040#PP00800","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349805600,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  It is one that has been raised in other parts of the country as well.<\/p><p>First, it must be stated that the National Transport Authority, NTA, is responsible for securing the provision of public passenger transport services.  Neither I nor the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, exercise ministerial powers in the area.  Where the public bus passenger services are provided commercially without a public service obligation, the NTA regulates the provision of those services under the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.  Where a public service obligation applies to a public bus passenger service, the NTA provides those services in accordance with the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 in the form of public service contracts.  These contracts can either be direct award contracts, such as those with Dublin Bus and Bus \u00c9ireann, or competitively tendered.  At all times, the NTA must work within the budget that has been provided for the public service obligation, which has reduced by 20% since 2009.<\/p><p>It is a matter for Dublin Bus and Bus \u00c9ireann, with the agreement of the NTA in the case of subvented services, to decide on service levels and changes to services, which takes account of customer volumes and needs, fare revenue and the funding available for public service obligation services.  The Dublin commuter belt consists of a mixture of commercial licensed services provided by Bus \u00c9ireann and other private operators and routes which have a public service obligation, and are provided under contract by Dublin Bus, Bus \u00c9ireann and larnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann.  The NTA is undertaking an extensive review of the services provided in the Dublin commuter belt and there may be changes to those public service obligation services to better meet the needs of the public transport customer within the resources that are available.<\/p><p>The CIE group has to date implemented significant cost management measures, including the implementation of the Deloitte cost and efficiency review of Dublin Bus and Bus \u00c9ireann.  To compensate for the reduced passenger revenues and public service obligation subvention, CIE engaged in a cost recovery programme which has focused on revisions to its network of services and, in particular, the implementation of the Dublin Bus network direct project.  Over the past two years, Dublin Bus has revised its full network of services to better meet the needs of customers.  All services have been adjusted in line with customer demand at both peak and off-peak times.  Dublin Bus constantly monitors service performance and, where required, adjustments are made.<\/p><p>I am aware of the redesign of Expressway services and other Bus \u00c9ireann routes and have made inquiries with the company on the matter.  Expressway services do not receive a subsidy either directly or indirectly.  Bus \u00c9ireann's services were not as direct as their competitors and due to that, and the recession, have lost passengers and revenue.  In order to gain competitiveness it has, therefore, had to redesign its Expressway services.  I appreciate that changes to bus services will inconvenience some passengers.  However, given the financial position that the CIE companies find themselves in, there is no alternative for the companies but to ensure that commercial operations operate on a commercial footing and that, unfortunately, limits their scope for changing the services.<\/p><p>That said, there is still a comprehensive service offering along Expressway routes through services from Bus \u00c9ireann along with other operators.  I have asked the NTA to put together integrated timetables of all bus and rail services across all affected routes and these should be published shortly.<\/p><p>Following the establishment of the NTA in December 2009, the implementation and development of infrastructure projects in the greater Dublin area, GDA, comes under the remit of the NTA.  The NTA is also responsible for the roll-out of real-time passenger information, RTPI, in the GDA and the four regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  The RTPI project in the GDA involves the installation of up to 500 on-street information signs capable of displaying the arrival times of buses.  These RTPI displays are being located at selected bus stops or interchange points in the GDA.  The first phase of sign deployments is now 98% complete in the GDA.<\/p><p>We continue to provide for significant capital investment in both bus companies.  In the case of Dublin Bus, 80 new buses are being funded by the NTA and delivery of new buses has now commenced and is expected to cost in the region of \u20ac25 million.  The full order will be delivered on a staged basis as the buses are manufactured over the remaining months of 2012.  In 2011, Dublin Bus received approximately \u20ac3.7 million in funding towards bus refurbishment and a further \u20ac750,000 towards its bus shelter programme.  This year the NTA expects to provide up to \u20ac3.5 million for fleet refurbishment and about \u20ac750,000 for its bus shelter programme.  In 2011, 60 new buses were delivered to Bus \u00c9ireann at a cost to the Exchequer of \u20ac18.5 million.<\/p><p>The NTA is introducing the Leap card scheme in the GDA on a phased basis, based on smart card technology.  Phase 1 of the Leap card scheme was launched in December 2011 on the services of Dublin Bus, Luas and Irish Rail DART-commuter rail.  Further roll out of the scheme is continuing in 2012 with the launch of the student travel card in September leading to significant growth in Leap cards issued arising from this launch.  Bus \u00c9ireann commenced pilot operations in September on its eastern regional services in the GDA.  Additional private bus operators will be integrated into the scheme over the coming months.  In early 2013, annual and monthly passes will be issued on the Leap card, as cardholders renew passes, and additional products such as multi-journey tickets will be rolled out on Dublin Bus in early 2013.  Funding has been provided to Dublin Bus and Bus \u00c9ireann from the overall capital allocation for the scheme of \u20ac55.4 million.  The scheme continues to function well with almost 150,000 cards issued to date and 8.5 million journeys undertaken using Leap cards.<\/p><p>On the specific issue of the No. 109 route raised by the Senator, if he provides me with more information I will ask the NTA to investigate the matter.  We have received a huge amount of correspondence relating to various routes due to the work that Bus \u00c9ireann is now undertaking as a result of the unfortunate circumstances in which it finds itself.  As public representatives, we must take cognisance of the holistic picture, particularly in the case of Expressway services.  It is a competitive area and there are other providers.  However, I do not deny that the Senator has outlined certain issues that require examination by my office and that will be done.  On the matter of no public bus provision in the town mentioned by the Senator, if he provides me with further information I will certainly look into it.  Perhaps he would do so at his convenience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012100900041#QQ00200","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1349805600,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I will be glad to do that.  Stamullen is the largest town in Ireland with no public bus service.  There is no private service either.  The issue with the No. 109 route is a matter for Bus \u00c9ireann as there is no competing regular commuter service available to commuters on that route.  Other parts of Meath have a regular private bus service that competes with Bus \u00c9ireann.  The people who are paying the price of tickets, and tickets are not cheap now, are entitled to a service from Bus \u00c9ireann.  It is not fair, or even contractual, for a full bus to drive past when no alternative is put in place.  Private operators who are running commuter services could put alternatives in place.  There should at least be some system whereby the bus takes the annual ticket holders first if there happens to be a shortage of bus space and, perhaps, provide another bus.
