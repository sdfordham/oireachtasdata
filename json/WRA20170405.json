Lesson content was designed specifically for each grouping. In 3rd to 6th   class, children remain in their class groups throughout the year and learn about different faiths and religions together. Belief-specific teaching is integrated into GMGY for these classes.<\/p>  <p>The manner in which schools deliver belief-specific teaching in Junior Infants to 2nd   class has evolved. The majority of CNS schools no longer group children according to their beliefs for the four week period. Instead, these schools have integrated belief-specific teaching so that all children learn about different religions and beliefs together and all class groups remain together throughout. As I indicated in a recent statement, I see merit in this approach. <\/p>  <p>  This model has the merit of responding to the needs of parents who wish their children to be able to prepare for specific events - for example Communion and Confirmation in the case of Catholic families &ndash; but also respects the best principles of inclusion and mutual understanding that are central to multi-denominational education. <\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is to commence a review of the GMGY programme for Junior Infants to 2nd   class, starting in September 2017.

The report provides an important summary of the current position in relation to the various initiatives taken by successive governments in support of persons who were abused when as children they resided in institutions and it sets out the position in regard to how those initiatives have been funded. The report highlights in particular the fact that the religious congregations who managed many of those institutions will fund at most approximately 21% of the &euro;1.5 billion cost of the response to residential institutional child abuse with the State, i.e. the taxpayer meeting the vast bulk of those costs. <\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed and frustrated that the organisations responsible for protecting children and managing the institutions in which abuse of children took place have failed to adequately contribute towards the cost of the response that has been put in place. It has been the position of successive Governments that, given that the religious congregations were responsible for the management of institutions where horrific abuse of children took place, as documented in the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (the &ldquo;Ryan Report&rdquo;), they should commit to making further substantial contributions towards the cost of abuse.\u00a0 Having regard to the work of the independent panel's report, the Government adopted a position that the congregations had the resources to bring their contribution over time to 50% of the then estimated costs. Regrettably the congregations have never agreed to this position, with the result that the State has met the bulk of the costs involved.<\/p>  <p>  To date contributions amounting to some &euro;210 million in cash, counselling and property transfers have been made by the 18 religious congregations who managed most of the institutions. These contributions are being made under two rounds: the binding 2002 Indemnity Agreement and the voluntary offers made in 2009 in the aftermath of the publication of the Ryan Report.<\/p>  <p>  Some &euro;112.9 million of the &euro;128 million (or 88%) provided for under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement has been fully contributed. 11 property transfers remain to be fully completed. Work to complete these transfers is actively progressing and I should point out that in most of the remaining cases the transfer process is at a very advanced stage. It is worth noting also that most of the properties are already in use by the intended recipients.<\/p>  <p>  The offers made in the aftermath of the publication of the Ryan Report by many of the congregations that were party to the 2002 Indemnity Agreement, included cash and properties and were valued by the congregations at &euro;352.6m.\u00a0I should stress that these offers are voluntary and do not form part of any agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Regrettably one significant element of the most recent offer, relating to playing fields and associated lands, valued at &euro;127 million, was withdrawn by the Christian Brothers. When this is combined with some changes in the valuation of properties previously offered, the total value of the voluntary offers currently in place stands at &euro;193 million, of which contributions of cash and property amounting to some &euro;97.3 million have been realised. It is expected that the outstanding congregational cash contributions will be received by 2018 while work is progressing to complete remaining property transfers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500069#WRB04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":60,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500069#WRB05000"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[16497\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500069#WRB05100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason the construction of a school (details supplied) is being delayed.","asker":"1311","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":62,"content":"<p>The proposed new school referred to by the Deputy is at an advanced stage of the tender process with tenders due to be returned by 5pm on 12 April 2017.

The contingency framework that the Government put in place maps the key issues that will be most important to Ireland in the coming weeks and months.  My own Department contributed fully to the preparation of the education components of that framework.

Consultation has been fundamental to my Department&rsquo;s preparations for Brexit.

Schools will be frontloaded with resources to provide additional\u00a0teaching support to all pupils who need such support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Where parents have concerns that their child is not getting access to the support the child needs, they should raise this concern with the Principal and in the event that they are not happy with the response they should raise this with the Board of Management. <\/p>  <p>  As the profiled allocation is made to the school, schools may appeal the basis of this allocation and specifically whether the data used to calculate the profile was correct and whether it was correctly applied in the case of the school.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE\u00a0has published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: www.ncse.ie. \u00a0Should a school wish to appeal they should do so by March 31st 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Schools will be able to appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017\/18 allocation.<\/p>  <p>  DES Circulars 0013\/2017 and 0014\/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In advance of the submission of an appeal, schools should read carefully the DES circulars and in particular the relevant section, which relates to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The model\u00a0will\u00a0also allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances\u00a0or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very\u00a0substantially prior to the next review of the model.

The report outlines the funding challenges in the sector and offers recommendations for the medium term.  As committed to in the Programme for Government, the report has been referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills for consideration.  However, it is important to recognise, as the Cassells Report has done, that doing nothing is not an option and that other measures to improve equality of access will also be necessary.<\/p>  <p>  While Cassells deals with the medium and long term funding needs of higher education my Department and I also have to consider the immediate challenges and in that context the Department placed a particular focus on this area in Budget 2017 securing additional funding for the sector for the first time in recent years.  In Action Plan Education 2017, Higher Education will be a particular focus.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2017 an additional &euro;36.5m has been made available with &euro;160m additional overall agreed for the next three years.  This is the first time in nine years that additional Exchequer funding has been secured for the higher education sector.  This will assist with demographic increases and initiatives on disadvantage, skills, research and flexible learning.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, are currently undertaking a public consultation process on a proposed Exchequer-Employer investment mechanism for the higher and further education sectors.  The mechanism, which estimates an increase in the National Training Fund levy from 0.7% to 1% between 2018 and 2020, could yield an additional &euro;200m revenue in 2020.  Details of the process are available on the websites of both Departments.

However, I believe it has a bright future ahead of it and a major role to play in providing choice to parents in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Community National Schools are multi-denominational and they provide for belief nurturing during the school day.\u00a0 The aim of the model has been to cater for the diversity present within the community in a single school setting.\u00a0 The philosophy of the Community National School as a multi-denominational school is based on best practice in this area, and on each child better understanding and ultimately celebrating both their own and their friends&rsquo; belief and cultural identities.  Belief identity is explicitly not left at the school gate, but used as a means of enriching the learning experience on the basis of mutual understanding and integration.<\/p>  <p>  &lsquo;Goodness Me, Goodness You&rsquo; (GMGY) is the patron&rsquo;s programme that underpins the characteristic spirit of CNS schools and is a common programme suitable for pupils of all faiths and beliefs.  The GMGY programme is being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and delivered on an action research basis.  The action research approach allows for the development of the curriculum with the content and approaches being adjusted and adapted\u00a0based\u00a0on feedback on the material and methodologies.<\/p>  <p>  In Junior Infants to 2nd Class, the children follow the GMGY programme together for the majority of the school year, exploring common themes.  There is a belief-specific aspect of the programme.  In the junior classes only, children have been grouped for a four week period during GMGY time according to their faith or belief tradition, in line with the wishes of their parents.  Lesson content was designed specifically for each grouping.  In 3rd to 6th class, children remain in their class groups throughout the year and learn about different faiths and religions together.  Belief-specific teaching is integrated into GMGY for these classes.<\/p>  <p>  The manner in which schools deliver belief-specific teaching in Junior Infants to 2nd class has evolved.  The majority of CNS schools no longer group children according to their beliefs for the four week period.  Instead, these schools have integrated belief-specific teaching so that all children learn about different religions and beliefs together and all class groups remain together throughout.  As I indicated in a recent statement, I see merit in this approach.<\/p>  <p>  This model has the merit of responding to the needs of parents who wish their children to be able to prepare for specific events - for example Communion and Confirmation in the case of Catholic families &ndash; but also respects the best principles of inclusion and mutual understanding that are central to multi-denominational education.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is to commence a review of the GMGY programme for Junior Infants to 2nd class, starting in September 2017.  As part of that review, the belief-specific teaching aspect of the programme will be examined.  The Education and Training Boards, as patrons, are also looking at how Goodness Me Goodness You can be delivered on the ground in the most inclusive fashion possible.  I look forward to seeing the outcomes of these processes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500070#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Participation","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500070#WRC01900"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[16542\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500070#WRC02000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on County Wexford's low third level educational attainment rates, which according to the Wexford Local Economic and Community Plan 2016-2021, are the third lowest in the country; the actions he is taking to address this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>The higher education system continues to respond strongly to the challenge of meeting Ireland&rsquo;s human capital needs.

Overall student numbers in the sector increased from 196,000 in 2011\/12 to about 210,000 in 2014\/15.  In addition to this general growth, additional programmes have been put in place to address specific skills needs, through the Springboard+ programme and the ICT skills initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  The performance of the Higher Education system in meeting human capital needs is also strong by comparison with other European countries: Ireland has one of the highest rates of 30&ndash;34-year-olds with higher education attainment, and Ireland performs particularly strongly in terms of graduates with STEM qualifications when considered against fellow EU member countries.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland ranks 3rd in the EU28 in its tertiary attainment rate (Higher Education Qualification) (52.3% in 2015) for 30 &ndash;

Within this approach, there is capacity to allow religious schools to require parents or students to indicate some support or respect for the ethos of the school.<\/p>  <p>  As I specifically outlined in the consultation paper, I\u00a0am mindful of the need to avoid possible pitfalls and unintended consequences with each of these approaches, including possible impacts on minority religions and on the wishes of Protestant, Jewish, Islamic and other communities to be able to run schools in accordance with their ethos and admit children from their communities to attend those schools.<\/p>  <p>  Other possible consequences to be avoided include possible breaches of the constitution, technical and administrative difficulties impacting on the capacity to effectively run the system of over 4000 schools and the possibility of creating &lsquo;postcode lotteries&rsquo;, such as other countries have experienced, resulting in pronounced divergence in the quality of schools in more advantaged compared to less advantaged areas. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has begun the process of examining the submissions and formulating next steps. I will then develop and implement measures to deal with this issue.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the teaching of religion in schools, Article 44 of the Constitution and Section 30 of the Education Act 1998 provides that parents have a right to have their children opt out of religion classes if they so wish. <\/p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school&rsquo;s arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.

In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year. <\/p>  <p>  An\u00a0additional 900 teaching posts\u00a0have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model. The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional\u00a0teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools. This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. <\/p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide for additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.

Accordingly, where a young person under the age of 18 comes into conflict with the law, the principles of the Act apply.  A key principle in the Act is that detention should be a last resort.  In support of this principle, the legislation facilitates the incremental application of a series of measures, ranging from diversion in the first instance through community based sanctions, to detention.<\/p>  <p>  The first main filter in the youth justice system is the Diversion Programme operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, involving at different stages and depending on the seriousness of the offence, the informal caution (without supervision) and the formal caution (with supervision), including possible involvement with a Garda Youth Diversion Project.  The second main filter is the range of non-custodial sanctions available to the courts including court orders for dismissal; conditional discharge; the payment of fines, costs or compensation; the binding over of parents; and orders imposing community sanctions supervised by the Probation Service. In supervising community sanctions, the Probation Service utilises a number of community based organisations with dedicated resources to work with young offenders.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally and as a last resort, detention in the Oberstown Children Detention Campus may be used.  In this regard, I should mention that my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Dr. Katherine Zappone recently announced the roll-out of a pilot Bail Supervision Scheme for young people which will assist them in complying with their bail conditions pending the hearing of their case.  International evidence suggests that this scheme should impact remand trends by offering the court a new option &lsquo;bail with supervision&rsquo; as an alternative to a remand in detention.  This alternative option should also help a young person to moderate their chaotic circumstances and promote greater stability. <\/p>  <p>  It will be seen, therefore, that the focus under the law is to adopt a graduated approach which in the main serves to keep the vast majority of young offenders out of the criminal justice system.  The Deputy might wish to note that in its 2015 Report, the statutory committee to monitor the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme reported that 74% of children referred to the Diversion Programme were admitted to it, thereby keeping them out of the criminal justice system and away from the potential negative influence of more serious recidivist offenders.  The report also highlighted that 71% of children referred to the Programme were referred only once that year.<\/p>  <p>  The operation of the above statutory framework is substantially supported by the significant investment by my Department through the Irish Youth Justice Service in community based programmes which are directed at diverting young people from further involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour. These youth justice community programmes, which are managed by Community Based Organisations, proceed on the basis of evidence that diversion programmes in the form of high quality preventative intervention can do more to reduce crime than more costly custodial sanctions. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, approximately &euro;21m, inclusive of &euro;4m in Dormant Accounts Fund monies, will be allocated by my Department to Garda Youth Diversion Projects, Young Persons Probation Projects and other community based youth justice initiatives around the country. This substantial investment in community level youth justice projects and activities is managed in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Probation Service.  I might also point out that all 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects and four of the eighteen Young Persons Probation Projects are part supported by the Irish Government and the European Social Fund (ESF) as part of the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020.  The projects attract this EU funding as a social inclusion measure which increases the education and employment opportunities available to young people in addition to diverting them from any further involvement with the criminal justice system.  <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of this investment in youth crime intervention work is to engage young people in a process of learning and development that enables them to make positive lifestyle choices.  The targeted supports involved seek to provide participants with the life skills that help them to make positive choices and desist from criminal and anti-social behaviour which in turn will enable them to be positive contributors to society.  Project activities are wide and varied focusing on the specific risk and needs of young offenders which in the case of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects are assessed upon their referral into a project.  Each project develops a tailored suite of interventions to use with each young person based on the risks and needs identified.  Examples of activities undertaken across the projects include education and employment related programmes, peer relations programmes, substance abuse programmes, personality and behaviour related programmes with referral to appropriate agencies where required, leisure and recreation programmes, family and parenting related programmes, etc.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is probably aware, the Youth Action Project Sligo (YAPS) Garda Youth Diversion Project serves Sligo Town and its environs. In 2016 the Project's catchment area was extended in the Sligo\/Leitrim area. The YAPS Project engages with young people in Leitrim in youth centres based in Manorhamilton and Drumshanbo by way of outreach support.  The Monitoring Committee referred to above reported in 2015 that some 153 young people in the Sligo\/Leitrim area were referred to the Diversion Programme that year, down 4% on the number of referrals in 2014.  Recent information in relation to youth crime in County Sligo and County Leitrim indicates that theft from shops, breach of bail and public order offences are the three most common offences in the catchment area. Nationally, theft and related offences, public order and damage to property were the main categories of offences for which children were referred to the Diversion Programme in 2015. In 2017, my Department through the Irish Youth Justice Service is providing &euro;116,500 to the YAPS Project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500072#WRE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Money Laundering","counter":179,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500072#WRE02100"},{"type":"question","counter":180,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[16831\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500072#WRE02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when she will bring forward the criminal justice (money laundering and terrorism financing) (amendment) Bill on the fourth EU money laundering directive; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":181,"content":"<p>In December 2016, the Government approved the publication of the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill which will give effect to most of the provisions contained in the 4th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (4AMLD), the aim of which is the strengthening of laws in the EU to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

The Bill is currently being drafted. <\/p>  <p>  While the Bill will give effect to the greater part of the Directive, some provisions (i.e., the establishment of registers of beneficial ownership of companies and trusts) are being transposed into Irish law by my colleague, the Minister for Finance. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500072#WRE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":182,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500072#WRE02400"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[16878\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500072#WRE02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons who wrongfully lost their driving licences as a result of serious discrepancies within the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":184,"content":"<p>The specific information sought by the Deputy is not available at present.

Section 117(1) of the Act requires the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to benchmark their recommendations by reference to the best standards of comparable police services.  Arising from this requirement, every inspection conducted by the Garda Inspectorate, and any recommendation arising, has involved examining and taking account of policing practices in other jurisdictions. <\/p><p>The Garda Professional Standards Unit, which was established under Section 24 of the 2005 Act, undertakes reviews, as directed by the Garda Commissioner, into operational, administrative and management matters relating to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at all levels.

This will be subject to modifications to ensure the close relationship with communities is maintained in large rural Divisions.  In line with international norms, a medium term target of 20% civilians to be achieved by 2021 has been set. <\/p><p>The implementation of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme is primarily a matter for the Commissioner.  However, the Government decided that the Policing Authority should be requested, in accordance with section 117(A) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended), to monitor the implementation of the agreed recommendations in 'Changing Policing in Ireland' and to report to me at regular intervals.

This investment in human capital is supported by a &euro;300 million capital plan that will deliver leading-edge technology and other capital infrastructure to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The question of not returning a person to a place where certain fundamental rights would be breached (or <i>non refoulement<\/i>as it is commonly referred to) is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order.

The Act contains provisions which strengthen existing criminal law in combatting child exploitation and, in particular, address the use of modern communication technologies as a tool which may lead to child sexual exploitation. <\/p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Act creates two offences.  The first criminalises persons who contact children either online or through mobile communications such as text messaging for the purpose of sexually exploiting the child.  This offence is targeted at the initial stages of grooming and does not require physical contact or meeting between the adult and child in question.  The offence does not necessarily require that the communication contain a sexual advance or include sexual material as these are not generally features of sophisticated grooming.  This offence carries a penalty of up to 14 years&rsquo; imprisonment.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 8 also includes an offence of sending sexually explicit material to a child.  This offence protects children from unwarranted and unwanted advances.  There is also recognition that the intention behind this type of activity may be to expose the child to such material with a view to developing the child&rsquo;s familiarity with such material or activity.  The penalty for this offence is up to 5 years&rsquo; imprisonment.   <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the broader area of safety online which would include children as well as adults, the Law Reform Commission published its Report on Harmful Communications and Digital Safety in September 2016.  While noting the positive benefits to society of the interconnected digital world in which we live, the report also noted the emerging trend to engage in online communications that cause significant harm to others. <\/p>  <p>  In December 2016, the Government gave its approval for the drafting of a General Scheme of a Bill which would provide for new and amended criminal offences along the lines set out in that report.  It is intended that this Bill will address the criminal law aspects of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report.  The Commission has proposed extending some existing offences and creating some new criminal offences specific to digital communications.  The precise formulation of the offences will be subject to review and potential variation during the drafting of the General Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  While it is not feasible to regulate or monitor the internet in anticipation of all possible incidents such as cyberbullying, if a member of the public becomes aware of activity on the internet which they suspect may be illegal, they can report it confidentially to Hotline.ie which is operated by the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland with oversight by the Office for Internet Safety (OIS) in my Department.  Hotline.ie provides the public with the means to report illegal online content, such as child sexual abuse material and liaises with an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as appropriate, to have illegal content taken down. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has an arrangement in place with a large internet service provider to block access to child sexual abuse content in accordance with a list they provide.  Among the aims of this initiative is to reduce inadvertent viewing by members of the public, including children, of this illegal material.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has a Schools Programme where personal safety issues, including online safety, are highlighted and discussed with children and young people in schools.<\/p>  <p>  In order to assist the public to stay safe on the internet, the OIS in my Department has a series of booklets aimed at parents.  The booklets provide information on various aspects of internet safety including filtering, using social networking sites and cyberbullying.  The booklet on cyberbullying gives information on such matters as prevention and key advice for children, young people and parents including advice for parents who suspect that their own child may be a cyberbully.  These information resources are made available free of charge on the OIS website and also in hard copy on request.

The position in relation to the provision of translation services is unchanged: the current service provider is contractually obliged to provide such services in a professional manner and in accordance with industry standards.  Free online translation services are not used by the International Protection office (IPO).<\/p><p>The Chief International Protection Officer (CIPO) who, under the International Protection Act 2015, is independent in the performance of his functions, has further informed me that the quality of all translations provided is kept under constant review, both by the contractor and by the IPO.  Any issues raised regarding the quality of translations are immediately addressed as part of this ongoing quality review.  As part of this process, the CIPO has advised me that the IPO is engaged with the service provider at present about a number of quality issues in respect of the Application for International Protection Questionnaire.  The IPO will be in contact with any applicants who may be impacted, if required, when the quality review has been completed.<\/p><p>On the issue of the return of questionnaires, may I refer the Deputy to my responses to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 86, 88, 89 and 102 of 23 February, 2017.  The Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2) is designed to be used by the IPO on an ongoing basis and not just as part of the transition arrangements, therefore the questionnaire does not, and cannot indicate any time-frame for its return.  The indicated time-frame for return is detailed with the accompanying documentation.<\/p><p>As I have stated previously, I can inform the Deputy that the information sent to transition applicants in January- February 2017 made clear in Paragraph 7.3 that the IPO 2 Questionnaire should be returned <i>'if possible<\/i>, no later than 20 working days from the date of the covering letter'.  The next paragraph 7.4 went on to state clearly that opportunities to add to the information supplied exist up to two weeks, <i>'if you are in a position to do so,' <\/i>before the scheduled interview in order to '<i>facilitate the translation of documents if required and ensure that the IPO interviewer has all your papers available and considered in advance of the interview date<\/i>'.  The word deadline or statutory deadline does not appear and no negative consequences for failing to meet an 'if possible' time-frame were included or implied.  The twenty working day time-frame reflects the willingness of the IPO to begin work on the new single procedure as soon as possible in respect of legacy applications, particularly those in prioritised categories, and a satisfactory number of applicants were in a position to respond promptly, allowing the single application process to commence.<\/p><p>I am happy to restate that this is purely an administrative time-frame and NGOs and service providers have been informed of that throughout the planning process.  Flexibility is being provided by the IPO in recognition of the complexity of the process for applicants affected by the transition provisions and the demands placed on their legal advisors by the transitional arrangements - the wisdom of accessing legal advice is stressed in the Questionnaire.  A call centre is available to answer any queries and extra time is available if required for the completion of the IPO 2 Questionnaire.  It can be seen therefore that no impediment or disadvantage exists to prevent the careful filling out of the new single application form.  I understand, so as to remove any false impressions that may be circulating abroad that the 'if possible' time frame is some sort of statutory deadline, that the IPO has written to the members of the Customer Liaison Panel to confirm the arrangements and that similar clarification has been provided on the IPO website.  <\/p><p>The CIPO informs me that adherence to time-frames helps to ensure that the work of the Office continues and that applicants get timely decisions, particularly those in prioritised categories.  For those applications which have been made since the commencement of the 2015 Act i.e. on or after 31 December 2016, and are not affected by the complex transition provisions, the IPO is asking those applicants to adhere to the time-frames indicated in their accompanying documentation.  However, flexibility continues to be afforded to this group of applicants, if, for example, they are waiting on legal advice.<\/p><p>Applicants have a duty to cooperate as set out in Section 27 of the International Protection Act 2015 (the 2015 Act) and there are consequences for failing to cooperate set out in Section 38, therefore it is entirely appropriate and necessary to include an alert in the Questionnaire.  It should also be noted that Section 38 of the 2015 Act, which deals with the consequences of non-cooperation, sets out specifically the procedure to be followed in these cases and gives applicants ample opportunities to address any potential non-cooperation issues.<\/p><p>In relation to the availability of the Questionnaire, under the 2015 Act, applicants are required to apply in person for international protection either at the frontier of within the State.  At their time of application and in line with the requirements of the 2015 Act, applicants are fingerprinted, photographed, issued a reference number and a temporary Residence Certificate.  Normally at that time, the IPO provides the IPO 2 Questionnaire and an accompanying information pack.  In order to maintain the integrity of the Questionnaire and the application process generally, it has never been the practice to make the questionnaire available publicly or online.  Such publication would leave the process open to abuse by non-applicants and those who are not at the frontier or within the State as required by law.  Additional copies of the Questionnaire are, however, provided to applicants and their legal representatives on request, once their application reference numbers have been assigned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500073#WRF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500073#WRF01450"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[16975\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500073#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she is satisfied as to the effectiveness of the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995 as it applies in respect of mortgages between customers and financial institutions; her plans to strengthen these regulations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that this matter is still being examined by my Department in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the matter will be kept under review in terms of any definitive additional obligations arising.<\/p><p>The EU Directive on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts was given effect in this jurisdiction by Regulations in 1995 and by amending Regulations in 2000, 2013 and 2014.

Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  My Department is responsible for the payment of fees and expenses to the legal practitioners.  I have no function in the day to day operation of the scheme, the assignment of lawyers or the granting of aid which are matters for the court and, as such, are handled by the judiciary.<\/p><p>In regard to standard court fees, I wish to inform the Deputy that fees charged in the courts are set by means of Statutory Instrument.  Court fees orders are made by myself as the Minister for Justice and Equality with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.

Work conducted in the Department to assess the potential economic and financial sector implications arising from Brexit, includes a scoping study in November 2015 under the Department of Finance-ESRI joint research programme; an initial short-term economic estimate published in the Summer Economic Statement 2016; an in-depth analysis of the possible sectorial and regional impacts of Brexit arising from Ireland's trade relationship with the UK, published with Budget 2017; and, a joint research paper with the ESRI\u00a0that modelled the medium to long term macroeconomic impact of Brexit under a number of scenarios, including a WTO relationship.

In Budget 2017, I confirmed the Government's intention to establish a rainy day fund, to commence in 2019 after Ireland has achieved its Medium Term Objective under the EU's fiscal rules and is running balanced or surplus budgets;\u00a0I also announced the Government's decision to set a new domestic target of a debt to GDP ratio of 45 percent to be reached by the mid-2020s, or thereafter, depending on economic growth. \u00a0These decisions will help to ensure that the public finances can withstand negative impacts from Brexit or other economic shocks.  Also in Budget 2017, I announced a number of sectorial\u00a0measures to mitigate Brexit impacts in exposed sectors of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are working closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to assess the potential impact of Brexit on the SME sector.\u00a0 The Deputy may also wish to note that, aside from the SBCI,\u00a0there are significant Government measures to support the financing needs of SMEs that are facing challenges (over 170 supports are provided by 30 separate agencies).\u00a0 These\u00a0measures\u00a0include the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices and the Credit Review Office.\u00a0 These supports\u00a0will play an important role in assisting companies and SMEs to meet\u00a0the challenges of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, Minister of State Eoghan Murphy T.D. has responsibility for Financial Services, including the implementation of the International Financial Services (IFS) 2020 Strategy. \u00a0Important work is ongoing, as part of IFS 2020, to ensure that we maximise opportunities for inward investment arising as a result of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  We are now at the start of a process within which there is expected to be a number of phases.  The Department of Finance contingency work continues to examine all scenarios in relation to Brexit, and will continue to monitor the economic impacts, to carry out relevant analysis and to frame budgetary policy advice in this new context. \u00a0The work being done by the Department will help to ensure that Ireland will be in a position to respond to the economic challenges arising from Brexit and to ensure that Ireland's interests are protected in the upcoming negotiations at EU level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500074#WRG03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Competitiveness","counter":258,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500074#WRG03600"},{"type":"question","counter":259,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[16929\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500074#WRG03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which the economy remains competitive in view of Brexit and the triggering of Article 50; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":260,"content":"<p>Significant progress has been made in recent years in improving Ireland's competitiveness. \u00a0The latest figures from the Central Bank of Ireland, show that Ireland's real harmonised competitiveness indicator (a widely used measure of competitiveness in Europe) has improved by over 20 per cent between its peak in 2008 and February 2017.  This improvement has occurred notwithstanding the substantial appreciation of euro against sterling in the second half of last year, following the UK's vote to leave the EU last June.<\/p>  <p>  The gains in Irish competitiveness since 2008 have been hard-won through productivity improvements and\u00a0wage and price moderation.  It is important that this competitiveness is\u00a0preserved and continues to support growth.\u00a0 This is all the more important given the risks posed by Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  We must be cognisant that favourable exchange rate movements can reverse, as can be seen for example in the strengthening of the euro against sterling last year.  Similarly, gains from the fall in oil prices\u00a0may unwind in the future.  Indeed, the drag on consumer prices from low oil prices is already beginning to ease.  In addition, excessive rent and house price growth are also a potential threat to competitiveness. <\/p>  <p>  These risks highlight the importance of maintaining competitiveness oriented policies, including sustainable fiscal policies, to help address emerging uncertainties.

In this context, S.I. No. 47\/2015 (the statutory instrument which implements the mortgage measures) provides that a \"first-time buyer\" means, \"subject to paragraph (2), a borrower to whom no housing loan has ever before been advanced\"; (paragraph 2 subsequently provides that where the borrower under a housing loan is more than\u00a0one person and a housing loan has previously been advanced to\u00a0any one\u00a0of those persons, none of those persons is a first-time buyer).<\/p>  <p>  On the Revenue aspect, there are two schemes in the Taxes Consolidation Acts 1997 which provide assistance for first-time purchasers. Section 266A provides for a repayment of DIRT to first-time purchasers and was introduced by the 2014\u00a0Finance Act. Section 477C is the new Help-to-Buy scheme that was introduced by the 2016\u00a0Finance Act.\u00a0For the purposes of these provisions, a first-time purchaser is an individual who has not, either individually or jointly with any other person or persons, previously purchased or previously built, directly or indirectly, on his or her own behalf a dwelling.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter of fact whether an individual meets the requirements as a \"first-time buyer\" or\u00a0\"first-time\u00a0purchaser\" under the two different statutory frameworks. Where the position is unclear, for example where a person has their name added to a mortgage, the individual should provide full details to\u00a0their proposed lender or to the\u00a0Revenue Commissioners as appropriate\u00a0so that they may consider the position and assist the individual.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Help-to-Buy Scheme, an individual who is aggrieved by a decision made by the Revenue Commissioners to refuse a claim may appeal that decision to the Appeal Commissioners within 30 days of the notice of the decision. Likewise, if an individual is unhappy with a decision made by a regulated financial service provider, the errors and complaints resolution provisions of the Consumer Protection Code will be available, and if necessary a complaint can be submitted to the independent Financial Services Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500075#WRH00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":267,"content":"<p>Question No. 130 answered with Question No. 123.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts Data","counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500075#WRH00650"},{"type":"question","counter":269,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[16984\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500075#WRH00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of private investigation firms hired by statutory agencies and\/or semi-State agencies under the aegis of his Department in the past five years to date in 2017; the names of the firms; the amount they were paid; if they supplied his Department with a report on completion of their work; if he will provide copies of reports submitted to him from these firms as a result of this engagement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1222","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":277,"content":"<p>My role as Minister for Finance is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions. <\/p>  <p>  Credit unions are regulated and supervised by the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank who\u00a0is the independent regulator for credit unions.\u00a0 Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members. <\/p>  <p>  While it is important to distinguish this division of roles, it is equally important to recognise that both the Registrar of Credit Unions and I, as Minister for Finance, are working together for the safety of members' savings and the security of the credit union sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 (the Regulations) came into effect on 1 January 2016 following commencement of the remaining sections of the Credit Unions and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 which provided regulation making powers to the Central Bank. These Regulations set out an individual member savings limit of &euro;100,000. The Regulations introduced on 1 January 2016 also provided that credit unions could apply to the Central Bank to retain individual members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000, which were held at commencement of the Regulations and that Credit unions with total assets in excess of &euro;100m could apply to the Central Bank for approval to increase individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank have informed me that it is their duty to ensure that actions taken represent the best overall outcome, from the perspective of ensuring the protection of members' funds by credit unions and safeguarding the stability of the sector. A maximum individual member's savings limit of &euro;100,000 ensures the protection of members' savings and continue to ensure that credit unions' funding is sufficiently diversified and is not dependent on a small number of members. This cap is based on the savings amount protected under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme and would therefore ensure that no member of a credit union would lose any of their savings in the event of a resolution. It is aimed at protecting members' savings and also at protecting the financial stability of the sector, given the wider potential negative impact on the sector of any credit union member losing some of their savings.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank have further informed me that in relation to concerns raised regarding competition, they have been provided with specific regulation making powers by the Oireachtas in relation to credit unions. Where the Central Bank regulates one category of regulated entity by imposing specific regulatory requirements which may be different to those imposed on other categories of regulated entities, this simply reflects the nature of the distinct categories of entities involved. As in other areas of the regulatory framework, this limit takes account of the nature, scale and complexity of credit unions and is considered appropriate by the Central Bank at this time given the current credit union business model.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has responsibility for enforcing Irish and EU competition law.

No. 16863\/17). <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to progressing the development of a dynamic and innovative education system that reflects the diversity of twenty-first Century Ireland.  The Programme for a Partnership Government reflects the Government&rsquo;s objective of strengthening parental choice and further expanding diversity in our school system.  The desire of parents for diversity in education is primarily being pursued by increasing the number of non-denominational and multi-denominational schools with a view to reaching 400 by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that on the 30th January, 2017, I  announced new plans aimed at providing more multi-denominational and non-denominational schools across the country, in line with the choices of families and school communities and the Programme for Government commitment in this area.<\/p>  <p>  This will involve the Education and Training Boards in the initial phase, as the State&rsquo;s local education authorities, identifying areas where there is likely to be demand for greater diversity and they will work with pre-school services to establish evidence of this demand among the cohort of pre-school parents.  There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons\/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity.<\/p>  <p>  Each ETB will then prepare a report for the Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.  The location of these schools is therefore unlikely to become available until after the reports have been submitted.<\/p>  <p>  In the subsequent implementation phase, where the level of demand for multidenominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that.  There will be a role for the existing patron\/landowner in consulting with local community and school interests and taking into account proposals from different prospective multi-denominational patrons.  It is envisaged that transfers will largely be by way of voluntary transfer of live schools by existing patrons.<\/p>  <p>  While these new structures are being introduced, my Department will continue to work with the main stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified, in 2017 and beyond.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to progressing the reconfiguration of existing school provision to provide greater choice to parents in areas of stable population, the Government is committed to ensuring that parental preferences will continue to be key to patronage decisions on new schools established in areas of demographic growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500076#WRJ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Data","counter":299,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500076#WRJ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":300,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[16843\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500076#WRJ01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the way under the new model for allocation of resource teaching hours in primary and secondary schools children who received diagnoses in the school year 2016-2017 will receive resource teaching hours from September 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. <\/p><p>No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils\u00a0by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. <\/p><p>An\u00a0additional 900 teaching posts\u00a0have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional\u00a0teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. <\/p><p>The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1,000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government.  The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation\u00a0of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support.\u00a0<\/p><p>Under the new allocation model, schools\u00a0will be\u00a0provided with a total allocation which includes\u00a0a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school&rsquo;s profile. <\/p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school. <\/p><p>Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will\u00a0reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p><p>Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours\u00a0may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis,\u00a0as schools will now receive\u00a0a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.<\/p><p>The new allocations to schools will include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including\u00a0where\u00a0a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or\u00a0where there are\u00a0newly\u00a0enrolling pupils\u00a0to the school.<\/p><p>All allocations to schools include a supplementary provision, which has been referred to as the &lsquo;baseline allocation&rsquo; which is allocated over and above the profiled allocation. <\/p><p>For students who start school from September 2017, with a specific diagnosis, either in junior infants or transferring from another school, the resources they need will already be in the school under the new model. \u00a0<\/p><p>It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students\u00a0with additional teaching needs will\u00a0leave and others will\u00a0enrol, broadly balancing the school profile.  Resources allocated under this model will not normally\u00a0be adjusted between allocations. <\/p><p>The NCSE\u00a0has published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: <i>www.ncse.ie<\/i>. <\/p><p>Schools were asked to submit appeals\u00a0by March 31st 2017.The appeal process will consider\u00a0whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017\/18 allocation.<\/p><p>DES Circulars 0013\/2017 and 0014\/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools. \u00a0<\/p><p>The model\u00a0will\u00a0allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances\u00a0or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very\u00a0substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.

The central vision of the Plan is that the Irish Education and Training System should become the best in Europe over the next decade.  The Plan&rsquo;s high-level goals are based on the five policy areas which I believe will help us to achieve this ambition. The goals are:<\/p>  <p>  1. Improve the learning experience and the success of learners<\/p>  <p>  2. Improve the progress of learners at risk of educational disadvantage or learners with special educational needs<\/p>  <p>  3. Help those delivering education services to continuously improve<\/p>  <p>  4. Build stronger bridges between education and wider community<\/p>  <p>  5. Improve national planning and support services<\/p>  <p>  The basic aim of this Government is to sustain our economic progress and use it to build a fair and compassionate society.  Education is the best means of delivering a fairer society, breaking down cycles of disadvantage and ensuring that all our people, in particular those with special educational needs, are able to participate in that progress and fulfil their potential.  Excellent and innovative education and training are the pivot around which personal fulfilment, a fair society and a successful nation should revolve.\u00a0 It is central to sustaining economic success and in converting economic success into building a strong community.  Having the best education and training service in Europe will allow us to provide better opportunities for more people from disadvantaged groups, as well as ensuring that we create more sustainable well-paying jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Our approach to special education has undergone a huge transformation with a growing proportion of children with special educational needs being educated with their peers in mainstream schools.\u00a0\u00a0The participation and progress of learners with special educational needs across the whole education system remains a key focus with an emphasis on improving whole-school and whole system approaches.  The Action Plan 2017 sets out a range of measures which will be undertaken during this year.  These include allocating teachers to schools under the new allocation model to support children with special educational needs, publishing the outcomes of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme, and consult with partners on the implementation of sections of the EPSEN Act and on the provision of services to children with Down Syndrome. <\/p>  <p>  Quality of provision is the cornerstone to the success of the education and training system.\u00a0 We recognise the fundamental roles that leaders, teachers and support staff play and we want to strengthen the system&rsquo;s capacity to continuously improve and to deliver the highest quality education and training services for learners.  The Action Plan 2017 details actions which will ensure that leadership, management, quality frameworks, teaching methods, and initial and continuing training are all operating to the highest standards across the continuum of education and training provision.  These actions include expanding the range of supports available through the Centre for School Leadership, providing dedicated professional support to teachers to support the implementation of curricular and policy change, and developing and introducing a new postgraduate qualification for aspiring school leaders.<\/p>  <p>  To become an innovation leader and to build a strong talent base, we as a nation must effectively engage with enterprise.  We must work to address identified skills needs in critical areas, and recognise the shifting global economic and political climate in which services are delivered and jobs are created.\u00a0 Successful enterprise engagement is the foundation of much of the planned activity detailed in the Action Plan 2017.  This includes driving the growth of traineeships and apprenticeships, ensuring the relevance of work placements and work-based projects, and increasing the diversity of opportunity in learning beyond school.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that progress is made in all of these areas, including helping children with special needs, supporting schools and building a stronger bridge between education and the workplace, updated annual Action Plans will be published each year, detailing the actions that will be implemented during that year.  As part of this process, actions will be monitored against published timelines and progress reports will be published on a quarterly basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500077#WRK00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"DEIS Scheme","counter":340,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500077#WRK00950"},{"type":"question","counter":341,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[16856\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500077#WRK01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the stage at which the review of the school support programme through the DEIS initiative is at; when this review will be completed and published; if he envisages any changes to the funding or delivery model of the DEIS programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[16858\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500077#WRK01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the new national action plan for education inclusion will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 157 together.<\/p><p>I refer to my response of 1 March 2017, when I informed the Deputy that the review of DEIS has been completed and the new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion entitled 'DEIS Plan 2017' was published, together with a report of the review, on 13 February 2017. <\/p><p>A copy of both reports, 'Report of the Review of DEIS' and ' DEIS Plan 2017' are available on my Department's website -\u00a0<i><\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500077#WRK01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Curriculum","counter":344,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500077#WRK01250"},{"type":"question","counter":345,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[16857\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500077#WRK01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to provide new courses in the leaving certificate, such as coding, physical education and politics; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":346,"content":"<p>My Department has committed to enriching teaching and learning with new curricula, in the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019.

Collective agreements reached between the Government and the public service unions provided vital industrial peace during this very difficult period for the State.<\/p><p>The Lansdowne Road Agreement has allowed a programme of restoration to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers. <\/p><p>I accept that ASTI members had outstanding pay demands and that the deal did not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.\u00a0 However, it has restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and delivers full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced services for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for higher education and for apprenticeships.  The door remains open to the trade union movement seeking to advance this issue further in the context of future public service pay talks.<\/p><p>In education, there is a well-established increment system.  Teachers are not paid equally. For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching.  Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods.  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission.<\/p><p>Following discussions, the Teachers Conciliation Council published a set of proposals in November for consideration by ASTI members aimed at finding a resolution to their dispute. <\/p><p>The proposals provided ASTI members with an opportunity to benefit from the programme of pay restoration I mentioned above, including the agreement reached with TUI and INTO, which will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers. <\/p><p>In addition, there were other immediate undoubted benefits for individual ASTI members in accepting the proposals including:<\/p><p>- Avoiding an increment freeze<\/p><p>- Inclusion of the S&amp;amp;S allowance of &euro;1,592 into the pay scale<\/p><p>- Continued alleviation of the FEMPI Act pay reductions<\/p><p>- The Ward Report measures and a revised sequence for filling posts\u00a0which enable fixed-term and part-time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more easily and quickly than before<\/p><p>- An increase in the quantum of the Croke Park hours that can be\u00a0worked on other than a whole-school basis<\/p><p>- A review of the usage of the Croke Park hours<\/p><p>- Protection against compulsory redundancy<\/p><p>- The &euro;1,000 increase now being paid to public servants on 1 April 2017, brought forward from 1 September 2017 under the LRA.<\/p><p>ASTI members have voted\u00a0to reject the proposals put forward aimed at resolving their dispute and in consequence, to reject the Lansdowne Road Agreement. It is regrettable that many ASTI members will now suffer permanent financial losses and loss of other benefits as a result of this choice.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The proposals represented the final outcome of the process and there will be no further offer made to ASTI.

The designation of any performance in the certificate examinations as a 'fail' ceased in 1968. <\/p>  <p>  The nature of curricular examinations such as the Leaving Certificate and the procedures currently in place for awarding grades are such that a certain amount of fluctuation in the grade distribution from year to year is to be expected.  Grade distributions are also affected significantly by the proportion of candidates who opt to take the examination at each level.  In particular, if the proportion of candidates opting for Higher level increases, the candidates making this move will tend to be those who were towards the higher achieving end of the Ordinary level distribution and will tend to fall at the lower achieving end of the Higher level distribution. This will obviously affect the grade distribution at both levels. Influenced by the combined effect of syllabus change in mathematics,\u00a0known as Project Maths, and the introduction by the Higher Education Institutions of 'bonus points' for Higher level mathematics, the number of students in recent years presenting for Higher level in Leaving Certificate Mathematics examinations has increased significantly, from 15.8% in 2011 to 28% in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  During the standard-setting process that happens as part of the marking process each year, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) takes account of these and any other relevant factors in the course of satisfying itself that the distribution of grades awarded is appropriate and that it accurately reflects the performance of the candidates in comparison to the achievement standards envisaged when the syllabus was designed.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of a significant migration of mathematics candidates from Ordinary to Higher level, it may be noted that a similar absolute number of candidates awarded E, F or no grade at Ordinary level will inevitably be manifested as a higher percentage, since the total number of candidates at this level has reduced.<\/p>  <p>  The number of candidates who failed to achieve at least a D3 grade at any level of the mathematics examination in 2016, while marginally higher than in the last three or four years, is very similar to the number in the years before that (2009 to 2011, for example).  In the context of the factors mentioned above, there is nothing especially unusual about the grade distribution in mathematics for 2016.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the current syllabus change in mathematics, there has been a deliberate attempt to increase the emphasis on higher-order thinking skills, including interpretation, problem solving, and dealing with the unfamiliar.  These are skills that students find difficult to master and teachers find difficult to instil in students.  The syllabus expectations are ambitious at all levels. <\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) will be undertaking a review of the Project Maths initiative, now that the full implementation of all phases of the curricular change is complete.  By this time, students will have been through the new mathematics cycle a few times and the NCCA will have good information on which to base the assessment of its impact, especially on the learning of under-achievers.  I have asked the SEC to ensure that any lessons that can be learned from candidate performance in recent examinations, and the 2016 examination in particular, be fed into that review process.

It will be important to obtain political and societal consensus on achieving a sustainable funding model for the higher education sector in the future and my Department and I continue to work with the committee as it undertakes its deliberations.<\/p>  <p>  In\u00a0follow-up to the Expert Group report, appropriate technical work will be\u00a0undertaken by an inter-Departmental group chaired by my Department in relation to income contingent student loans in order to inform future funding policy options, including in light of recommendations from the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  Increased\u00a0Exchequer funding of &euro;36.5 million was secured in Budget 2017 for the higher education sector.\u00a0 This includes an increase in the funding available to students from disadvantaged backgrounds and other under-represented groups to assist them in overcoming financial barriers to accessing and completing higher education. \u00a0Provision is also being made in the Department's expenditure ceiling in 2018 and 2019 for demographic increases which cumulatively represents an additional &euro;160 million investment in the sector over the period 2017-2019.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform\u00a0are currently undertaking a public consultation process on a proposed Exchequer-Employer investment mechanism for higher education and further education and training.  It is estimated that the mechanism,\u00a0which proposes an increase in\u00a0the National Training Fund levy from 0.7% to 1% between 2018 and 2020, could yield close to an additional &euro;200m\u00a0revenue in 2020.  Comments on the proposal may be submitted to the Departments of Education and Skills and Public Expenditure and Reform by 5 p.m. on Thursday 13th April 2017.  Full details of the consultation process are available on the websites of both Departments. <\/p>  <p>  The intention is that, taken together, these approaches will contribute to and inform the\u00a0development of a long-term sustainable funding model for the higher education and further education and training sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500078#WRL03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Recruitment","counter":394,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500079#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":395,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[16877\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500079#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the shortage of substitute teachers for primary schools and the difficulties this is causing for school principals and managers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":396,"content":"<p>In overall terms my Department does not have evidence of a recent or current general shortage of\u00a0primary teachers, including for substitute positions. \u00a0However, I am aware that some schools are experiencing difficulty in recruiting substitute teachers, and I am committed to examining all possible means of addressing this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of my Department's policy is to achieve a balance between the supply of, and demand for, teachers.

I also met the Minister of State for Exiting the EU, David Jones, the UK&rsquo;s Opposition Spokesperson on Brexit, Kier Starmer, as well as members of the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain.

The Council immediately began work on a call for proposals for the development of new enterprise-led apprenticeships.\u00a0 The call issued in January 2015 and over 80 proposals were received from industry stakeholders working with education and training providers. <\/p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Council has been working with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them in sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis. The first of these new apprenticeships commenced recently with the launch of the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship in September 2016 and the new Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship\u00a0in November 2016.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Three further apprenticeships in the manufacturing area have also recently\u00a0completed validation and approval.\u00a0\u00a0Employers in those areas, including those in the Kildare region, will be able to recruit apprentices to these programmes shortly.\u00a0 Ten\u00a0further new apprenticeships are due to launch later this year in various sectors including financial services, hospitality and ICT and a pipeline of new apprenticeships is in place for subsequent years.\u00a0 This pipeline will be refreshed through the launch of a new call for proposals later this month.<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0have also\u00a0launched an Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020, which sets out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period. The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year. Over the lifetime of the Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes which represents a doubling of current activity. <\/p>  <p>  Registrations in the 27 craft apprenticeship trades are rising strongly as the employment and economic situation improves and\u00a0I welcome that employers throughout the country are engaging strongly with the apprenticeship system.\u00a0 In 2015 there were 3,153 registrations in existing apprenticeships which represented a 17% increase on the previous year. In 2016 there were 3,742 new registrations in craft apprenticeships, 182 of which were taken on in the Kildare region. This year the strong growth in new registrations continues with 893 apprentices registered at the end of February, 48 of which are in Kildare. Current forecasts are that annual registrations will increase to 4,147 in 2017 and 4,697 in 2018.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A\u00a0campaign to promote apprenticeship is currently being developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners, including the Apprenticeship Council. The campaign will raise awareness and promote the values of apprenticeship for individual apprentices and for employers and it will cover both existing apprenticeships and the new apprenticeships now coming on stream.<\/p>  <p>  On a broader note a number of strategies have been developed by the education and training system at all levels to meet existing and future skills demands in the workplace. Last year my Department published the National Skills Strategy 2025 and the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019 both of which contain over 100 actions designed to see the system become the best in Europe over the next decade. Some of these actions are specifically aimed at ensuring that the labour force\u00a0has access to education and training provision that equips them with the skills that enterprise needs, now and in the future.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, as part of the National Skills Strategy 2025, nine Regional Skills Fora, including one in the Mid-East covering County Kildare, were established.\u00a0The Mid-East Regional Skills Forum has identified a number of sectors including the agrifood film\/audio visual, construction, hospitality, manufacturing and the equine sectors where there are skills needs. In order to address these skills needs the Forum has, and will continue to engage with relevant stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500079#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Summer Works Scheme Applications","counter":406,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500079#WRM01400"},{"type":"question","counter":407,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[16932\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500079#WRM01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide an update on the summer works scheme application from a school (details supplied); when decisions on applications for the summer works scheme will be returned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":408,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy\u00a0that the current Summer Works Scheme (SWS)\u00a0is being applied on a multi-annual basis for the years 2016 and 2017.

The Council immediately began work on a call for proposals for the development of new enterprise-led apprenticeships.  The call issued in January 2015 and over 80 proposals were received from industry stakeholders working with education and training providers.<\/p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Council has been working with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them in sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis. The first of these new apprenticeships commenced recently with the launch of the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship in September 2016 and the new Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship\u00a0in November 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Three further apprenticeships in the manufacturing area have also recently\u00a0completed validation and approval.  Employers in those areas, including those in the Kildare region, will be able to recruit apprentices to these programmes shortly.  Ten\u00a0further new apprenticeships are due to launch later this year in various sectors including financial services, hospitality and ICT and a pipeline of new apprenticeships is in place for subsequent years.  This pipeline will be refreshed through the launch of a new call for proposals later this month.<\/p>  <p>  I have also\u00a0launched an Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020, which sets out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period. The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year. Over the lifetime of the Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes which represents a doubling of current activity.<\/p>  <p>  Registrations in the 27 craft apprenticeship trades are rising strongly as the employment and economic situation improves and\u00a0I welcome that employers throughout the country are engaging strongly with the apprenticeship system.  In 2015 there were 3,153 registrations in existing apprenticeships which represented a 17% increase on the previous year.  In 2016 there were 3,742 new registrations in craft apprenticeships, 182 of which were taken on in the Kildare region.  This year the strong growth in new registrations continues with 893 apprentices registered at the end of February, 48 of which are in Kildare. Current forecasts are that annual registrations will increase to 4,147 in 2017 and 4,697 in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  A\u00a0campaign to promote apprenticeship is currently being developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners, including the Apprenticeship Council. The campaign will raise awareness and promote the values of apprenticeship for individual apprentices and for employers and it will cover both existing apprenticeships and the new apprenticeships now coming on stream.<\/p>  <p>  On a broader note a number of strategies have been developed by the education and training system at all levels to meet existing and future skills demands in the workplace. Last year my Department published the National Skills Strategy 2025 and the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019 both of which contain over 100 actions designed to see the system become the best in Europe over the next decade. Some of these actions are specifically aimed at ensuring that the labour force\u00a0has access to education and training provision that equips them with the skills that enterprise needs, now and in the future.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, as part of the National Skills Strategy 2025, nine Regional Skills Fora, including one in the Mid-East covering County Kildare, were established. The Mid-East Regional Skills Forum has identified a number of sectors including the agrifood film\/audio visual, construction, hospitality, manufacturing and the equine sectors where there are skills needs. In order to address these skills needs the Forum has, and will continue to engage with relevant stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500080#WRN01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Data","counter":448,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500080#WRN01450"},{"type":"question","counter":449,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[17132\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500080#WRN01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to set down the number of extra teachers who have taken up employment at primary and second level over the past 12 months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":450,"content":"<p>The\u00a0number of additional teaching Staff (Full-time Equivalent Posts ) allocated\u00a0in the past twelve months to primary schools was 1,224 and 1,150 to post primary schools.

NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.

In light of this, and the commitment to providing a successor Programme to SICAP when the current Programme comes to an end on 31 December this year, my Department is leading out on a number of actions\u00a0which will\u00a0lead to\u00a0a better understanding of SICAP and its impacts, and which will inform my Department in reshaping the next iteration of SICAP. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is holding a targeted national consultation process which will assist in the design of the next programme.  The consultation process, which I have been leading, consists of national and regional sessions and a number of focus groups in which feedback is being sought from the key stakeholders involved.  The consultation process offers a platform to consider how the\u00a0programme can be refined and for solutions to be put forward in order to strengthen the programme\u00a0from 2018. In addition,\u00a0the ESRI has begun a qualitative study looking at SICAP goals and its governance structure as part of a\u00a0wider evaluation project. <\/p>  <p>  There will also\u00a0be a qualitative research project looking at a cohort of SICAP participants - young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs) - carried out by an external provider in 2017.  This research will examine how SICAP&rsquo;s Programme Implementers identify and engage with this\u00a0target group, look at\u00a0the types of outcomes being achieved for them, and put forward good practice examples to inform the next iteration of the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500081#WRO03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management","counter":487,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500082#WRP00150"},{"type":"question","counter":488,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[16936\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500082#WRP00200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the potential health risks associated with dog breeding establishments spreading dog faeces on tillage fields; and his plans to cease this public health hazard.","asker":"1291","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":489,"content":"<p>The holding, transport or management of waste is a matter for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and I have no function in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500082#WRP00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":490,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500082#WRP00350"},{"type":"question","counter":491,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[16937\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500082#WRP00400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on whether the current regime in planning effectively allows developers a free hand once planning permission is granted, without any meaningful prospect of sanction by either removing an unauthorised construction or applying for retention permission, in the event of planning violations, breaches of planning permission in particular or of planning law in general; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":492,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[16938\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500082#WRP00500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on enforcement as an aspect to the planning process; his further views on the desirability of funding the following activities (details supplied) money spent on the following to be money well spent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":493,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 212 and 213 together.<\/p>  <p>  My role, as Minister, in relation to the planning system is mainly to provide and update the legislative and policy guidance framework. The legislative framework comprises the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, (the Act) and the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  With regards to policy guidance,\u00a0my Department has issued a large number of planning guidelines (available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.housing.gov.ie) under section 28 of the Act, to which planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are obliged to have regard in the exercise of their planning functions.  The day-to-day operation of the planning system is, however, a matter for the planning authorities.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under planning legislation, enforcement of planning control is a matter for the relevant planning authority which can take action if a development does not have the required permission, or where the terms of a permission have not been met.  Under section 30 of the Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including an enforcement issue, with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned. <\/p>  <p>  There are extensive enforcement provisions provided for in Part VIII of the\u00a0Act, with a view to ensuring that works pertaining to permitted developments are carried out in accordance with the planning permission granted and any associated conditions and that no unauthorised development takes place.  If a person is of the view that any development works being undertaken are not in compliance with the permission granted or are unauthorised, s\/he may make a written complaint to the relevant planning authority who shall investigate the matter and take any appropriate enforcement action, including, where necessary, the seeking of a Court order requiring that the development is carried out in conformity with the planning permission and any condition pertaining to that permission.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  If an enforcement notice is not complied with, the planning authority may itself take the specified steps and recover the expense incurred in doing so.  A planning authority may also seek a Court order under section 160 of the Act, requiring any particular action to be done or not to be done.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In May 2013, a Ministerial Policy Directive was issued to all planning authorities, reminding them of\u00a0their statutory obligations under Part VIII of the\u00a0Act relating to enforcement.  The Directive required that planning authorities ensure that sufficient and appropriate human resources are made available for\u00a0enforcement purposes. It also required planning authorities to undertake appropriate monitoring of planning enforcement and directed them to prioritise large-scale unauthorised development and enforcement cases.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that planning authorities have sufficient enforcement powers at their disposal under the existing legislation.

Within the IUKA Division, there is a Brexit-specific policy co-ordination function now in place and there are teams focused on Northern Ireland and on wider British-Irish Relations whose core duties include Brexit-related issues.  In addition, a number of officers of my Department are seconded to the Department of the Taoiseach and working on EU matters, while two officers are seconded to the International and EU Relations Division of the Department of Finance.<\/p>  <p>  Many business units of my Department at headquarters in Dublin are involved in some way as part of the response to the UK exit, for example, the Legal Division, the Trade Division and the Policy Planning Unit.  There is also an intra-Departmental senior management group focusing on issues relating to the UK exit, chaired by the Secretary General and comprising senior officials from across all relevant business units of the Department.  Overseas, specific additional posts dedicated to issues relating to the UK exit have been assigned to our Embassies in London, Berlin, and Paris as well as the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels, which has a unit dedicated to managing our response to this issue.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that these exit negotiations will be complex and intensive.  To support the negotiation process, my Department received an additional &euro;3.2 million as part of the 2017 allocation.

Periodic and non-periodic employee contributions made by deduction from salary (or from any gratuities payable) formed an integral part of the scheme, as was evident from the title of the scheme.

I want to ensure that existing GP services are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly qualified GPs.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government commits to increasing the number of GP training places to 259 places annually.  In July 2016, the GP training intake increased from 157 to 172 places and the HSE's 2017 National Service Plan envisages a further increase, to 187 places this year.  I am anxious to achieve further increases in future years in order to ensure that the future manpower needs of general practice can be met.<\/p>  <p>  Further efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practicing GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible\/shared GMS\/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices.  These steps should help to address the future demand for GPs by enticing GPs who may have ceased practicing for family or other reasons back into the workforce, facilitating GPs to work past the standard retirement age and encouraging more GPs to work in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I have repeatedly emphasised the need for a new GP services contract which will help modernise our health service and develop a strengthened primary care sector, and health service management have already progressed a number of significant measures through engagement with GP representatives in recent years.  The next phase of engagement on a new GP contract is under way.  I am keen to ensure that future contractual terms for GPs would enjoy the support of the broad community of GPs and in this regard officials from my Department and the HSE are engaging with the relevant GP representative bodies in relation to the wide range of matters which will need to be encompassed by the contract development process.  The GP contracts review process will, among other things, seek to introduce further measures aimed at making general practice a fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future.<\/p>  <p>  As the issues raised in relation to Tipperary relate to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500088#WRV01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":673,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[16974\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500088#WRV01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when GP access to diagnostics will be extended to a provider in south Tipperary (details supplied); the reason the evaluation of this service was only carried out for two weeks, which was insufficient to realise the real benefits of this service; when the evaluation of this service will be concluded; when the service will be provided to persons in County Tipperary helping to relieve capacity pressures at South Tipperary General Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":674,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500088#WRV01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts Data","counter":675,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500088#WRV01400"},{"type":"question","counter":676,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[16986\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500088#WRV01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of private investigation firms hired by statutory agencies and or semi-State bodies under the aegis of his Department in the past five years to date in 2017; the names of the firms; the amount they were paid; if they supplied his Department with a report on completion of their work; if he will provide copies of reports submitted to him from these firms as a result of his engagement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":677,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to reports from private investigation firms submitted to the Department from statutory agencies under the aegis of this Department is not immediately available.

Aggravated congestion occurs when the number of vehicles on a part of the network is higher than the network can handle and the point at which serious traffic delays arise.  The first phase of the project, which is currently being finalised estimates the annual value of time lost to road users due to aggravated congestion in the greater Dublin area.  The study uses data from a variety of sources to estimate activity on the network including census travel to work data, NTA GDA surveys, car ownership data and CSO small area population statistics.  The project has been carried out in conjunction with the National Transport Authority, NTA, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and Dublin City Council, DCC, with particular support from the NTA's modelling team in producing the modelled outputs.  <\/p>  <p>  A final project report will be published on my Department's website in the coming weeks.

These have been orientated to reflect an increased focus on EU markets.\u00a0 Enterprise Ireland is consistently working with client companies focussing\u00a0on enhancing their competitiveness, capability and levels of innovation to assist them to diversify into new markets. <\/p>  <p>  The EU's suite of Free Trade Agreements with third Countries help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish firms. \u00a0These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be important for Ireland. \u00a0With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the EU's ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements giving Irish firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries.\u00a0 The EU-Canada Free Trade Agreement will create sizeable new market access opportunities in services and investment in many sectors for Irish firms.\u00a0 My Department is already working with our agencies and Business Groups to ensure that Irish firms take early advantage of the terms of the Agreement.\u00a0 I will be <\/p>  <p>  leading a trade mission to Canada in the first half of this year to promote the opportunities provided by the Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  The EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement has led to a sizeable increase in Irish exports since it came into effect in 2011. \u00a0This is the real evidence that Trade Agreements work for Irish exporters and Irish jobs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500094#WRBB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Action Plan for Jobs","counter":847,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500094#WRBB02600"},{"type":"question","counter":848,"qnumday":344,"qnumall":"[16918\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500094#WRBB02700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if her plans to encourage an even dispersal of investment throughout rural Ireland and in counties Sligo and Leitrim are on target in view of the necessity to achieve an evenly based balanced economy with equal opportunities throughout; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":849,"content":"<p>The Regional Action Plan initiative is working to address regional and rural job creation by bringing different stakeholders in each of the 8 regions together to identify innovative and practical actions, to be taken across a range of Departments and agencies, with clear timelines for delivery over the period 2015 - 2017. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The plans are currently being monitored and driven in each region by Implementation Committees, comprising representatives from the Enterprise Sector, as well as the Local Authorities, Enterprise Agencies, and other public bodies in the region. Collaboration between the private and the public sector has been a core element in each plan&rsquo;s development, and will be central to each plan&rsquo;s delivery. The first progress reports on these Plans were published in December showing that good progress is being made in their implementation.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A key objective of the plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the aim of having the unemployment rate of each region within one per cent of the national average.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The success of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs is crucial to the Government in meeting the ambition to create an additional 200,000 jobs, 135,000 of which are outside the Dublin region, by 2020. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Employment has been growing continuously for the past 17 quarters and over the past year employment has grown in all regions. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The most recent figures from the CSO also show that 70% of all jobs created in the past year were created outside Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  The enterprise agencies are making a significant contribution to employment in the regions - 61% of new jobs by Enterprise Ireland firms in 2016 were outside Dublin and 52% of new jobs by IDA firms in 2016 were outside Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  The North East\/North West Regional Action Plan for Jobs is stimulating job creation across the region,\u00a0 by facilitating collaborative initiatives between the public and private sector, and through the provision of new competitive funds awarded through Enterprise Ireland, to support regional enterprise projects. <\/p>  <p>  The North East\/North West Plan aims to support the creation of 28,000 jobs across Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth by 2020.

Tusla has advised that there are 9 registered residential care centres in the Sligo\/Leitrim\/West Cavan area.  Children placed in these centres include children from other geographic locations, especially from the greater Dublin area.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla currently has 1,467 WTE social workers and an end of 2017 target of 1,520 WTE.  This target is short of the target set in Survival to Sustainability by approximately 100 WTE and reflects the constraints of the social work labour supply.  Funding is in place to address the issue of unallocated cases, however, the recruitment environment for social workers is very challenging.  However, Tusla is also focusing on intervening at an early stage of a family difficulty through social care and family supports.  Accordingly, Tusla is prioritising the recruitment of an additional 100 Family Support Practitioners, 166 social care staff and an additional 25 administrative staff to allow social workers to focus on their core work with children and their families. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500095#WRCC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection","counter":879,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500095#WRCC01850"},{"type":"question","counter":880,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[16903\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500095#WRCC01900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the resources available to her Department to meet the anticipated demands of children at risk here, especially in counties Sligo and Leitrim; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":881,"qnumday":356,"qnumall":"[16905\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500095#WRCC02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the average time taken to investigate cases of children at risk of the various forms of abuse; the degree to which a systemic response is in place to deal with such issues here, and especially in counties Sligo and Leitrim; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":882,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 354 and 356 together.<\/p>  <p>  Children First National Guidance (2011) gives advice for notifying Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, of situations where abuse is suspected.  A range of professionals including teachers, nurses, early years educators, Garda&iacute; and other health professionals, who see children regularly, are in a good position to identify children at risk.  Where someone has reasonable grounds for suspecting a child is being, or has been, abused, they are expected to immediately contact Tusla.  The Children First Act, 2015, once it is fully commenced, will place a statutory obligation on key professionals (mandated persons) to report concerns of harm above a defined threshold to Tusla without delay.  It is my intention that these provisions will be commenced by the end of 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The latest breakdown of referrals available relate to quarter 3, 2016 and there was a total of 181 referrals received in the Sligo\/Leitrim\/West Cavan administrative area during that period.  Each referral received by Tusla is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team.  Approximately 60% of referrals to Tusla are of a child welfare concern with the remaining 40% related to child protection concerns.  Tusla's policy is to refer child welfare referrals to relevant family and community support services.  At any stage, if a determination is made that there is abuse, whether physical, emotional, sexual or neglect, from which there is an ongoing risk of significant harm, the child protection pathway is followed.  In a minority of cases this may lead to the child being placed on the Child Protection Notification System (CPNS) or the child being received into care.  At the end of 2016, there was a total of 42 children listed as active on the CPNS in the Sligo\/Leitrim\/West Cavan area. <\/p>  <p>  At the end of January 2017, there were 101 children in care in the Sligo\/Leitrim\/West Cavan administrative area.

Children placed in these centres include children from other geographic locations, especially from the greater Dublin area.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla provides me with information on a monthly and quarterly basis outlining the increasing demands for their services, and how they are dealing with children awaiting services.  This information provides me with the information needed to assess how well we are supporting vulnerable children.

Tusla is currently engaged in the second year of a three year recruitment programme to expand the cohort of social workers, social care workers and business support staff.   I have secured additional funding for Tusla to enable this to happen and the current and capital Exchequer funding provided for Tusla is some &euro;713 million in 2017. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500095#WRCC02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":884,"qnumday":355,"qnumall":"[16904\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500095#WRCC02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the support services available to children who may be at risk as result of being undocumented non-nationals here with special regards to counties Sligo and Leitrim; the measures taken to protect such children; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":885,"content":"<p>The Child Care Act, 1991 applies to all children resident in the State, irrespective of their immigration status.

While the vote does not give rise to fundamental strategic issues for Defence Forces operations or for Ireland&rsquo;s continuing engagement within the EU in the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), it is expected that Brexit will have an impact on future developments in the Defence sphere.<\/p>  <p>  The structures put in place in the Department of Defence to address the potential challenges arising from Brexit include the assignment of responsibility to a senior official at Assistant Secretary General level in relation to Brexit related matters. The senior official is leading the Department&rsquo;s input to deliberations within the framework established across Government and is supported in their role by a number of branches in the Department. The senior official represents the Department on the Interdepartmental Group on EU-UK Affairs which is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and is engaged with the identification of key strategic, operational and policy issues arising from Brexit. In addition, the Management Board is acting as a clearing house for Brexit and maintains oversight on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, the Government has adopted a contingency framework to deal with all issues arising in respect of the UK vote to leave the EU. Accordingly, any issues arising, including those within the Defence area, whether bilateral, or in respect of developments in CSDP, or regarding our wider international multilateral defence engagements, will be also addressed within that framework.<\/p>  <p>  As matters relating to Brexit are currently being absorbed and dealt with within already existing Department structures and resources, there is currently no dedicated Brexit funding allocation in the Department of Defence. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware the UK triggered Article 50 on 29 March 2017 and a meeting of Heads of State and Government is scheduled to take place on 29 April to discuss the UK withdrawal. It is expected that formal negotiations will commence in May or June, once the remaining 27 member States reach consensus on the EU's negotiating position. The negotiations themselves can then be expected to take at least two years to complete and all potential consequences in the defence sphere, arising during the negotiations, will remain the subject of ongoing consideration by my Department throughout this process, including whether there will be a future requirement for a dedicated unit to exclusively handle Brexit related matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040500096#WRDD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"}]
