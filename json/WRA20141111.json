The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2014, which I will bring before the House this Thursday, will provide the legislative basis for some of these measures, including:<\/p><p>- Risk equalisation credits (based on age, gender and level of cover) payable in respect of members aged 60 and over.<\/p><p>- The Hospital Bed Utilisation Credit which acts as a proxy for health status, is increased from &euro;60 a night to &euro;90 and is payable in respect of overnight stays for all ages.

Separately, I have decided to reduce the levy which insurers pay to meet the running costs of the Health Insurance Authority.  A nominal rate of just 0.01% of insurers' premium income will apply for two years, resulting in savings for the insurance companies of &euro;2m for each of these years.

This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event.  Implementation of the policy across all health and social services has now commenced by the HSE.  At the recent Patient Safety First Conference last Friday, 7th November, the National Lead for Open Disclosure in the HSE advised that over 250 staff briefing sessions and 95 workshops have taken place to date.

An essential element of the eligibility arrangements is that the public or private status of a patient must be specified on admission to hospital.  <\/p><p>  Section 55 of the Health Act 1970 (as amended) also provides for the charging of private in-patients. Where a patient elects to be treated privately by a consultant the hospital must treat that patient as a private patient. Persons who opt to be private on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care. The hospital charge applicable depend on the hospital treating the patient and on whether a person is accommodated in a single or multiple occupancy room or on a day case basis. The application of a charge by a hospital for in-patient services is obligatory under the legislation, irrespective of whether the patient occupies a public designated bed or private designated bed, as it relates to the private service provided.<\/p><p>  The private in-patient charge goes towards meeting part of the cost of providing the hospital&rsquo;s services to private patients, for example, the cost of non-consultant doctors, nursing, diagnostic services (such as x-rays and other scans), laboratory services (such as blood tests etc.), medicines, and capital costs. <\/p><p>  In the case of a chemotherapy or dialysis patient, best practice is to treat him\/her in a seated or reclining position, on a therapy chair or a recliner, rather than on a bed. Treatment trolleys are routinely used in day surgery procedures such as colonoscopy.  It is therefore appropriate to charge for the private service provided.<\/p><p>  The private in-patient charges do not apply to patients receiving accident and emergency treatment.

Government has agreed that the Scheme will also include payments for the small number of women who have had a pubiotomy. The Scheme is designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial, and aims to minimise the stress for the women concerned. Many are elderly and may not want to experience the delay, publicity and financial risks that sometimes come with a court case.  I met all three support groups representing the women last September and their views have helped to shape the Scheme.<\/p><p>  Judge Maureen Harding Clark, a retired High Court Judge, will undertake the role of  independent Assessor to the Scheme. Judge Clark, from her previous work on the Lourdes Hospital Redress Scheme, brings valuable experience to the role of determining the appropriate level of award for each individual.<\/p><p>  The Symphysiotomy Scheme is open to women who are still living and who underwent a surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy in the State between the years 1940 and 1990. Awards of &euro;50,000, &euro;100,000 and &euro;150,000 will be offered. Women who have had a surgical symphysiotomy may accept an award of &euro;50,000.  For women who have had a symphysiotomy and have suffered significant disability a higher award of &euro;100,000 will be offered.  Where a woman has had a symphysiotomy immediately following Caesarean section an award of &euro;100,000 will be offered and where she has suffered significant disability following these procedures &euro;150,000 will be offered. For a woman who underwent a pubiotomy an award of &euro;100,000 will be offered and for women who have suffered significant disability following this procedure, &euro;150,000 will be offered. Details of the Terms of the Scheme and how to access application forms have been widely advertised.<\/p><p>  Awards will be exempt from tax and legislation is being put in place as a matter of urgency to ensure they are also exempt from being taken into consideration for means tested welfare schemes. The Judge expects to make payments to some women before Christmas.<\/p><p>  It is not a requirement for a woman to retain a Solicitor to make an application.  However, the Scheme makes provision for applicants to have legal and other advice available to them in preparing to submit an application if they wish.  Judge Clark has assured me that if women have questions on any aspect of the Scheme,  her staff will be available to assist in any way possible.<\/p><p>  I would like to emphasise that women will not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition to participating in the Scheme. Women may opt out of the Scheme at any stage in the process, up to the time of accepting their award.  It is only on accepting the offer of an award that a woman must agree to discontinue her legal proceedings against any party arising out of a symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.<\/p><p>  Applications must be made within 20 working days of the Commencement Date.  The Closing Date for receipt of applications is therefore Friday 5 December 2014.  In exceptional circumstances, Judge Clark has discretion to extend the time for receipt of applications by an additional 20 working days, that is, to Wednesday, 14 January 2015.<\/p><p>  I hope the implementation of this Scheme will be of benefit to the women concerned and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100061#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alcohol Sales Legislation","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100061#WRD01550"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[39378\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100061#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"to set out his views on whether the off-trade market for the sale of alcohol is being distorted by anti-competitive practices; if he is considering new regulations to prevent below-cost selling of alcohol; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":169,"content":"<p>Addressing the price of alcohol is an important component of any long-term strategic approach to tackling alcohol misuse.

Improving the job\/candidate matching capability of this service is to incentivise employers to use the service to provide more jobs for those who are unemployed.  At present jobseekers can use the site to manually search for jobs however employers cannot use the service in the &lsquo;reverse&rsquo; direction to search for candidates. In addition there is no automatic matching of candidates\/jobs to present a shortlist of suitable opportunities to jobseekers or suitable candidates to employers.<br\/><br\/>Accordingly a tender process is currently underway for a new job matching system to replace\/upgrade JobsIreland. Subject to the outcome of the tender process it is anticipated that the new system will go live during 2015.  <br\/><br\/>In order to populate the new site with sufficiently detailed candidate profiles to enable employers match their job requirements with suitable candidates, jobseekers will be asked to upload their CVs on JobsIreland and other similar employment sites.  In addition to providing evidence to the Department that the jobseeker is genuinely seeking, and available for, employment this will bring benefits to the jobseeker as it will improve their chances of being &lsquo;matched&rsquo; with employers in three ways. First, the new Jobslreland service will itself automatically match candidate profiles with suitable jobs and will notify both the jobseeker and the employer of the match details. Second, employers will have the ability to refine the search parameters and conduct an &lsquo;advance&rsquo; search for job for candidates with specific skills, qualifications and\/or experience. Third, jobseekers will have a similar search capability and will, by examining matching results, be able to refine the presentation of their CV to maximise its likelihood of being identified as a match for particular job types.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that, unless otherwise specified by the jobseeker, candidate personal information, such as name and address, will not be visible to employers or other users.  Instead candidate ID numbers will be used and these will enable prospective employers to communicate with jobseekers using messaging functionality on the system.  In addition jobseekers will only be requested to upload their CV in circumstances where their case worker is of the opinion that it is appropriate to do so. In particular it is not intended that  jobseekers with significant barriers to employment, for example literacy problems, will be requested to upload their CV. Such jobseekers will, as is the practice at the moment, be referred to appropriate service interventions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100062#WRE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":215,"content":"<p>Question No. 163 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100062#WRE01850"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[42929\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100062#WRE01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to bring forward legislation to ensure that fathers' names are mandatory on all birth certificates.","asker":"1065","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":218,"content":"<p>The Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2014 was introduced in the Seanad in July 2014 and it has passed all stages in that House.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives and the reform measures introduced to date go somewhat toward that goal. To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing whether they are entitled to State pension contributory, and the level of any such entitlement.<br\/><br\/>Once over 16, the date a person enters into insurance is taken as the date used for averaging purposes in order to qualify for a State pension. <br\/><br\/>To qualify for a state pension a person must:<br\/><br\/>- have at least 520 paid contributions and<br\/><br\/>- satisfy a yearly average test (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid and\/or credited is required for a maximum rate pension, reduced rates may be paid at various levels where the yearly average is between 10 and 47).<br\/><br\/>The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 defines insurable employment as <i>&quot;employment such that a person, over the age of 16 years and under pensionable age, employed in that employment would be an employed contributor&quot;.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Once a person reaches pension age he\/she is no longer in insurable employment and therefore is not liable to pay PRSI contributions.  There are no provisions in legislation which allow a person to pay contributions beyond pension age.<br\/><br\/>The majority of those aged over 66 would not qualify for a higher rate of State pension contributory if PRSI was levied on their current income.  In many cases they are either in receipt of such a pension at the full rate, or they receive a pension which is not based on their PRSI record (e.g. a public service pension, or a State pension non-contributory). In many other cases, the additional contributions would not be sufficient to increase their yearly average above the threshold required for a higher rate of pension.<br\/><br\/>The introduction of a requirement for such people to pay PRSI on their income after 66 would not, therefore, be welcomed by the majority of pensioners.<br\/><br\/>In the longer term, by 2020, it is planned to introduce a total contributions approach to pension entitlement, replacing the current yearly average system, and issues such as longer working and incentives to encourage this will be considered as part of that reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100063#WRF02000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Applications","counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100063#WRF02050"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[43190\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100063#WRF02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will expedite an application for domiciliary care allowance and carer's allowance in respect of persons (details supplied) in County Kilkenny.","asker":"965","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":262,"content":"<p>The person concerned was notified on the 22<sup>nd<\/sup>October 2014 that her domiciliary care allowance application was successful and that the allowance has been awarded from 1st September 2014.

Eurostat monitor this role through documentation, including the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) inventory for Ireland, and through biennial dialogue visits. Eurostat are the ultimate arbiters on the classification of units in relation to EDP and other Government Finance Statistics.<\/p><p>  The market\/non-market test, as described in the ESA 2010, determines if a government controlled institutional unit is a market producer. To determine this, Irish Water or any other semi state company, must sell its products at an economically significant price which, in practice, would be assessed if the sales of the producer cover a majority of the production costs over a sustained multi-year period. The plausibility of the semi state operating as a market producer is also tested by assessing the level of sales dependent on government funding. In the case of a new public enterprise, the classification will be based on the business plan and special attention will be given to check whether the unit becomes a market producer in a short period of time. The market status of government controlled institutional units is assessed on a regular basis.<\/p><p>  As per standard accruals accounting all billed sales will count towards revenue. If in the future bad debts are written off Irish Water may require new revenue streams to make up the shortfall.

No cases of contaminated petrol have been identified as a result of these checks from June 2014 to date.<\/p><p>  Motorists themselves should take care about where they source their petrol and should report any suspicions to Revenue.\u00a0 Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website specifically dealing with the shadow economy and this includes a reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices including the adulteration of fuel.<\/p><p>  Petrol stretching is an offence under section 102 (1A) of the Finance Act 1999 and the Deputy can be assured that, if Revenue's investigations and the analysis of fuel samples by the State Laboratory indicate the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.<\/p><p>  I am advised that it would not be feasible to undertake sampling and analysis of all petrol being delivered to filling stations.  Checking for contamination will, however, be carried out at various stages of the fuel supply chain, on the basis of an evaluation of the risk of the likelihood of adulteration.<\/p><p>  Information on the proportion of national retail sales of petrol accounted for by the filing stations from which samples have been taken is not readily available.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are a fully integrated tax and customs administration and it is not possible to disaggregate resources deployed exclusively at any given time on a particular element of their enforcement work.  There are approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance.  These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.  I am advised that the current issues relating to petrol quality are being dealt with as a high priority and that the deployment of staff to address those issues, from within the existing resources available to Revenue, reflects that priority.  I understand also that the Revenue Commissioners are working closely with the State Laboratory, which, in addition to analysing samples referred to it, is providing technical and scientific support for the on-going investigations.<\/p><p>  The first point of contact for motorists whose vehicles may have been affected should be their motor insurance companies.  Persons affected should also contact the point of purchase of the fuel.

The ECJ found that the pension funds at issue may be regarded as a special investment fund where the funds are invested using a risk spreading principle and the pension customers bear the investment risk.  The Court also held that the essential characteristic of a special investment fund is the pooling of assets of several beneficiaries, enabling the risk borne by those beneficiaries to be spread over a range of securities. <\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is their understanding that &quot;one member arrangements&quot; are generally administered by life insurance companies and through Small Self-Administered Schemes (SSAS's).  The trustees of &quot;non-insured&quot; contribution pension schemes have a much greater discretion as to how the scheme funds are invested, and there is no requirement that the investments are pooled.  In such circumstances, it is Revenue's view that the administration of such schemes do not meet the ECJ principles for VAT exemption.  In contrast, many smaller schemes in Ireland are &quot;insured&quot; schemes in which investments are made on a unitised\/non-segregated basis and concern a contract of insurance held by the pension holder.

According to DSP figures on the numbers and\u00a0ages of\u00a0children in receipt of child benefit in 2013, there were approximately 489,500 children under 6.<br\/><br\/>If tax relief at the standard rate of 20% were provided on the costs of childcare in respect of these children, it would result in a cost to the Exchequer of in the region of &euro;680 million per annum.  However, it must be borne in mind that these figures are extremely tentative and the real cost could be much higher.\u00a0<br\/><br\/>I\u00a0have no plans to introduce such\u00a0a tax relief as it could be seen to unfairly discriminate against those individuals who stay at home and look after their children.  While wanting to\u00a0encourage\u00a0participation in the workforce, equally we cannot say to individuals who stay at home to mind children that they are making a less\u00a0valuable contribution to society. <br\/><br\/>In addition, tax relief is only of benefit to those in the tax net and it is estimated that in 2014, 39% of income earners will be exempt from income tax.  It could also be argued that any tax relief\u00a0would most likely be absorbed by childcare providers in the form of higher prices.<br\/><br\/>Having said this, I would like to assure the\u00a0Deputy that the Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children. In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents.  These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free childcare places to qualifying\u00a0Solas and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school.  Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided. <br\/><br\/>The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and additionally to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment. <br\/><br\/>Furthermore, a Single Person Child Carer\u00a0tax credit of &euro;1,650 is available as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000.  This credit and band\u00a0is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated.  The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and<b><\/b>the increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year.<b><\/b>To claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit a claimant must not be married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting.<br\/><br\/>In relation to exempting childcare costs from tax when the service is provided by an employer, a\u00a0relief did exist in the form of\u00a0a benefit-in-kind exemption.  However, this relief was abolished in Finance Act 2011.  The Commission on Taxation recommended its abolition, citing equity issues in relation to those parents whose employers did not provide such facilities.<br\/><br\/>As the Deputy will\u00a0appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. \u00a0In considering these,\u00a0I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current budgetary constraints.\u00a0 Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100066#WRJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Funding","counter":366,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100066#WRJ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":367,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[43284\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100066#WRJ01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"with regard to correspondence (details supplied) the way in which the figure of &euro;550m is arrived at.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":368,"content":"<p>The figure of &euro;550m referred to by the Deputy represents the impact on the general government deficit for 2014 &amp;amp; 2015 if Irish Water is included within general government.

The Central Bank has informed me that where a concern arises that a prescribed contravention has been or is being committed, the Central Bank may investigate.\u00a0 Following an investigation an inquiry may be held where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a prescribed contravention has been or is being committed.\u00a0 The inquiry shall decide if the prescribed contravention has occurred and determine the appropriate sanctions.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>A prescribed contravention\u00a0could be a breach of:<br\/><br\/>- a provision in legislation<br\/><br\/>- a code, or a direction, given pursuant to legislation<br\/><br\/>- a condition or requirement imposed on a regulated financial service provider<br\/><br\/>- any obligation imposed on a regulated financial service provider by the Central Bank <br\/><br\/>Following an inquiry, the Central Bank, for example, can impose one or more of the sanctions below:<br\/><br\/>- caution or reprimand;<br\/><br\/>- direction to refund or withhold all or part of money charged or paid, or to be charged or paid, for the provision of financial service by a financial service provider;<br\/><br\/>- a direction to pay the Central Bank a monetary penalty (not exceeding the greater of &euro;10,000,000 or 10% of turnover where the financial service provider is a body corporate or an unincorporated body and not exceeding &euro;1,000,000 where the financial service provider is a natural person and for persons concerned in the management of a financial service provider);<br\/><br\/>- disqualification of a person from being concerned in the management of a regulated financial service provider;<br\/><br\/>- revocation or suspension of an authorisation;<br\/><br\/>- direction to the regulated financial service provider to cease committing the contravention;<br\/><br\/>- direction to pay the Central Bank all or part of its costs incurred by the Central Bank in the investigation of the matter and the holding an inquiry.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>The Central Bank has advised that to date, it has not imposed a sanction on a mortgage lender in relation to breaches of the CCMA.\u00a0 More information on the Administrative Sanctions procedure can be found at the following link: ).\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank monitors compliance with the statutory consumer protection requirements through its on-going engagement with firms, reviews and research, themed inspections, mystery shopping, and advertising monitoring.\u00a0 The Central Bank regularly conducts themed inspections to ensure compliance with all of its codes of conducts, including the CCMA.  Themed inspections examine issues across a sector.  Where a specific compliance issue arises with an individual firm, this is addressed directly with the firm and where appropriate, regulatory action may be taken.\u00a0 Breaches of regulatory requirements are dealt with in accordance with the Administrative Sanctions procedure.  To promote compliance, the Central Bank provides feedback on themed inspections and publish the main issues on its website.\u00a0 The Central Bank has conducted a number of themed inspections on the CCMA since its introduction in 2009.\u00a0 Details of these themes and the feedback issued can be found at the following link: .<br\/><br\/>The Central Bank's plan for themed inspections in 2014 ) includes an inspection of mortgage lenders to test compliance with the revised CCMA.\u00a0 Compliance with the CCMA is also a Central Bank enforcement priority for 2014.<br\/><br\/>Where a borrower believes that their lender has not complied with or in any way disregarded the CCMA, he\/she may make a complaint to their lender.  The lender must seek to resolve the borrower's complaint in line with the complaints handling process set out in provisions 10.7 to 10.12 of the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code.\u00a0\u00a0Each lender must also establish an Appeals Board to consider and determine any such appeals submitted by borrowers.\u00a0\u00a0If the borrower remains dissatisfied following the outcome from the complaints or appeals process, he\/she may then refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO) who deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all regulated financial service providers.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>I have been informed by the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO) that in relation to Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) complaints, where issues of sustainability\/repayment capacity are in dispute, the FSO is only in a position to investigate a complaint as to whether the provider, in handling a mortgage arrears issue, correctly adhered to its obligations pursuant to the CCMA.<br\/><br\/>Details of the number of findings where the issue of CCMA\/MARP was raised and the findings issued are detailed below:<table><tr><th>Reporting Period<\/th><th>Finding Issued<\/th><th>Upheld<\/th><th>Partly Upheld<\/th><th>Not Upheld<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>69<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>54<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<br \/><br \/>[to 30.10.14]<\/td><td>88<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>67<\/td><\/tr><\/table>These statistics relate to complaints made\/referred to the FSO only and do not include complaints in relation to non-compliance which may have been made directly to the Central Bank of Ireland and which may have been dealt with by the CBI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100066#WRJ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":391,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100066#WRJ02700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works Properties","counter":390,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100066#WRJ02650"},{"type":"question","counter":391,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[42953\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100066#WRJ02700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the Office of Public Works is in a position to provide the number of famine victims buried at Kilmainham, Dublin 8; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"947","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":392,"content":"<p>There are 63 recorded deaths in Kilmainham Gaol in the relevant Famine period.

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. \u00a0It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds such as nationality, organisational size, etc. and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. <br\/><br\/>The Government acknowledges the significant role that SMEs play in the Irish economy and is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.\u00a0 DPER Circular 10\/14 is aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses that want to tender for public contracts and also to ensure that engaging with government procurement is easy and low cost.\u00a0 The key initiatives are as follows: buyers are advised to undertake market analysis prior to tendering in order to better understand the range of goods and services on offer, the competitive landscape, including the specific capabilities of SMEs; the circular promotes transparency in procurement by requiring supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 to be advertised on the Government's electronic tendering portal, e-Tenders; the circular encourages suppliers including SMEs to fully use e-Tenders and avail of its facilities in relation to registration, e-tendering and automatic alerts in relation to future tendering opportunities; buyers are encouraged not to set turnover thresholds at more than twice the estimated contract value and puts limits on insurance levels for suppliers where possible; the circular promotes greater use of &quot;open&quot; tendering and less use of &quot;restrictive&quot; tendering; the circular\u00a0 encourages SMEs to consider using consortia where they are not of sufficient scale to tender in their own right or where they may lack certain capabilities necessary to provide a compelling proposition; the circular encourages Contracting Authorities to break large contracts down into lots where reasonable to do so and where it does\u00a0not expose the State to undue risk or significant management overheads.<br\/><br\/>The OGP also supports the work of Enterprise Ireland and InterTrade Ireland in building awareness of public procurement and supporting training for small suppliers in bidding for public contracts.\u00a0 Last year the OGP, for example, supported two &quot;Meet the Buyer&quot; events in Belfast and Dublin last year attended by approximately 1,000 suppliers. \u00a0Approximately 1,700 are expected to attend similar events this year. \u00a0In addition, the OGP supported the 'Go 2 Tender' programme run by InterTrade Ireland which was attended by 317 SME's last year.This year InterTrade Ireland are also \u00a0delivering a programme on Consortia Building to assist SME's in developing understanding to enable them to jointly bid for state contracts.<br\/><br\/>The OGP will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that Government procurement policies are business friendly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100067#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":413,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100067#WRK01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":412,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100067#WRK01350"},{"type":"question","counter":413,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[43080\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100067#WRK01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the trade arrangements that exist between Ireland and the United States; the tariffs that exist between Ireland and the US in respect of trade; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":414,"content":"<p>Trade arrangements between Ireland and the United States are governed by the EU&rsquo;s Common Commercial Policy under Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

But I also believe that the experience of ISDS internationally shows us there is room for much improvement in how the system works.

Its aim is to achieve the greatest possible improvement, from genetic and other factors, in the profitability of the national sheep flock for the benefit of Irish farmers and the sheep industry.  Sheep Ireland was formed as a sister company to ICBF, based on the recommendation from the Malone report which proposed a way forward for sheep breeding in Ireland along similar lines to that achieved by ICBF for cattle breeding.  This included an industry based decision making structure and a database to meet the information needs of the sheep breeding sector and the wider industry. <\/p><p>  Sheep Ireland commenced operations in 2009. Key developments in that year included the following:<\/p><p>- The creation of the Sheep Ireland database and the establishment of breeding objectives and selection criteria for sheep in Ireland;<\/p><p>- The establishment of LambPlus, which is the performance recording scheme for ram breeders, the formation of the maternal lamb producers programme, and a central progeny testing system.   <\/p><p>  My Department has been providing funding towards the establishment of the infrastructure necessary to establish a world class breeding programme since the inception of Sheep Ireland. A permanent representative Board structure for Sheep Ireland was put in place. Following extensive industry consultation in 2011 and 2012 an agreement was reached with stakeholders on a voluntary levy of seven cents per head on all sheep slaughtering as a co-funding mechanism. <\/p><p>  Sheep Ireland is leading the development of a National Sheep Breed improvement programme, working with pedigree breeders to improve the quality of rams being supplied to commercial farmers. Sheep Ireland has managed to increase the number of pedigree breeders participating in performance recording to almost 500, thereby identifying the most profitable breeding stock. Usage of these highly selected genetically superior males and females has had a major positive effect in commercial flocks across the country. <\/p><p>  Sheep Ireland also plays a central role in providing breeding values for rams for the Sheep Technology Adoption Programme, rams that eventually end up in commercial flocks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100068#WRL01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Applications","counter":455,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100068#WRL01150"},{"type":"question","counter":456,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[42876\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100068#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the deductions made from the disadvantaged areas payment 2014 or single farm payments in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Mayo; the reason those deductions were made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":457,"content":"<p>An application under 2014 Single Payment\/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 7 May 2014.

The company advise me that the property is valued internally to establish its forestry value and by a competent auctioneer and valuer to establish its commercial valuation in order to determine the Advised Minimum Value prior to offering the property for sale and that the method of sale appropriate to the property is also selected &ndash; tender, auction or negotiation - which is designed to ensure that Coillte can maximise the value received. The company further advise that all sales (except cases where there is no independent access and the only potential purchasers are adjoining landowners) are advertised.

The outcome of the discussions held by this group was the publication, earlier this year, of the Draft Bioenergy Plan. This plan is available on the DCENR website at the following address: <br\/><br\/>Biomass is defined in the Draft Bioenergy Plan as the &ldquo;biodegradeable fraction of products, waste and residues of biological origin from agriculture, forestry and related industries including fisheries and aquaculture, as well as the biodegradeable fraction of industrial and municipal waste. Biomass can be used in all three energy sectors: electricity, heat, and transport&rdquo;. The vast bulk of biomass in this country is, and will continue to be, provided by the forestry sector. <br\/><br\/>The Draft Bioenergy Plan identifies the opportunity for the sustainable development of Ireland's bioenergy resources and will be implemented through a number of policy and enabling actions. The Plan recommends the continuation of the REFIT3 scheme which is designed to incentivise the addition of 310 MW of renewable electricity capacity to the Irish electricity grid. The scheme was designed,<i>inter alia<\/i>, to complement the Bioenergy Scheme by offering a premium tariff for electricity generated from energy crops. The Plan also recommends, subject to State Aid clearance and further Government approval, the introduction of a renewable heat incentive for larger heat users to change to renewable heating solutions. The introduction of such a scheme would further increase the demand for biomass.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, a range of measures is recommended to underpin the supply of Irish biomass including continued support for the Bioenergy Scheme and the Afforestation Programme, both of which are administered by my Department. There is also scope for small-scale energy generation from, for example, pig manure and poultry litter. Research on this type of project has been funded by my Department in recent years. Grant aid has also been provided for the installation of biomass boilers to heat glasshouses and mushroom tunnels operated by horticultural producers. <br\/><br\/>Reflecting the cross-sectoral nature of bioenergy, implementation of the actions arising from the Plan will be coordinated by a Bioenergy Steering Group which will draw on the relevant government departments, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, agencies and stakeholders as appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100068#WRL02500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Applications","counter":476,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100068#WRL02550"},{"type":"question","counter":477,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[42939\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100068#WRL02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payment under the single farm payment and area aid payment 2014 will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":478,"content":"<p>The person named submitted an application under the 2014 Single Payment and Disadvantaged Area Schemes on 30 April 2014.

However I have on-going contact with Minister Noonan to ensure that tax policy reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture.  In this regard I am pleased that the Minister and I could facilitate the Agri-taxation Review, which was published as part Budget 2015.  It gave us a unique opportunity to examine a critical element of Government support to the agriculture sector in the context of the strategy of expansion and increasing exports under Food Harvest 2020.  The Review provides a strong evidence base for continued assistance to the primary sector through taxation measures and it is a clear strategy with specific policy objectives for the future.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture is evidenced by the immediate implementation of the majority of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations in Budget 2015, including 12 new measures, which form part of a strategic policy response to the opportunities and challenges ahead.   <\/p><p>  One of the taxation policy objectives identified by the Review is to assist succession.  The age profile of Irish farmers is increasing and it is recognised that there are many social and economic reasons why succession management is a challenge for farmers. Assisting succession and the transfer of farms has been a central part of the Government&rsquo;s agri-taxation policy and Budget 2015 included a number of measures to maintain and strengthen that support, specifically:<\/p><p>- The retention and targeting of Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) to active farmers or to those who lease out land long-term;<\/p><p>- The retention and enhancement of Retirement Relief from Capital Gains Tax, including two new measures:<\/p><p>- The extension of the eligible letting period of a qualifying asset to 25 years;<\/p><p>- For transfers other than to a child under Retirement Relief, as a once-off measure until the end of 2016, the inclusion of conacre lettings as eligible.  I believe that this measure to allow famers who have been engaged in conacre to avail of Retirement Relief if they transfer or move to long-term leasing before the end of 2016 is significant, and will give exit options to a large cohort of farmers.<\/p><p>- The retention of the current stamp duty exemptions on transfers of land, including the extension of Stamp Duty Consanguinity Relief, i.e. relief to related persons, on non-residential transfers to the end of 2017.   <\/p><p>  The new measures will be implemented by way of the Finance Bill, which was published recently.

The project is modelled on the well known Greenfield dairy demonstration farm in Kilkenny which annually attracts large numbers of farmers and discussion groups. The Greenfield model involved the establishment of a company to operate and finance the dairy farm. It is highly regarded, and provides a public good demonstration service to all farmers in the dairy sector. \u00a0It is envisaged that the Athenry project would operate along similar lines with the aim of demonstrating to farmers, the profit that can be obtained from a well run suckler beef farm.\u00a0   <\/p><p>  The Athenry project is an operational matter for Teagasc and its governing Authority, which is representative of the main stakeholder groups in the agri-food sector, including representatives of the farming organisations.   <\/p><p>  I understand that Teagasc is in discussions with the company in question which is the only meat company to have expressed willingness to assist in the project. It is anticipated that the company would be responsible for managing and financing the demonstration farm similar to the Greenfield project. As a member of the project steering group, Teagasc&rsquo;s role is to provide expert technical advice and to disseminate the research results to farmers.\u00a0Teagasc is also making available rented lands in Athenry for the project. My Department has only recently been approached by Teagasc to see if some Department owned land in Athenry could be made available and this matter is currently under examination. <\/p><p>  Teagasc is satisfied that the Athenry suckler demonstration farm will provide very valuable information to all beef farmers and will be a major focal point for discussion groups.   <\/p><p>  In establishing the beef roundtable discussions, it was identified that more could be done to improve transparency throughout the beef sector. My Department collates the prices paid for domestic cattle on a weekly basis and reports this data to the European Commission in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1249\/2008 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 148\/2014. To ensure price transparency, results for Members States are published on the DG Agriculture &amp;amp; Rural Development website. The published weekly data includes market prices for carcases and live animals as well as information on production and herd inventories. This publicly accessible information allows stakeholders to monitor the evolution of the market situation in each Member State. <\/p><p>  There is also a wealth of information available to farmers under the Beef PriceWatch section on my Department&rsquo;s website, including the prices for Steers, Cows, and Heifers across the classification grid, for each DAFM approved factory. <\/p><p>  My Department recently launched the Beef PriceWatch app which brings together the above information in an easy to use format direct to farmers Smartphone&rsquo;s, tablets and Pc&rsquo;s. The app includes grid prices on a per factory basis for young bulls adding another degree of transparency to the sector.   <\/p><p>  With regards to slaughter figures, my Department publishes the Meat Market Report weekly within the Beef Pricewatch area of our website which gives details of number of animals slaughtered broken down by category of animal. <\/p><p>  Finally on the question of livestock breeding and production research I have provided &euro;33m in 2014 for a beef data and genomics scheme to improve breed quality in the suckler herd, in addition to the substantial funding provided to Teagasc, ICBF and AHI.

Garda actions under the Plan include dedicated high visibility patrols in key commercial and public thoroughfares including Temple Bar. These patrols are informed by crime trends, demand studies and footfall in the areas in question. I am also aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages extensively with business and community interests in the city centre area with respect to crime prevention, enforcement and policing concerns.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the deployment of Garda resources. From my discussions with the Garda authorities I am assured that Garda management in the Dublin Metropolitan Region keep this deployment under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, including with respect to concerns about public order and anti-social behaviour, so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of policing resources.<\/p><p>  The Garda approach includes focusing resources on specific areas of the city according to need. As part of this, a number of targeted city centre policing operations are in place.<\/p><p>  These operations include Operation Pier, which concentrates on the South Quays and Temple Bar area. This operation includes the designation of certain areas as &quot;hotspots&quot; for anti-social behaviour and regular uniformed and plain clothes patrols. Other Garda Operations in the city centre include Operation Spire which is focussed on the O&rsquo;Connell Street and North Inner City areas, and Operation Stilts which is an ongoing overt policing operation targeting anti-social behaviour and drug-related crime in Dublin city centre locations.<\/p><p>  I am conscious of the perspectives of business and community interests about the effects of certain types of crime and anti-social behaviour on the environment for business and leisure and on the overall quality of life for residents. Some of the problems faced are linked to disorder associated with abuse of alcohol and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely with a wide range of businesses involved in the entertainment and nighttime economy to address these issues so that people can enjoy themselves without concern for their welfare.<\/p><p>  Other challenges have their origin in even more complex social phenomena which go well beyond the capacity of criminal justice agencies to address on their own. Dealing with these matters requires a coordinated approach from state agencies involved in social, housing, health and drug treatment services, as well as through partnership with business, community and voluntary groups. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is already a long term partner in a range of local consultative and representative structures in Dublin and elsewhere.

Any person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to imprisonment for life or a lesser term, and at the discretion of the court, to a fine.It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years and-or a fine.<br\/><br\/>There are also provisions in our criminal law directed at the public nuisances and exploitation associated with prostitution.

It is a condition of the contract that a valid Tax Clearance Certificate from the Revenue Commissioners is provided every year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100071#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision Expenditure","counter":587,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100071#WRO01100"},{"type":"question","counter":588,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[42845\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100071#WRO01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the amount of money spent on the direct provision system over the past eight years; and the companies to whom those payments were made.","asker":"1192","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":589,"qnumday":303,"qnumall":"[42995\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100071#WRO01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide, in tabular form, a list of contracts awarded to, and amounts paid to, the owners and operators of direct provision centres from the establishment of the direct provision system to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":590,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 291 and 303 together.<br\/><br\/>The direct provision system is managed by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department.

Currently, approximately, 4,300 persons are residing in 34 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA. <br\/><br\/>I and previous Ministers have explained before in detail to this House how direct provision came about in  response to a major accommodation crisis that existed at the time of its establishment.  At its high point in 2005, the number of persons residing in direct provision was 8080.  <br\/><br\/>The existence of the direct provision system over the last 14 years has ensured that the State has been able to ensure that those who claim international protection in this country - and do not have the means to support themselves - have been provided with accommodation and a range of ancillary services including health care and education.  During this period, no asylum seeker has ever been left homeless, and over 52,000 people have been provided with accommodation under the direct provision system since its establishment in 2000.<br\/><br\/>Nonetheless, the Government is committed to making real improvements to the protection process, including direct provision.  We made a number of commitments to this end in the Statement of Government Priorities 2014 &ndash; 2016.

The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency is a statutory service supporting regular school attendance for all school age children and young people. Formerly, this service was carried out by the National Educational Welfare Board. <\/p><p>  The Agency has advised me that the information the Deputy has sought is not readily available. <\/p><p>  Where school attendance problems arise for a child, the Agency concentrates on finding solutions within a collaborative intervention framework involving children and their families, schools and other relevant agencies.  This involves an ongoing, evolving and dynamic process of engagement by Educational Welfare Officers of the Child and Family Agency with schools, parents and other support agencies where a child is out of school.  The Agency has advised that this work results in a significant level of positive outcomes for children, which is not readily amenable to data-analysis.  Given the impact of absence from school on a child's learning, this process is always prioritised within the range of Educational Welfare Officers&rsquo; responsibilities.  It is a task that is student-focused and solution-driven, sometimes prolonged and sometimes involving short-term or temporary outcomes.  The primary outcome sought in all cases is a placement in a recognised school or centre for education.<\/p><p>  According to the Agency, there are a number of reasons why a student may not have a school place at a particular time.  These may include capacity issues in individual schools or in areas of increasing population and correspondingly high demand for school places.  Issues of school capacity generally are a matter for the Department of Education and Skills.  Parents have a right of appeal under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 where a school place has been refused and Educational Welfare Officers are frequently and successfully involved in seeking and achieving alternative placements where schools' decisions to refuse enrolment have been upheld.<\/p><p>  In cases of expulsion of a student from a school, and where all efforts to resolve matters at school level or through the Section 29 process have failed, there is a statutory obligation on an Educational Welfare Officer to make all reasonable efforts to ensure that provision is made for the continued education of the student concerned.  The first solution sought will always be a placement in another recognised school. Temporary solutions may include home-tuition sanctioned by the Department of Education and Skills, in exceptional circumstances.  In some cases, where all other solutions have failed, the student may engage in an alternative education programme provided by non-statutory or voluntary agencies or organisations. <\/p><p>  The Agency advises that in the case of students who have difficulty in securing a school place and who have a diagnosed special educational need, Educational Welfare Officers work in close collaboration with the Special Education Needs Organisers of the National Council for Special Education, with the National Educational Psychological Service, with the Special Education Section of the Department of Education and Skills and with Special Schools and other specialist support agencies and providers, to identify and put in place effective solutions to the placement needs of such students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100073#WRQ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children in Care","counter":675,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100073#WRQ00625"},{"type":"question","counter":676,"qnumday":322,"qnumall":"[42847\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100073#WRQ00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his views in relation to the number of children who have disappeared from State care over the past five years; the numbers who were subsequently found, and the age profile of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":677,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, there is a joint protocol in place between the Child and Family Agency, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, referred to as <i>Children Missing From Care - A Joint Protocol between An Garda Sioch&aacute;na and the Health Service Executive Children and Family Service<\/i>, which includes a definition of a child being considered as missing for the purposes of reporting to the Garda&iacute;.

The majority of children in care, some 93%, are in foster care, and one third of those are placed with relatives.  The budget for Foster Care and Other Allowances is reported by the Agency as &euro;115.2 million for the full year.<\/p><p>  The Child and Family Agency receives a child into care where it appears that a child requires care and protection that he\/she is unlikely to receive unless he\/she is taken into care.  If a foster placement is assessed as being appropriate, then every effort is made to match the needs of the child to a suitable placement with a foster family.  In these cases, the child has an allocated social worker who is there to plan and follow up with the necessary reviews.  <\/p><p>  The Agency is seeking to recruit more foster carers, most recently in particular, foster carers from different ethnic backgrounds and carers interested in caring for teenagers, children with challenging behaviour or children with disabilities. Where a person is interested in becoming a foster carer they must apply to the Agency, through their local office, which will provide advice initially.  If the application is pursued further, the Agency will undertake a rigorous assessment of the person's suitability, a process which includes Garda vetting.  If the applicants are to be placed on a Foster Care Panel, support and training is provided by the Agency.  The carers are provided with a link worker for supervising training and other ongoing supports.  I would also note that the Agency provides funding to the Irish Foster Care Association which provides additional supports to carers.  When a child is placed with a foster family there is a payment made that is intended to support the child's expenses, including activities appropriate to that age group.  <\/p><p>  The numbers of children who are taken into care can vary from area to area and this is apparent from the statistics that are made available on the Agency's website.  This variation across the country is not unexpected and is co-related with the under 18 years old population and the reported deprivation score by Haase Pratschke (Pobal, 2012).  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100073#WRQ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection","counter":681,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100073#WRQ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":682,"qnumday":324,"qnumall":"[42885\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100073#WRQ01100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his plans to introduce Garda vetting for child minders.","asker":"984","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":683,"qnumday":325,"qnumall":"[42886\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100073#WRQ01150","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his plans to introduce a central statutory register of child minders.

Those exempted include childminders taking care of not more than three pre-school children from different families in the childcare provider's own home.  Childminders in this category are not, therefore, required to notify their services and are not subject to the further requirements of the 2006 Child Care Regulations, which include the requirement to ensure appropriate vetting of all staff, students and volunteers in the service who have access to children<\/p><p>  Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991 was amended under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, and revised Child Care Regulations as required under those amendments are currently being developed.  Part VII as revised retain the exemptions in the original Part VII, including those exemptions applicable to childminders.  <\/p><p>  The exemption provided to childminders with fewer than three children recognises parental choice to place children with friends and neighbours, and the challenges of the over-regulation of the more informal arrangements chosen by parents.  Such childminders are encouraged to voluntarily register their service with their local City or County Childcare Committee.  Both registered and voluntarily registered childminders can avail of the Childminders Tax Exemption which exempts childminding earnings of up to &euro;15,000 from income tax.  My Department will continue to promote the voluntary registration of childminding services and the participation of childminders in quality and training programmes.  However, the Department is not in a position to prevent parents from entering into informal arrangements with childminders who are outside the scope of the Regulations. <\/p><p>  Some &euro;10 million of funding, allied to the childminders supports, was invested over a period of 10 years to encourage childminders to notify their service.  This was seen as a potential first step to ensuring that non-family childminders were subject to all of the requirements of the Regulations.  This stepped approach has worked in some countries, such as Scotland.  However, only 1,250 childminders voluntarily notified in this country and a further 2,000 to 3,000 participate in training.  It is clear that there are barriers specific to Ireland in bringing childminders under the regulatory framework.  <\/p><p>   The Early Years Strategy will include consideration of how this complex issue might be addressed in the future.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100073#WRQ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Years Strategy Publication","counter":685,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100073#WRQ01450"},{"type":"question","counter":686,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[42887\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100073#WRQ01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the date on which the early years strategy will be published.

These programmes developed on an adhoc basis and were introduced at different times but in general very quickly.  My Department has therefore been running these programmes without a strong ICT infrastructure.  This means that systems are not efficient and in particular that payments can be slow to respond to changing circumstances.  It also means that there is limited access to information from the programmes.  It has always been the Department's intention to move to an integrated approach to support the programmes, and after considerable analysis work, my Department and Pobal are in the process of implementing a new management platform for the early years programmes &ndash; called the Programmes Implementation Platform (PIP).  PIP is an online system which will streamline the administrative processes across childcare funding programmes.  <br\/><br\/>The objectives of PIP are to reduce paperwork and duplication of effort and to simplify administration to enhance the service experience of childcare service providers and the other stakeholders involved; City\/County Childcare Committees, Pobal and DCYA.  This new development will provide a more comprehensive, integrated set of management processes, more efficient work practices, greater visibility and control of funds and commitments and will substantially improve the capacity of the Department, City and County Childcare Committees and services on the ground to dynamically manage service by service and case by case approvals and changes in each of the programmes.<br\/><br\/>PIP is being rolled out incrementally. The launch of the first stage of PIP, &lsquo;Child Registrations&rsquo;, began on the 6 October 2014.  To date, childcare service providers have registered over 60,000 children for the ECCE Programme and the local City\/County Childcare Committees have registered over 3,500 children for the various TEC Programmes.<br\/><br\/>The introduction of new ICT infrastructure tends to result in issues emerging and PIP has been no exception.  Technical issues, such as those specifically detailed by the Deputy, did result in service providers experiencing delays in registering children on the system.  On 15 October, while over 30,000 children had already been registered on the system for the ECCE Programme, my Department took the decision to issue a further advance payment to service providers to allow for those service providers who had experienced delays or difficulties to complete their registrations.  While acknowledging the inconvenience for service providers not receiving accurate balancing payments as early as possible, the decision was taken to ensure that all service providers were to receive sufficient advance funding to honour any financial commitments, rather than to delay all payments until the technical glitches on PIP were resolved.  <br\/><br\/>Three of the issues raised by the Deputy to the PPSN checker, which is the responsibility of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The introduction of immediate checking of the validity of PPS Numbers is a key element of the improvements introduced by PIP, as it will mean instantaneeous validity checks.  This replaces the previous unwieldy and long process that involved my Department sending batches of PPS numbers to the Department of Social Protection for checking.  This was a major cause of delays in validating eligibility and therefore payments.  On the PIP Child Registration Form, during the first few weeks of the launch a number issues arose with the PPSN Checker.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform speedily addressed issues as they emerged and service providers continued to get updates on the PIP Homepage, which is hosted on the Pobal website (), on how to manage these issues while registering.<br\/><br\/>I can assure the Deputy that both my Department and Pobal are working together to address issues as PIP develops, and I am confident that once the system is fully operational the Childcare &lsquo;Programmes Implementation Platform&rsquo; will prove to be extremely beneficial and efficient for all users for years to come and in particular will significantly improve the situation for service providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100073#WRQ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Obesity Strategy","counter":694,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100073#WRQ02050"},{"type":"question","counter":695,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[43252\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100073#WRQ02100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the policy decisions he has taken and is taking to stop the growing obesity problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":696,"content":"<p>The Department of Health has primary responsibility for policy in relation to obesity and is supported by my Department in the effort to address the issue of childhood obesity.<br\/><br\/>My Department launched &lsquo;Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014 -2020&rsquo; in 2014.  &lsquo;Better Outcomes: Brighter Futures&rsquo; is the first overarching national policy framework for children and young people aged from birth to 24 years and will be implemented by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in collaboration with all Government departments and key State agencies.

The Framework includes a range of government commitments, with responsibility across a number of Departments, to tackle this issue of childhood obesity. <br\/><br\/>My Department is represented on the Special Action Group on Obesity which has progressed a range of measures to tackle this issue.<br\/><br\/>The Area Based Childhood (ABC) programme 2013-2016 is a &euro;29.7m programme which is being co-funded by my Department and the Atlantic Philanthropies, to improve outcomes for children in some of our most disadvantaged areas.  Some of the initiatives are encompassing empowering healthy choices for children and families, in relation to diet and exercise, as part of a holistic approach to improving children&rsquo;s lives.<br\/><br\/>It is widely accepted by researchers that there is a strong link between physical activity and overweight, and habits formed in youth tend to carry over into adulthood. The Growing Up in Ireland Study also clearly confirms this finding.  Young people who took more exercise were less likely to be <i>overweight <\/i>or <i>obese<\/i>, especially in comparison to those who never exercised.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I have responsibility for Play and Recreation Policy which has been set out in &lsquo;READY, STEADY, PLAY! A National Play Policy&rsquo; and the &lsquo;National Recreation Policy for Young People&rsquo;, both of which seek to actively promote the participation of children and young people in play and exercise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100073#WRQ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":698,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100073#WRQ02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Funding","counter":697,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100073#WRQ02225"},{"type":"question","counter":698,"qnumday":330,"qnumall":"[43164\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100073#WRQ02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding funding.","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":699,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

The 12 professions currently designated under the Act are clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists. <\/p><p>  Psychotherapists and counsellors are not currently regulated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.

The Act provides that the Minister for Health is obliged to consult with the Council in the first instance concerning a proposed designation and to give interested persons, organisations and bodies an opportunity to make representations to the Minister.  The Council has been asked to advise on a number of issues concerning the proposed designation and requested that it take into consideration the recently published report of Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) on the academic standards necessary for the accreditation of courses in Counselling and Psychotherapy.  This is an essential element as it will inform, for the purpose of registration, the assessment by the registration board, when established, of the qualifications of those currently in practice.  <\/p><p>  This is the first stage in the consultation process under the Act and I expect to receive the Council's report in the coming weeks. I will proceed to the next stage which will involve a much wider consultation when I have fully considered the Council's report.  While a number of issues remain to be clarified including decisions on whether one or two professions are to be regulated, on the title or titles of the profession or professions, and on the minimum qualifications to be required of applicants for registration, I intend to progress the regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists as a priority.  I hope to be in a position to make the necessary designation regulations next year.

","asker":"998","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":823,"content":"<p>In line with the Programme for Government, my priority as Minister has been to modernise our mental health services, notwithstanding the severe resource constraints overall in recent years, and to prioritise new resources to underpin implementation of <i>A Vision for Change.<\/i>In that regard, the Government made available in the region of &euro;766m to the HSE for mental health services in the current year.  Taking account of the &euro;35m  announced in the recent Budget, and including specific funding allocations since 2012, a total of &euro;125m additional ring-fenced funding has been been provided by the Government for mental health since coming coming into office.  This funding has been allocated towards upwards of 1,100 new staff for the ongoing re-configuration of community mental health teams, in particular, and to underpin the development of a recovery-focussed and community-centred service. Bearing in mind the many competing demands on both the wider Health budget and Exchequer funding generally, this represents a substantial ongoing commitment to our mental health services. <br\/><br\/>Historically, funding for the mental health services constituted a high proportion of overall health spend in Ireland. In part, this reflected the traditional emphasis on an institutional model of service delivery with a clinical care focus. While funding may have been a higher than the recent percentage of 6.1% quoted by the Deputy, much of this funding would have been spent on what was considered a staff-intensive and relatively expensive model of service. In addition, historically other areas of the overall health budget in Ireland may not have received an adequate level of funding appropriate to a modern community-focussed health service.  This has been rectified in recent times in, for example, the primary and community care areas, whose development is also important for users of social care services such as people with mental health issues. <br\/><br\/>In line with A Vision for Change, the HSE mental health service is now moving towards a more person-centred recovery model of care, with an increasing focus on community delivery. This model of service is widely agreed to be more focussed on the needs of the service user in the first instance. It is also considered to be more cost effective and aims for a planned greater integration of services across the primary and community care sectors over time.  Therefore, while every effort will be made to maximise resources for mental health, the promotion and resourcing of positive mental health extends on a much broader range of HSE service areas.  In this context, a certain degree of caution is recommended when comparing mental health spent with that in other countries as the structure and funding of wider health and personal social care systems can vary significantly from country to country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100076#WRT02300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabilities Services Funding","counter":824,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100076#WRT02350"},{"type":"question","counter":825,"qnumday":375,"qnumall":"[42991\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100076#WRT02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding funding for the visually impaired; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":826,"content":"<p>I am informed that a number of service providers have raised concerns with the Health Service Executive (HSE) on the additional costs arising in meeting the HIQA regulations.

In addition, through the Pharmacy Needle Exchange Programme,  accessible harm reduction services have been expanded outside Dublin and 130 community pharmacies have been recruited and trained to provide needle exchange services. <\/p><p>  A National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee (NDRIC),  chaired by the HSE and including representation from relevant Government departments and agencies and the community and voluntary sectors,  is overseeing the roll out of a national integrated model of care.   This model is based on an interagency approach to the delivery of rehabilitation and shared care planning to ensure that service users access the range of supports required to assist them in their recovery.  This model has been piloted in 10 sites across the country and following evaluation is being rolled out nationally. <\/p><p>  The Report of the HSE Working Group on Residential Treatment &amp;amp; Rehabilitation (Substance Misuse) published in 2007, provided a detailed analysis and overview of known residential treatment services at the time and advised on the future residential requirements of those affected by drug and alcohol use.  The report indicated that current provision was 672.5 beds comprising 38 residential detoxification beds and 634.5 residential rehabilitation beds.  The most recent figures available from the HSE indicate that there are now 804 residential beds, comprising 23 inpatient unit detoxification beds, 117 community-based residential detoxification beds, 4 adolescent residential detoxification beds, 642 residential rehabilitation beds and 18 adolescent residential rehabilitation beds.  This represents a substantial increase of almost 20% on the 2007 figure. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100078#WRV02000","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Equipment","counter":899,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100078#WRV02100"},{"type":"question","counter":900,"qnumday":401,"qnumall":"[43147\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100078#WRV02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the radiology IT system in Letterkenny General Hospital, County Donegal, that was replaced at considerable cost and effort after the recent fold is now to be replaced with a similar national solution (details supplied); the reason a new system is being replaced so soon and at what cost to the taxpayer; the number of other hospitals having similar working systems replaced rather than integrated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1108","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":901,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly.

There is a link between consumption and harm and evidence that affordability is one of the drivers of increased consumption.  The Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse, to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  These measures are based on the recommendations contained in the <i>Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy<\/i>, 2012.The package of measures to be implemented will include provision for minimum unit pricing, regulation of the marketing and advertising of alcohol, regulation of sports sponsorship, structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets and labelling of alcohol products.  <br\/><br\/>The Government has decided that minimum unit pricing is the most effective policy measure to deal with the sale of alcohol at cheap prices.  Minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels per gram of alcohol that must be legally observed by retailers in both the on and off trade sector.  This is a targeted measure, designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  It is mainly aimed at those who are higher risk, such as adolescents and people who have a harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption pattern.  It should therefore only have a marginal effect on moderate drinkers.  It is not expected that minimum unit pricing will affect the price of alcohol in the on-trade sector or the majority of alcohol products sold in the off-trade sector.  Work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing and it is hoped to publish a General Scheme of a Bill shortly.  <br\/><br\/>My colleague, Frances Fitzgerald, Minister for Justice and Equality has responsibility for the Licensing Acts 1833 - 2011.  A 3-step approach to provide for the structured separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets has been agreed between our Departments.  This involves replacing the current Responsible Retailers of Alcohol in Ireland voluntary code of practice on the sale and display of alcohol in mixed trading premises with a statutory code under Section 17 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 and after 2 years both the Department of Health and the Department of Justice and Equality will review its effectiveness in achieving the policy objectives of Section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.  I understand that Minister Fitzgerald hopes to be in a position to launch a consultation process of the draft statutory code of practice shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100078#WRV04200","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Drugs Strategy Implementation","counter":922,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100079#WRW00200"},{"type":"question","counter":923,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[43176\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100079#WRW00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s consideration in the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 of adoption of a standard definition and national protocol concerning waiting times for opiate treatment with a view to ensuring a comprehensive data system is in place to monitor the progress of opiate treatment service provision.","asker":"1190","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":924,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[43177\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100079#WRW00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the plans by the Health Service Executive, as outlined in the National Drugs Strategy 2009 - 2016, to review the issue of data collection and analysis with a view to developing a more comprehensive data system for management and research purposes to address the particular difficulty with a lack of available data on the length of time people are remaining on methadone.

Consequently, the risk of transmission of Ebola in Ireland is considered very low.

The HPSC has published guidance for Airport Managers and Airlines, Port Managers and for educational settings.  It is also liaising with the Revenue Commissioners concerning guidance for customs officers.  The HPSC have produced specific information for travellers and people who have returned recently form affected areas.  Advices have also been produced for people intending to work with aid agencies in the affected countries.  Information posters have also been produced, and are on display in airports.

I believe that was achieved in Budget 2015, with an increase in the exchequer allocation of &euro;305 million. When taken together with once-off increased projected revenues of some &euro;330 million and savings and efficiencies of &euro;130 million ,the HSE will have over &euro;750 million more to fund services in 2015 that it did when preparing its Service Plan in 2014.<br\/><br\/>This does not mean that all areas of concern across the health service can be addressed immediately but it does make the funding situation more manageable.<br\/><br\/>Despite this additional spending power, next year remains a real challenge: our rising and aging population, the increase in chronic conditions with our progress in screening for cancers and chronic diseases means more people requiring treatment driving up demand and costs.<br\/><br\/>I aim to ensure that the existing level of services is maintained in 2015 and that some targeted enhancements are introduced.<br\/><br\/>I have already signalled that Programme for Government commitments on the extension of BreastCheck and investment in mental health will be honoured. Extra funding of &euro;25million will be provided to tackle the issue of delayed discharges, which is having a detrimental knock on effect on waiting times and emergency department overcrowding. In 2015, we will deliver on the first phase of Universal Health Care and some 240,000 children under 6 years and approximately 10,000 seniors over 70 years, who currently neither have a medical card non a GP visit card will be provided with a GP service without fees. <br\/><br\/>I want to continue the work of my predecessor Minister Reilly in further developing and building the Hospital Groups by putting in place Boards, CEOs and senior management teams and strategic plans.<br\/><br\/>I also want to take an active role in promoting healthy living.

All people ordinarily resident in the State are eligible for publicly-funded hospital services. In addition, about two-fifths of the population are eligible for publicly-funded primary care services. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Director-General of the HSE established an Expert Panel to examine and recommend the range of medical conditions that would be considered as a basis of eligibility for health services.  The Expert Panel was chaired by Prof Frank Keane, Past President of the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland and Clinical Lead, National Clinical Programme for Surgery. The panel included a range of 23 clinical experts from primary care, specialist services and therapies. It also included a patient representative. The work of the Expert Panel was also informed by on-line public consultation and the convening of a patient representative forum to consider the issues.<\/p><p>  The Keane report was received by my Department last month and I am considering its findings.

The current pharmacy based model results in over 70 million items being dispensed annually through local pharmacies across the State, including low population centres in rural areas. It enables pharmacies to receive deliveries each day from multiple wholesalers ensuring that all patients have continued access to essential medicines without delay. Under this model, as the drugs are purchased by individual pharmacies with no direct input by the HSE, there is no scope for the type of  central procurement arrangement envisaged by the Deputy. <\/p><p>  Establishing an alternative centralised distribution centre capable of distributing 70 million items across the State would be extremely difficult to achieve and would absorb any potential savings available to the HSE from directly purchasing medicines. <\/p><p>  Under the Memorandum of Understanding with the Troika, Ireland committed to increasing the share of generic drug usage in the medium-term. In Quarter 2 2014 generic products accounted for 64% of the total off-patent market by volume.  My Department has set a target of achieving 70% generic penetration of the off-patent market by volume by 2016.<\/p><p>  A number of enabling measures are being implemented to achieve this target, in particular, the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  <\/p><p>  In October 2012 a  new agreement on the pricing and supply of generic drugs was reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry.  Under this Agreement the maximum price the HSE pays for generic products was 50% of the initial price of an originator medicine, this was further reduced to 40% from 1 May 2014.  This has resulted in the price differential between off-patent drugs and most generic equivalents increasing from 5% to approximately 20%.<\/p><p>  The Medicines Management Programme within the HSE has introduced the preferred drugs initiative which facilitates more cost-effective prescribing particularly in relation to high-cost medicines.  It continues to engage with general practitioners to reinforce the message around safe, effective and cost-effective prescribing including generic prescribing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100080#WRX01900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Service Provision","counter":990,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100080#WRX01950"},{"type":"question","counter":991,"qnumday":434,"qnumall":"[43263\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100080#WRX02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which orthodontic services continue to be made available to children and teenagers with particular reference to follow-up on school medical examinations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":992,"content":"<p>The HSE provides orthodontic treatment to those who have been assessed and referred for treatment before their 16th birthday.

Our concern at the conviction and sentence was first conveyed by the Irish Ambassador accredited to Pakistan (from Ankara, Turkey) to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Islamabad in 2013. The Ambassador also expressed our disquiet at the nature of Pakistan&rsquo;s blasphemy law. Last week, on 6 November, our Ambassador to Pakistan visited Islamabad. In the course of his meetings there, he raised this case with a senior Foreign Ministry representative, noting that her case is a matter of grave public concern in Ireland.Officials in my Department also keep in regular contact with the Embassy of Pakistan on this and other issues. We recently raised the case, and our concerns regarding the blasphemy laws and persecution of Christians generally, with the Embassy of Pakistan.<br\/><br\/>Pakistan underwent a &lsquo;Universal Periodic Review&rsquo; of the human rights situation in the country at the United Nations Human Rights Council in October 2012.  At this review, concern was expressed about this case and calls were made for Pakistan to consider adopting an official moratorium on the death penalty.  During the process, Ireland recommended that Pakistan take all appropriate measures to combat and prevent discrimination against religious and other minority groups, including by removing educational material which could serve to perpetuate discrimination.<br\/><br\/>At EU level, freedom of religion or belief and freedom of opinion and expression play a central role in the EU&rsquo;s dialogue with Pakistan.  The High Representative for Foreign Affairs of the European Union, Catherine Ashton has expressed her concerns at the judgment, and others like it, on numerous occasions, and has called on Pakistan to respect human rights as guaranteed under international conventions.<br\/><br\/>In June 2014, the EU issued a Declaration on violence against women in Pakistan, expressing deep concern at the wide-spread violence perpetrated against women there.<br\/><br\/>The fifth meeting of the EU-Pakistan Joint Commission, which reviews EU-Pakistan bilateral relations annually, met in Islamabad on 24 June 2014. On human rights, the EU, while acknowledging efforts of the Government of Pakistan to strengthen human rights infrastructure in the country, expressed its concern on a number of issues including freedom of the media, freedom of religion and belief and the situation of women.<br\/><br\/>On 18 October last, a spokesperson for the European External Action Service expressed sadness and deep concern at the High Court decision to uphold this person&rsquo;s conviction, and called on Pakistan to ensure for all its citizens, full respect of human rights as guaranteed by international conventions to which it is party. The spokesperson further noted that the EU considers the death penalty a cruel and inhumane punishment and expressed the hope that the verdict would be appealed to the Supreme Court and struck down swiftly.<br\/><br\/>The issue of the death penalty in Pakistan and this case were also the subject of a statement made on behalf of the EU High Representative\/Vice-President Catherine Ashton at a plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 22 October last. In the course of that Statement, it was noted that the EU, and particularly its Delegation in Islamabad, would continue to follow the case closely and would continue to advocate for the verdict to be overturned and for the person concerned to be released. While not trying to intervene in an ongoing court case, the Statement noted that the EU would use any opportunity to raise this case and the wider issues of the death penalty and blasphemy law, with Pakistan.<br\/><br\/>The EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Mr Stavros Lambrinidis also visited Pakistan at the end of last month,  where he held an in depth dialogue with the Pakistan authorities on key human rights issues.<br\/><br\/>Ireland attaches great importance to the fundamental human rights of freedom of thought, conscience, religion or<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>belief.

In common with other Departments, the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade has sustained substantial staff reductions under the moratorium on recruitment.  Permanent Departmental staff numbers have fallen approximately 200, or about 13%, since 2009.  In order to try to ameliorate the impact of the ongoing reductions in staffing, a major re-structuring of the Department&rsquo;s Headquarters operations was completed in early 2012.  Other functions and staff are routinely reorganised or reallocated to maximize continuity of work output and minimise disruption to service delivery to the citizen.  For succession planning reasons, and on foot of comprehensive workforce planning exercises undertaken by my Department, exceptional sanction was received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform over the last two years to promote a number of officers to the grades of Counsellor and First Secretary to fill gaps created mainly by retirements. Sanction was also received to recruit a number of Third Secretaries, the entry grade to the diplomatic service, to fill existing and emerging vacancies in the grade at home and abroad.  The first appointments from this competition were made in April 2014 and a total of 27 new Third Secretaries are now in situ, with a further 2 to join the Department over the coming weeks.  These promotions and recruitment have constituted the main steps to counteract the loss of talent and experience from the diplomatic grades which has taken place over the last number of years.   I acknowledge that retirements at senior level represent a significant loss of experience and talent for the Department. In this regard, it is important that we recognise the contribution this outgoing generation of officials has made to the advancement of our country at home and abroad, including through active involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process, promoting our trading and cultural links, ably representing Ireland at the EU and UN and other international fora, and building our globally-acclaimed development cooperation programme.<\/p><p>  However, the recent recruitment and promotion of very high-calibre officers is helping to offset this tangible loss of experience, and is bringing an infusion of talent into the various grades and functions across my Department.  In addition, focussed training opportunities are being provided to staff at all levels so as to ensure that the service provided by our officials remains at a very high level.<\/p><p>  My Department will continue to assess its staffing requirements in the period ahead as part of its ongoing workforce planning process, in tandem with the setting of strategic priorities through the forthcoming Foreign Policy Review and Statement of Strategy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100081#WRY02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":1037,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100081#WRY02200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education and Training Boards","counter":1036,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100081#WRY02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1037,"qnumday":449,"qnumall":"[42859\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100081#WRY02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding a F&Aacute;S course in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1038,"content":"<p>This is a day to day operational matter for the Kerry Education and Training Board.

As a result:<br\/><br\/>- Inspectors interact with students during inspections, and in whole-school evaluations at post-primary level they meet with a focus group of students<br\/><br\/>- To strengthen the voice of students in evaluations, the Inspectorate introduced confidential learner questionnaires as part of whole-school evaluations in primary and post-primary schools in 2010. These questionnaires collect information on the views of students about the work of the school and their experiences at the school.<br\/><br\/>- Between September 2010 and December 2012, over  35,900 learner questionnaires were administered by the Inspectorate in primary schools and over 26,500 learner questionnaires were administered in post-primary schools. <br\/><br\/>- The learner questionnaires are confidential. They are processed in the Evaluation Support and Research Unit (ESRU) of the Inspectorate and a copy of the analysed statistical data from the questionnaires is made available to the inspectors conducting the evaluation and to the school. The data is used as an important source of evidence by the inspection team. <br\/><br\/>Other examples include:<br\/><br\/>The establishment of student councils in primary and post primary schools to give students a voice.

Accordingly, no consideration is being given to the creation of a special purpose vehicle or to the abolition of Irish Water. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100084#WRBB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Administration","counter":1162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100084#WRBB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1163,"qnumday":490,"qnumall":"[42837\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100084#WRBB01600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of outstanding contracts with outside companies currently entered into by Irish Water; the companies involved; the expiry date of these contracts; and their overall monetary value.","asker":"1096","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1164,"content":"<p>Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.

The report also identified significant non-compliance among those with responsibilities under the current Waste Tyre Regulations.  To address these significant shortcomings, my Department has been working, in full consultation with all parts of the tyre industry, to assist it in putting in place a system of producer responsibility, in line with those that apply to other sectors, to provide for the collection, sorting and management of the waste they produce in an environmentally sound manner.  This is in line with the &ldquo;polluter pays principle&rdquo; which is a firmly established feature of both domestic waste policy and legislation.  This will require an overhaul of existing structures, but I believe that this can be achieved without distorting the tyres market in Ireland, without encouraging customers to buy tyres outside of the jurisdiction and without widespread job losses.  Moreover, I believe that such a scheme could be provided for without introducing any new costs, but rather by effectively formalising the existing charge that is already applied to almost all tyre purchases.<\/p><p>  Arising from the work of the Tyres Working Group, which includes representatives from across the waste and tyres industries, my Department has now received proposals for the future management of waste tyres from the Independent Tyre Wholesalers and Retailers Association (ITWRA) and the Irish Tyre Industry Association (ITIA).  While it would have been my preference for all sides within the industry to come together in support of a single proposal, the separate proposals are being considered by my Department.  I expect to receive recommendations arising from this consideration very soon and, once I have made my decision, I will engage once more with all sides of the tyre industry to collaborate in putting in place the detailed legislative underpinning for the operation and enforcement of the new system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100085#WRCC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greenhouse Gas Emissions","counter":1208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100085#WRCC01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1209,"qnumday":505,"qnumall":"[43070\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100085#WRCC01600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the contingency plans and budget he has put in place to address the possibility that Ireland may not meet its legally binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets under the EU effort sharing decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1210,"content":"<p>Pursuant to the EU Effort-Sharing Decision of 2009 ( <i>Decision No. 406\/2009\/EC<\/i>), Ireland has ambitious, legally binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for\u00a0each year between\u00a02013\u00a0and 2020 inclusive.  Under the Decision, emissions in the year 2013 should be no more than the average of those same emissions in the years 2008 to 2010.\u00a0 In the year 2020, the target is that emissions should be 20 per cent below their value in 2005.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020.  Over-achievement in any one year can be used in any other year where there is under-achievement.  Furthermore, there are various other flexible mechanisms available to Member States to reach their targets such as Certified Emissions Reductions, that is, the unit of the Clean Development Mechanism as defined under the Kyoto Protocol, along with the inter-Member State trading of units.<br\/><br\/>The EPA has recently projected that Ireland's cumulative distance to target for the period 2013-2020 will range between 1 and 17 Mt CO2e for the period as a whole.  In the event that the units currently held in the national portfolio are not sufficient to meet any deficit, it is possible that Ireland may acquire additional compliance units from other Member States or through the carbon markets.  Analysis by my Department suggests that this eventuality, should it arise, will not arise until 2020 or thereafter.<br\/><br\/>The extent of the challenge posed by these emission reduction targets is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development and the General Scheme of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill, both of which were published in April this year.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by the Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy.  Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the General Scheme of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill.<br\/><br\/>In anticipation of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a low-carbon plan - the National Low-Carbon Roadmap to 2050 - the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures and identify additional measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low-carbon transition agenda.  As I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the annual mitigation targets in the first half of the 2013 to 2020 compliance period, the immediate focus of the national low-carbon road - mapping process will be the compliance challenge in the years 2017 to 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100085#WRCC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Charges Administration","counter":1211,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100085#WRCC01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1212,"qnumday":506,"qnumall":"[43091\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100085#WRCC01800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Clare who has twice requested an application form through the e-mail service and who received an acknowledgement on 16 October 2014 confirming that the application form was issued will receive said form for Irish Water; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As such, third level students who have moved away from home to an alternative primary residence will be liable for water charges.  Management companies of student accommodation are already categorised as non-domestic customers for water services.  Local authorities, acting as agents of Irish Water, continue to bill non-domestic customers and therefore continue to bill such companies who recover this cost via the fees charged for the accommodation.

It is anticipated that &euro;10m will be drawn down by the scheme in 2014.

The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5bn in network upgrades and at least 1.6m of the 2.3m addresses in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next number of years.  In the last month alone, two companies have announced projects to deliver direct fibre connectivity to approximately 500,000 homes and businesses in every county in Ireland including Ballina, Westport and Castlebar in County Mayo.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the National Broadband Plan is to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of where they are located, benefits from a high quality, high speed broadband service.  This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments, such as those I have already mentioned, and a State-led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.<\/p><p>  Under EU State Aid Guidelines Member States cannot intervene where commercial investors have plans to roll out services.  My Department is currently finalising a national map which will identify those areas that require a State intervention.

It includes 104 areas in County Mayo including Hollymount.<\/p><p>  I understand that at least one operator has published a programme to roll out fibre based broadband networks in 39 locations in County Mayo by July 2016.<\/p><p>  As part of the mapping process, a stakeholder consultation was launched in June.  32 submissions have been received and non-commercially sensitive versions of these responses were published by my Department last month.<\/p><p>  I expect to publish the map shortly.  Those accessing this map will be able to identify their own house or premises and see whether it is in the proposed intervention footprint.  Where a house or premises is not in the proposed intervention area it means it either currently, or will in the near future, have access to commercial high speed broadband services.  The map will be subject to change as new information becomes available or commercial investments are announced in the future.<\/p><p>  A further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy will be launched in mid-2015.  My Department is also working closely with the European Commission with a view to obtaining State Aid clearance for the programme.<\/p><p>  A detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a potential preferred bidder or bidders towards the end of 2015.<\/p><p>  This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government.

In that regard, our main objective is to ensure that the 2015 event will be a fitting tribute to those who perished in Ulster during the Great Famine and my Department continues to work with the key stakeholders, North and South, within that framework.<\/p><p>  I hope it will be possible for a definitive decision to be made shortly in relation to the location and associated arrangements for 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100090#WRHH02600","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"question","counter":1438,"qnumday":586,"qnumall":"[42955\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100090#WRHH02700","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if, in resect of the space reserved at Collins' Barracks, Dublin 7 to host an exhibition on the Great Irish Famine, if there are plans to facilitate this project being implemented; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"947","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1439,"content":"<p>Any decision in relation to an exhibition in Collins' Barracks, Dublin 7 is an operational matter for the National Museum of Ireland.  However, the National Famine Commemoration Committee, which I chair, has considered the possibility of exhibiting a collection dedicated to the Irish Famine. The Committee was given to understand that much of the evidence relating to the Great Famine is statistical and pictorial and that there is insufficient material to support a dedicated exhibition as there are very limited numbers of artefacts that could be exhibited.  There are of course many local museums and other entities around the country that include displays relating to the Famine period. The Irish National Famine Museum at Strokestown Park, Co Roscommon, is an excellent example of such initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100090#WRHH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1440,"content":"<p>Question No. 587 answered with Question No. 585.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":1441,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100090#WRHH02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1442,"qnumday":588,"qnumall":"[43283\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100090#WRHH03000","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the position regarding a motion on 3 July 2012; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1443,"content":"<p>Since this Government has come into office, huge efforts have been made to solve the issue of the protection of Ireland's raised bog special areas of conservation within the framework of the Habitats Directive. This has included intense engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission. A long term compensation scheme was introduced to compensate cutters for their loss.  The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan was published in January. It sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. The draft Plan sets out the demanding tests which must be met before turf cutting could be consented to within the provisions of the Directive. The final Plan will clarify whether the relevant provisions of the Directive could be applicable for any particular special area of conservation and will seek to establish whether sufficient consensus can be achieved at a national level to make a successful case to the European Commission for flexibility in accordance with Article 6(4) of the Directive.<\/p><p>  This National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan responds to the central recommendation of Mr. Justice Quirke arising out of the 2012 Peatlands Forum and as requested in the resolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of 7 March 2012 which called on the Government to &quot;engage actively with the European Commission to seek a resolution within the terms of the Habitats Directive, and to prepare and submit a National Raised Bog Restoration Plan to the Commission as a matter of urgency.&quot;<\/p><p>  Final resolution of all issues in relation to the protection of Ireland's raised bog Special Areas of Conservation will only be brought by everyone working together - within the law - with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established with the purpose of ensuring the input from all stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111100090#WRHH03100","answer":true,"speaker":"973"}]
