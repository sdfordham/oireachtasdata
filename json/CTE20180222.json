He is accompanied by Ms Patricia Devlin, the deputy director of audit in his office.  Apologies have been received from Deputies McDonald, Cassells, Aylward and Farrell.  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 15 February 2018.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  The next item is matters arising from the minutes.  I have one question in this regard.  We wrote to the HSE a week or two ago about salary overpayments.  Has any response been received?  I understand we will have a reply to that next week.  That is grand.  It may or may not be a significant item.  We will wait and see.  We will move on to correspondence received.  We have some correspondence today.<\/p> <p>  The first item of correspondence is No. 1105A, briefing material from the Revenue Commissioners for today's meeting.  We will note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  No. 1107A is briefing material on corporation tax from Dr. Brian Keegan of Chartered Accountants Ireland for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish that and circulate it to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, both of which may also have an interest in it.<\/p> <p>  Under category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow-up to previous meetings of this committee, No. 1081 was received on 12 February last from the Higher Education Authority.  It comprises a follow-up review report, carried out by Dr. Richard Thorn, regarding certain matters and allegations relating to the University of Limerick.  We mentioned this last week.  Dr. Graham Love has requested that the report be dealt with confidentially and that it not be published.  He has also mentioned that there are three related ongoing High Court actions.  Having checked with the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser here in Leinster House, we have circulated the report.  I propose that we will respect the request for confidentiality and therefore will not publish it.  The report is available to members but is not being published.  I ask members not to publish or circulate it by any other means.  We will note the item for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1519290000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Do we have any idea of the timelines for the High Court cases that have been mentioned?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#B00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1519290000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>No.  We could not know that at this stage, in fairness. <\/p> <p>No. 1087, is a letter from Mr. John O'Sullivan, who is the chief executive and commissioner of valuation.

I have marked item No. 8 on the correspondence in question and I want to raise it now.  We asked her for a written explanatory note on how the figure for temporary rehabilitation remuneration is calculated.  I was keen to know how they calculate this figure when people are out for extended periods on temporary remuneration for rehabilitation purposes.  She wrote back to say that regulation 6 \"provides that the rate of pay of temporary rehabilitation remuneration is the same as the rate of pension that the individual would be paid if they were to be ill-health retired\".  In other words, I asked her how her office calculates this and she wrote to say that it calculates it in the same way that it calculates something else.  We will have to go back to ask her to give us a specific information note on how this figure is calculated.  It is not enough to say it is calculated in the same way as something else if we do not know how the something else is calculated either.

It is up to policymakers to set down what changes should be made and not Deloitte.  I have no difficulty with Deloitte publishing a report setting out the problems.  I have a difficulty if the university and the HEA are suggesting that the recommendations to fix problems will come from Deloitte.  I do not accept that at all.

I have met some of the workers and unions involved on this outside of my work on this committee.  I am sure other members have as well.  This is something the unions raised with me.  The Pensions Authority was informed on 4 September 2009 that the scheme was no longer in compliance with the statutory funding standard as set out in Part 5 of the Pensions Act.<\/p> <p>  In the wake of the financial crisis the authority adopted a general policy of allowing schemes extra time to enter into a funding proposal, which they were required to do.  Has the Pensions Authority the right to override what is a statutory instrument?  That is what seems to have happened here.  A separate briefing document, prepared for CI&Eacute; and released under an FOI request, was given to the secretariat.  It is not in the pack for this week.  I think it was sent yesterday.  It refers to CI&Eacute; pensions and superannuation schemes.  One paragraph refers to the board's responsibilities as set out in the statutory base rules.  It goes on to say that independent legal advice would suggest it would be difficult for the board to ignore the advice recommended by the authority, unless there was some compelling reason to believe that the authority's recommendation was flawed.  There is no reason to believe the data on which the valuation is based is incorrect.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions.  Does the authority have the right to override what is a statutory instrument?  The second and bigger issue is one the unions are asking us to try to establish.  Is there a policy in CI&Eacute; to engage in deliberately underfunding the defined pension scheme in an effort to make it insolvent at some point?

Correspondence No. 1092C from an individual dated 16 February regarding the sale of land by the congregation of Christian Brothers at Clonkeen College in Blackrock in County Dublin.  The individual wrote to the committee regarding this matter last year.  We sent the response from the Department of Education and Skills to the individual.  The person has now asked the committee to look at the role of the Department of Education and Skills arising from its failure to safeguard fully the State's investment in schools that were built on land owned by third parties, and in particular on lands owned by religious orders.<\/p> <p>  This may be an interesting point.  I propose we write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for an information note on the models used to protect capital investment by the State on land owned by private or charity entities.  This has far reaching effects, with the State investing money in lands not in its ownership.  A local authority would not build a house on land it did not have the title deeds to.  We want to get a note from Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on that.  We will come back to that broad issue.  Agreed.  <\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence 1093 from Deputy Alan Kelly suggesting amendments to our working document in relation to our report.

The chapter is on corporation tax.  It is important that members of the public remember that corporation tax accounted for 15% of total tax receipts in 2016.  This tax has displayed considerable volatility in recent years.  Some 70% of all corporation tax is paid by the top 100 companies, and 37% by just ten companies.  Such a concentration represents a serious risk to the Exchequer and the payment for public services in the years ahead.  The committee wishes to understand fully this risk and how it might best be dealt with.<\/p><p>The area of corporation tax in a global economy is complex and poorly understood by many people.  Dr. Brian Keegan, director of public policy on taxation with Chartered Accountants Ireland, was contracted by the committee to provide a briefing to it to develop its understanding.  In our first session last week, in private session, he gave us a briefing.  We are here today to provide that briefing in public session for the benefit of the public who want to follow the discussion.  He is accompanied today by Ms Norah Collender, also from the institute.  In the afternoon, we will have further engagement with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance to bring our consideration of this matter to a conclusion for now.<\/p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

Members will have received our briefing document on corporation tax.  I am happy to provide any further explanations and whatever clarifications I can in the course of the meeting this morning.  I am joined today by my colleague Ms Norah Collender.<\/p> <p>  Any charge to tax on companies in Ireland hinges on the concept of residence.  All developed countries operate residence rules by virtue of the place of incorporation, or the place of management and control, or a hybrid arrangement.  In Ireland, the charge to corporation tax is, first and foremost, based on the place of incorporation.  A company incorporated here is tax resident here.  <\/p> <p>  In Ireland, the headline corporation tax rate is 12.5%, but other rates also apply to companies.  Investment or passive income is taxed at a rate of 25%.  Capital gains &mdash; namely profits arising from the sale of a capital asset, such as land or buildings &mdash; are taxed at 33%.  Many companies are subject to further surcharges on profits, and these companies are known as close companies.  The majority of companies in Ireland are close.  Close companies are defined as companies that are owned and controlled by a small group of people; often they are family ventures.<\/p> <p>  The Irish tax system operates to ensure that, all else being equal, it is more costly in tax terms for a business to operate through a company compared to operating the business through sole ownership, even though the prevailing company rate of 12.5% is far lower than the top rate of income tax, 40%, plus USC and PRSI.  That is because money leaving the company is taxed under the income tax regime while money remaining in the company is taxed under the corporation tax regime and then potentially surchargeable at a rate up to 20%.<\/p> <p>  One of the consequences of the close company legislation is that relatively few companies in Ireland pay corporation tax, and those that do pay small amounts.  Most corporation tax is typically paid by non-close companies, that is, publicly quoted companies or multinationals.<\/p> <p>  There are other special classes of company that feature in the Irish tax system.  For example, real estate investment trusts allow investors purchase shares in investment property while taxing the returns as if the investors had directly bought the investment property and rented it themselves.  Charities are subject to an exemption from mainstream taxes.  A section 110 company is a particular type of company used to facilitate asset management in the International Financial Services Centre.<\/p> <p>  There are also particular tax regimes that can apply depending on the nature of the company's activities.  Incentives exist for investments in intellectual property, for the development of intellectual property through research and development, and for the exploitation of intellectual property recognised under the knowledge development box rules.  We have provided an outline of the rules applying to these special classes of companies and incentives in the briefing document.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Corporation Tax system also works within a framework of international agreements and conventions, not least our undertakings by virtue of our membership of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  No taxes can be modified by the European Union without unanimous agreement among the 28 EU member states.  In terms of corporation tax specifically, there exists a number of EU directives to ensure that, within the confines of EU member state borders, no double taxation accrues when EU-based companies pay each other dividends, royalties or interest, nor should there be a tax penalty when companies seek to merge their businesses across EU member state borders.<\/p> <p>  The EU treaties also provide for the safeguarding of four fundamental freedoms &ndash; the freedoms of movement of people, goods, services and capital.  All Irish law, not just corporation tax law, must be compliant with these principles.  Under the state aid rule, no country can grant a selective advantage to a company or to a sector of which other companies or sectors cannot avail.  <\/p> <p>  Beyond EU membership arrangements, Ireland is also party to more than 70 bilateral double taxation treaties, which attempt to ensure that a company cannot be taxed twice in two different jurisdictions on the same profits.  These relieving measures are mainly policed by systems of withholding taxation.  <\/p> <p>  To conclude these opening comments, we were asked to describe the discretion available to the Revenue Commissioners in the pursuit of their responsibilities under the taxes Acts.  In so far as Revenue officers have any discretion available to them, that discretion is circumscribed by the legislation.  We have described in the briefing note the main circumstances in which discretion or judgment might be applied.  I would be happy to expand on these further and, indeed, on any aspect of the briefing note.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1519290000,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Keegan.

I am interested in the section on transfer pricing.  That comes out of the report, Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Code, by Mr. Seamus Coffey.  If transfer pricing were to be extended to non-trading transactions that would include transfer pricing examination of matters such as renting property, how would that apply in respect of real estate investment trusts, REITs?  The witness has described withholding tax to us and the tax being liable.<\/p> <p>  I will put an example.  If 80% of shareholders were in one of the other European countries, essentially the tax liability, with the exception of the withholding tax liability, is in the country of their origin.  Would this recommendation in the Coffey report have any bearing on where the tax liability might fall?  We are seeing, in effect, property become mobile for the first time.  The understanding was that property was the one thing that could be taxed in one location and was not mobile.

The Deputy's conclusion, \"if at all\", is probably the answer.  When we speak of transfer pricing, we are normally speaking about transactions between connected companies, most often those under common ownership.  A REIT is by definition a kind of stand-alone management arrangement for a particular property or group of properties.  Transfer pricing arrangements might conceivably apply if two REITs were in common ownership in different jurisdictions.  I am not aware if that is a common structure.

Whether that would be permissible under EU rules which ensure no one sector can be favoured over another is a question that would really have to be teased out.  Having said that, there are procedures, and Ireland does this all the time, whereby we approach the European Union, say we are proposing to do this in our tax legislation and ask whether it is acceptable under state aid rules.

It relates, fundamentally, to the number of shareholders, that is, five or fewer.  The idea behind a close company is to ensure that individuals do not put their businesses through as a company and avail of a 12.5% rate instead of a 40% rate.  The laws are almost penal and are designed to ensure that if someone is incorporating a business in Ireland, he or she has to have very good commercial reasons to use a company structure and should not be doing so for tax purposes.  There are special rules to do with leaving moneys in the company whereby if they are not distributed out, they are surcharged.  There are special rules on how much money a director or shareholder can take out of the company without a tax penalty and so on.  The combined effect of all those rules is that it is much more efficient for close companies to pay out their profits by way of salaries to the participators.  Therefore, those profits, which one might expect to be taxed under corporation tax rules, are actually taxed under the income tax rules because they are paid out by way of salary or ultimately, by way of dividend.  That happens because it is tax inefficient to do otherwise because the tax system is designed to ensure it is inefficient to do otherwise.  The consequence of that is that the bulk of corporation tax is paid by more widely held companies which typically, by definition, are bigger companies.  They tend to be multinationals and they tend to be publicly quoted.  Due to the nature of the economic environment in which we all find ourselves, an increasing amount of the value and profitability of the corporate sector is derived from intellectual property.  By contrast, 100 years ago the profitability of the corporate sector was mainly derived from the holding of natural resources.  Things have moved on and it is those industries which have a very high reliance on intellectual property, like the pharmaceutical and ITC sectors, that are making the big money now.  It is a by-product of economic factors on the one hand and the particular structure in Ireland on the other.  The Irish structure is pretty unique in terms of how it actually penalises individuals.  The UK started off with a similar set of arrangements in the 1970s, which have been very much watered down since, but we have retained the strict close company regime and that is a big factor in explaining why there are relatively few companies paying corporation tax.  It is not that tax is not being paid or that Irish companies are not making profits but that the tax on those profits tends to be collected through the income tax as distinct from the corporate tax system.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#J03400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Keegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519290000,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Most tax comes from the PAYE system-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#K00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519290000,"counter":293,"content":"<p>That is right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1519290000,"counter":294,"content":"<p>----- and within the PAYE system, close companies pay tax through salaries that are taxed.

One of the reliefs, to which Deputy Catherine Murphy alluded earlier, is based on losses being carried forward.  Where a business has incurred losses in previous years, it can carry those losses forward and offset them against the taxable profits in the current period or a future period.  That is certainly a contributing factor.  There are also provisions whereby if a company engages in capital investment like buying new plant or machinery or intellectual property - things like copyrights, patents, trademarks and so forth - it can use the money expended on those capital assets to reduce the amount of profit that is subject to tax.  That is above the line, so to speak, and one comes up with the taxable figure and tax is charged at 12.5% or 25%, as appropriate.  However, below-the-line credits can arise, mainly in two areas.  They can arise in terms of the indigenous tax credit for research and development, which is a huge factor in the Irish tax system.  It is very much tied up with the notion of intellectual property and therefore, by definition, it is tied up with those companies which tend to make the most money because of their economic structure.  We also operate a system of tax credits whereby if holding companies in Ireland are receiving a dividend from abroad, a credit attaches to those dividends by virtue of foreign tax paid by foreign subsidiaries, for example.  That would reduce the overall effective rate.<\/p> <p>  There are factors above the line that reduce the actual taxable profit and there are factors below the line which, after the tax is calculated, reduce the amount of tax payable.

It would be quite useful to hear about the changes that were made in the UK with regard to smaller companies.  Usually when there is a newspaper headline relating to corporate tax, the response is that a small number of companies pay the vast majority of corporate tax and that is actually the case.  However, Dr. Keegan has drawn a distinction between close companies and how their tax is treated and other companies.  In actual fact, we are not comparing like with like.  We are not talking about 107,000 companies being liable for corporate tax - only a portion of those companies are liable.  Dr. Keegan also described the tax treatment of close companies as \"penal\".  It could be viewed as an inhibitor in terms of Irish companies growing if we cannot apportion tax in a fair way and if some groups of companies are enjoying a disproportionately advantageous tax treatment in comparison with others.  Smaller or close companies appear to have a bigger hill to climb.  What changes did they make in the UK?

In very basic terms, the UK replaced its close company legislation with a procedure known as IR35.  That procedure allows Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to look through the corporate structure and tax the individuals as if the earnings of the company had arisen directly to themselves.  It is a much more convoluted structure.  The great advantage of our close company regime is that it is well defined and well understood.  When I say \"penal\", I should clarify what I mean.  If one is trying to game the system and trying to use the corporate structure to have profits taxed at 12.5% instead of at the income tax rate, one will get caught.  It is for that reason that Irish business owners are careful to ensure that those rules are not triggered and that money is paid out and accounted for through the income tax system.  The net effect is probably the same but the revenue authorities in the UK found they had to impose the IR35 mechanism to effectively undo the undoing that they had done on their close company regime.

For example, there used to be a system known as free depreciation whereby if a company bought an asset, it could write the full cost of that asset straight off against its tax liability.

If one is an employee, one is engaged by an employer to provide under a contract for services.  An employee also has all kinds of entitlements under the employment and labour laws and protections that exist within the State's ambit.  If one is providing a contract of services, for example, if one is trying to operate through a company, then one no longer has those kinds of protection.  That is one aspect of it.<\/p> <p>  I will use a simple example to show how it works in practice.  Let us say that I was to incorporate my business and that, instead of invoicing as Brian Keegan, I invoiced as Brian Keegan Limited.  It would simply be a matter for me of putting the work through the company.  The company would keep its own books and records.  Invoices would be issued from Brian Keegan Limited and that money would belong to Brian Keegan Limited.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, I would be paid a salary by the company.  In so far as the profits of the company were not extinguished from the salary, those profits would be liable to tax at 12.5%.  The wrinkle, which links with the previous questions on close company rules, is that, if I leave the money that was taxed at 12.5% in the company, it becomes liable to a surcharge of 20% after 18 months.  For me to avoid that, I would have to pay out the money I had left in the company by way of a dividend, in which case it would be immediately taxable under the income tax rules.  These are all of the wrinkles.<\/p> <p>  As I said in private session, when I am asked by individuals from time to time whether it is worth their while to incorporate, I always tell them not to do it for tax purposes.  If there is a commercial reason for doing it, for example, if they need the protection of limited liability, then by all means they should do it, but they should not do it for tax reasons because there is no tax advantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#M01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1519290000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Next is Deputy Murphy.

He has given us a summary note on the Coffey review, which was carried out by Seamus Coffey.  For the record, I understand Mr. Coffey made a presentation some time ago to the finance committee so I did not invite him here today to repeat what he has already said in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  What he said is reported on the record.  He makes a number of recommendations in the review, and we as a committee will take note of pages 42, 43 and 44 of Dr. Keegan's briefing relating to this.  We will not restate the recommendations.  They are already on the public record.  Mr. Coffey essentially highlights the risk to the taxpayer of over-reliance on this and talks about intellectual property, base erosion and profit shifting and transfer pricing.  Dr. Keegan's summary note on this is helpful to us.<\/p> <p>  I turn to page 45.  I refer to the issue of tax residency in the second paragraph.  I think I asked Dr. Keegan about this on the previous occasion while the committee was in private session.  An individual's tax residence can be primarily determined by their physical presence.  Generally an individual is considered to be resident for tax purposes in Ireland if they spend 183 days or more in Ireland in any one year.  That is six months.  I cite the example of someone who spends four months in one country, four months in another country and four months somewhere else.  He or she is not resident for tax purposes anywhere.  I know Dr. Keegan will say he or she pays tax on the income generated in each of those areas, but a clever person could have the majority of his or her income somewhere else and not be tax resident anywhere.  That can happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#O02100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519290000,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I cannot think of a reason it might not.

In parallel, agreement was reached shortly after we last met the company in terms of the framework.  That was approved by the company at board level and by Government in January.  Our minds have been concentrated in recent weeks in supporting the NTMA in terms of its procurement process.  We are at the stage now where we thought we would be, that is to say, the process for the appointment of the custodian agent to receive the funds is almost complete.  We have entered the standstill period, which runs for up to 14 days.  We expect to make an announcement shortly on the identification of the agent that will manage the moneys for us.<\/p> <p>  In parallel, there is a process of procuring the services of investment managers.  We expect this process, which is rather advanced, will be completed through the course of early March.  Once we have contracts signed, all of that will allow for the custodian to put the accounts in place to capture the money and for the investment managers to be active in managing the money.

The frustration is that even though the 12.5% is generous, in some cases only a tiny proportion of that ends up being paid.<\/p> <p>  We are told that research and development is the main area against which tax can be set aside.  I imagine that there is a limited amount of research and development that can be put into financial and insurance activities.  However, one could lose a fortune in pharmaceutical manufacturing because there is ongoing development of new drugs which we are told is very expensive.  Is there a bit of a conundrum in that we are giving very generous research and development write-offs for, for example, the pharmaceutical sector, when we have some of the most expensive drugs in the world.  Does that get factored into the approach to research and development in that particular sector, for example?  I do not think it is possible to say it is the same with other sectors.

I think it was evaluated in 2016.  I will confirm with Mr. Hession if that is correct.  From our assessment of the effect of the overall tax credit, we were seeing 60% additionality in terms of research and development activity in the State as a result of the availability of the credit.  When that is considered in terms of industrial policy, we are complementing where we would like to see our economy going, which is creating high value and well paid employment opportunities for young educated people who are coming from our universities and so on.<\/p><p> To draw the thread from the individual research and development tax credit right down to the pricing policy is quite difficult, however.  Even at that, its benefit is that it is a general measure available across the economy, depending on the level of research and development activity undertaken.

It is a big set aside.  Yet, at the same time, on the other end, we do not get any advantage.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to another area that we explored.  It relates to real estate investment trusts, REITs.  Last week we explored this with the tax consultant who has been assisting us.  For example, in the case of a real estate investment trust, we are told the only real tax that is paid is paid by the company that is managing it, although it is not the only tax.  Most of the tax liability will be on the shareholders, that is, the people who own the shares.  If they are 90% in France, they pay 20% withholding tax here and are liable for the tax, with the 20% discounted, in France.  I use that as an example.<\/p> <p>  We are now moving into a situation where property has become mobile whereas it had been a thing one could guarantee was fixed.  How does that relate to people who own property here and would be liable to pay tax on it here, for example?  Is the way this is handled encouraging a different type of ownership?  Many of these might have bought assets cheaply and may well be competing in an entirely different way with people who are, say, accidental landlords in terms of their tax treatment.  Is there an evaluation or a modelling of that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#MM00500","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519290000,"counter":501,"content":"<p>The logic behind the tax treatment of REITs and other investment vehicles is that one wants to put the investor in the same position as someone who, say, just bought a house and rented it out.  With funds taxation, we are saying that there will be a double layer of tax law without some adjustment to the tax law.  This is because the fund will pay tax and then the individual will pay income tax on his or her drawdown.  In general, funds taxation in OECD countries is about stripping out what would otherwise be a double layer of taxation.  REITs are generally new builds and they have to adopt a particular model.  For example, 85% of their profit has to be paid out.  It cannot retain the profit in the fund and avoid taxation.  It has to be pumped out of the fund.  The Deputy is right that there is a 20% withholding tax and the investor will then pay income tax in the same way as the Deputy or I would pay tax on rental income from a house we had bought.<\/p> <p>  A couple of years ago a problem was brought to our attention by our colleagues in Revenue.  The use of funds in the area of property was creating a risk to the Irish tax base.  In the Irish tax system and international tax system, one always retains the taxing right to property in one's jurisdiction.  One should not let that leak out of one's base.  There was a concern that structures were available to some of the property developments and those buying distressed loans - the Deputy referred to those who were in the so-called section 110 companies - where Ireland was at risk that the tax rights to property was leaking out of our base, with consequent unfairness to other types of investors.  There was a general sense that the tax system was not designed to allow that type of leakage.<\/p> <p>  Therefore, a number of changes were made two Finance Bills ago to ensure, first, that section 110 companies could not avoid tax.  They were not allowed to sweep the profits out.  They are subject to a 25% tax rate.   They pay the investor rate rather than the lower 12.5% rate.  When it came to property, that got taxed at 25%.  In terms of other types of funds, where they had investors overseas, we took the 20% withholding tax that was on REITs and applied it to those types of funds.  They are Irish real estate funds, IREFs.  These funds have a reasonable component, that is, a 25% component, of Irish property.<\/p> <p>  The issue the Deputy raised is very germane to the tax policy debate in the last number of Finance Bills.  It is an area in which changes have been made.  We will start to see what difference it has made to the figures this year as the tax returns come in.  Given what we understand from their public information, we expect that some of them will move out of funds structures and perhaps incorporate as regular companies, which is as it should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#MM00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession"},{"type":"speech","time":1519290000,"counter":502,"content":"<p>On banks and bank debt, not that long ago we saw a newspaper headline that one of the banks which had the benefit of surviving as a consequence of citizens bailing it out was not expected to pay any tax for the next 20 years.

If I find at home a medical receipt from five years ago, as an individual taxpayer I would not be able to seek to write that off against my tax liability.  I can well understand that companies will write off debt over time, but then there is the idea that this can be indeterminate, particularly for a sector which had the benefit of the public bailing it out.

We have seen the analysis Revenue published last year of the level of losses in the system.  Overall, it is declining somewhat, but it is still very high, both in the banking sector and the corporate sector more widely.  The banks obviously are carrying massive losses.  Previously, the way that issue was approached was they were limited to only being able to offset them against half of their profits every year, but that became a problem a number of years ago when new European regulatory requirements under the capital requirements directive were introduced.  That would have meant it would have required an injection of capital from the State into the banks to correct it.  I think the policy change was made in 2014 to remove the restriction which at that stage was unique to the banking sector; other corporate sectors were not subject to it.  Instead, the banking levy was introduced.  I have to be careful not to stray into commenting on the merits of policy; I will just try to explain how the system works and why it is the way it is.  The restriction on banks' ability to offset losses against profits was removed at the time, but in order to ensure revenue was still collected from the banking sector, the banking levy was introduced.  It was due to expire in 2016 but was extended to 2020 or 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#NN00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession"},{"type":"speech","time":1519290000,"counter":505,"content":"<p>What does it bring in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#NN00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519290000,"counter":506,"content":"<p>It brings in &euro;150 million a year.

In other words, rather than wait for the tax revenue, the banks have a valuable deferred tax asset for which investors are prepared to pay now.

As Mr. Hession stated, when they were put in place, it really had to do with international securitisation; there was no risk to Irish taxation.  We would keep an eye on what was happening and would have a very close relationship with the Central Bank on an operational level, subject to the legislation in place on the exchange of information.  It was in that context that in 2015 we identified the issue of property transactions within section 110 companies.  We started a process to look at their use for Irish property transactions.  That process continued through 2015 and 2016 and led to changes in the legislation to target the amount mentioned.  As Mr. Hession stated, some of the issues are related to the level of information we receive.  Our powers in that regard were increased to ensure we had greater sight of what was going on.  That work is continuing.  It is the ongoing job of a tax administration system to constantly look at what is going on.  Sometimes it will take us a while to get our heads around what we are seeing.

I tabled two parliamentary questions on the issue in the past week or so.  I tabled one last night and one on 13 February.  I asked for a breakdown of the tax credit based on different bands of tax payment by various companies.  I got some information in one reply and more in another on the number of people involved.  It was 1,535 companies for 2015 and 1,486 companies were able to claim R&amp;D tax credit in 2016.  The range of credit available by way of reduction in tax for those between &euro;1 and &euro;50,000 was 797 people.  They were the small guys.  I have information on the companies ranging from &euro;50,000 to &euro;100,000.  The one people will be interested in is that Revenue said 13 companies were able to claim the R&amp;D tax credit where the reduction of tax was in excess of &euro;5 million in each of the 13 cases.  I asked for the figures over &euro;10 million and &euro;50 million but, understandably, Mr. Cody said he would not give that information as it might identify the taxpayer and he aggregated the numbers over &euro;5 million and that came to a total of 13 companies.<\/p> <p>  The first question related to the number of companies and the second question dealt with the amount of money.  The Minister for Finance gave me the information but I am sure Revenue had an input into the reply.  On the amount of corporation tax in respect of amounts payable over &euro;5 million, which was 13 companies, the amount involved in 2016 was &euro;440 million, which represented 65% of the total.  I think I am correct in saying that.  In total, 13 companies out 1,486, less than 1% of the companies, were able to claim research and development tax credit in the amount of &euro;450 million out of a total of &euro;674 million in 2016, which was 65% of the total.  Mr. Cody gave the figures of 80% and 40% but in reality when I look at the figures less than 1% of the companies have claimed 65% of the research tax credit on the basis that they are doing the most research.  There is a logic to it, but I still want to put the figures out there.  Part of our remit is to provide information to the public so that they can understand the corporation tax situation a little bit better.<\/p> <p>  Those companies between &euro;1 million and &euro;5 million had R&amp;D tax credit available to them of more than &euro;100 million and there were only 49 companies in that group.  Understandably, when I look at those two groups and all of the companies that were able to avail of the tax credits I work out that there are 188 companies over the four years, which gives an average of 50 companies per annum, that were able to claim &euro;1.816 billion out of a total of &euro;2.356 billion, namely 81%.  The figures I was given relate to 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.  An average of 40 companies has claimed more than 80% of the credit over the four years.  That is a quite a lot in those particular areas and I wish to highlight that.<\/p> <p>  On the top 13 companies that I mentioned that were able to get 65% of the amount in 2016, it was an average of &euro;34 million per company.  Some of them might have been just over it and others were way over it.  I estimated the average for those companies was &euro;34 million in 2016 and &euro;36 million in 2015.  I think I am correct in my interpretation of those replies to my parliamentary questions.  If that is Mr. Cody's general understanding we will not quibble over it.  I want to put that on the record because we all talk about the 1,400, the majority of which are small companies but they are getting peanuts in terms of the value of the tax credit.  I do not dispute the value I just want people to have a good understanding of those tax credits.<\/p> <p>  We wrote to Mr. Cody last weekend and we appreciate that we gave him short notice to provide a reply.  He was good, as I think he has replied to each of the six questions we asked last week.  We have the briefing note in front of us since yesterday.  Some of the replies were easy to come by as they were taken from the annual reports and others probably required a bit of extra work.  I wish to hone in on one which we have touched on already, namely, corporation tax and carrying losses forward.  Losses forward are covered in Appendix No. 7 in the documentation supplied.  The information is on screen now.  That is where companies that had incurred losses in previous years can carry the losses forward against profits in a future year to reduce their tax liability.  We have mentioned the banks already in our general discussion on this issue.  The total amount on the schedule that I have been given for companies and corporations in Ireland carrying forward losses against future tax liabilities &ndash; I ask people to wait for this figure &ndash; I think I am right when I say it - is &euro;218 billion, not million.  That is losses forward by the corporate sector to be offset against profits in future years.  We are told &euro;40 billion relates to losses that are not expected to be used because those companies might be in liquidation but they had losses forward going into liquidation.  That still leaves &euro;178 billion of losses forward in the corporate sector to be offset against future corporation tax receipts.  Mr. Cody can understand why the PAC is concerned about the receipts and potential risk to the taxpayer of that big overhang.  Obviously the biggest sector of that is the financial and insurance activities which involves &euro;124 billion, and that is the majority of the amount.<\/p> <p>  For the record, my reading of that is a fair representation.  It is important that when we are drafting a report our facts are correct.  I was staggered by the scale of the amounts involved.  It is probably not news to some of the witnesses but it is a phenomenal figure that has not perhaps been discussed in the public arena.<\/p><p>We do not expect it to be carried forward next year, with no corporation tax received.  In my letter to the witnesses, I was really asking for an age analysis of this.  How far back does this go?  Is it recent or does it go back over five, ten, 15 or 20 years?  Did the witnesses say they could not provide an age analysis and that the data is not collected in that manner?  Some of this could conceivably be very old and there might not be much prospect of recovery.  However, I would have thought that an age analysis would be available.  How much of that &euro;218 billion is from last year or from the year before?  I know some comes forward each year and is utilised each year.  I am surprised and a bit disappointed that the witnesses have not been able to provide an age analysis.  It would have helped to inform public debate on corporation tax.  I also feel it is important in light of the facts we mentioned with regard to some of the key banks in terms of the rule changes involving ECB issues and capital ratios.  The banks may not be paying corporation tax for many a year to come if there is that level of losses forward in the system.<\/p><p> Has the Department of Finance considered a sunset clause on the losses forward?  Most people have a period of time to draw down money, but the idea that these losses can be carried forward indefinitely is probably not fair to the taxpayer into the future.  It has the potential to have a significant impact. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#QQ02000","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519290000,"counter":636,"content":"<p>Not to my recollection.

That report did not make any recommendation in terms of change in the treatment of losses.  It does not surprise us that it was not a feature of the submissions that have since come in.<\/p> <p>  The issue of losses arises, of course.  It is an enormous amount.  In the analysis of the 2015 corporation tax receipts was published by Revenue, which has since been updated to show the picture for 2016, we see that there are some 8,000 companies which have worked through losses and are starting to pay corporation tax.  It is one of the factors driving the sustained increase in corporation tax receipts.  To some extent the hangover from the financial and economic crisis is starting to work its way out of the system.  We have not looked at a sunset clause in terms of the use of losses.

I am surprised that the review the Minister commissioned was solely based on the recommendations of the Coffey report and that it was so restricted, it seems, because one person did not make a recommendation on it.  I am surprised that the review conducted did not go there.  The fact that it was not in the published consultation documents probably explains why so few submissions were received.  Do the witnesses accept that there is a valid issue there?  It seems to me there is a lack of information available from the Department of Finance and from Revenue in terms of how far back this goes.  The issue has been relevant in recent debates, with the banks being allowed to carry losses forward.

The timing concerned the collapse of the economy, and there was a massive increase in losses, so we had to capture that risk to the corporation tax base.  We have figures going back.

It is extraordinary to hear of the concentration in a small number of companies of much of the &euro;200 billion in losses carried forward.  It is not good for a country the size of Ireland to have that level of losses carried forward in the hands of a small number of companies because, as has been pointed out, it would give such companies a higher takeover value.  For a company with a big corporation tax liability seeking to take over another company, a loss of hundreds of millions carried forward would probably be a more valuable asset than the takeover company itself.  Ireland is in an odd position in that regard.  We are here to discuss the level of risk this poses to the Exchequer because that is the essence of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.

The second reason, which we spoke about earlier, was that they may have claimed research and development tax credits.<\/p><p>On the foreign dividends, Ireland applies a credit system to ensure that foreign source income, including foreign dividends, is not doubly taxed.  This means that an Irish resident company in receipt of foreign dividends is chargeable to Irish tax on that income at 12.5% or 25% depending on the country from which it is paid and whether the dividends are paid out of trading profits.  Where certain criteria are met, however, a credit will be available against Irish tax in respect of any foreign withholding tax applied in the country of payment, as well as in respect of foreign tax suffered and the profits out of which the dividend has been paid.<\/p><p> We have provided a table to show what the effective rate would be if they were not entitled to the foreign tax credit.

The group comprises a significant number of Votes as follows: the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform andseveral offices under its aegis, namely, the State Laboratory, the Public Appointments Service, the National Shared Services Office and the Office of the Ombudsman.  It includes the Votes for superannuation and retired allowances and the secret service.  The remaining Vote in the group, the Vote for the Office of Public Works, is handled separately by the sub-committee.<\/p> <p>  The committee has been supplied with a very detailed briefing document by my Department&rsquo;s officials on the various Votes.  Further detailed material is contained in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2018 which was prepared by my Department and published on 14 December 2017.  It is worth noting that the total net allocation for the 2018 Department of Public Expenditure and Reform group of Votes which comprises eight distinct Votes shows a very modest increase of 2% on the 2017 allocation.  The 2018 overall net figure of &euro;520.9 million compares to a figure of &euro;510.2 million in 2017.  A difference of &euro;6.2 million is reflected in the superannuation Vote for 2018.<\/p> <p>  The structure of the Vote remains unchanged in 2018, with two strategic programmes focused on public expenditure and sectoral policy and public service management and reform.  The requested resources for each programme, in terms of staffing and funding, are set out in Part III of the Estimate.  In 2018 we are seeking a 6% increase in the gross spend under the Vote, bringing the total gross allocation to &euro;59.531 million.  The increase is required primarily for the second programme - public service management and reform - as my Department continues to roll out a comprehensive programme of reform.  It is largely related to the provision for investment in a resilient and robust technical platform from which to deliver build-to-share applications as part of the remit of the Office of Government Chief Information Officer; the provision for the funding of the Civil Service learning and development shared services project; an additional provision for the design of an administrative system to support the implementation of the single public service pension scheme and the funding of the next phase of work of the Public Service Pay Commission.<\/p> <p>  On Programme B of the Vote, public service management and reform, members will recall that I had the opportunity to discuss the next phase with the committee during my appearance last week.  Nevertheless, I once again draw members&rsquo; attention to the main points of the new framework which I launched last December.  There has been progress since the first reform programme was started in 2011 in areas which include procurement, shared services and Civil Service renewal, as well as public service reform, all of which continue to play a key role.  The key pillars are, first, delivering for the public; second, innovating for the future; and, third, developing people and the organisation.<\/p> <p>  Work continues to implement the actions included in the Civil Service renewal programme.  I published the third annual progress report last June which showed that much had been achieved under the programme of change since the plan had been initiated.  While the renewal plan was envisaged as a three-year programme of work and is being delivered on a phased basis, I see Civil Service renewal as an ongoing process.  We will continue to embed the changes across Departments and offices this year.<\/p> <p>  In addition to progress in implementing public service reform, we continue to pursue a wide-ranging reform programme aimed at delivering an open, accountable and ethical Government approach underpinned by a transparent and effective public service.  Key areas of focus are the data sharing and governance Bill; the open data strategy; and a statutory review of the operation of the Protected Disclosures Act of 2014 which will be published in the first half of 2018.<\/p> <p>  I will turn briefly to the issue of public service pay.  Last year when I briefed the committee, we were addressing the aftermath of the Labour Court's ruling on Garda pay and the undermining effect it had had on the Lansdowne Road agreement.  I outlined a two-phase process designed, first, to stabilise the Lansdowne Road agreement and then to negotiate a successor.  We have had success in following this approach.  The Government has negotiated the new agreement which is a significant achievement that will deliver the full dismantling of the financial emergency legislation in way that is affordable and that I believe is fair, but challenges remain.  The Public Service Pay Commission is examining recruitment and retention issues in the health sector.  Legacy issues associated with new entrant grades are also being examined and a report will be submitted to the Oireachtas by March.  Both issues are likely to prompt difficult discussions later in the year, but the current environment is largely stable.<\/p> <p>  As Minister with responsibility for the public service and public service reform, I am committed to ensuring we will continue to use digitisation to deliver more efficient and effective services.  Our own surveys have shown that people want to use more public services online.  We have seen a positive approach to using the digital services gateway and the public services card and MyGovID, demonstrating that the public understands the importance of having a reliable, authenticated and secure means of online verification.  We will continue this work when making services available throughout the year.  However, we also want to make sure no one who wants to transact business electronically will be left behind.  In that regard, we hope to announce some assisted digital initiatives later in the year.<\/p><p> In 2018 my Department will lead the second phase of the three-year spending review process which will take place in advance of the 2019 Estimates process.  It will build on the successful spending review in 2017 which culminated in the publication of more than 20 technical papers.  While moderate expenditure growth is planned, there continues to be many public service demands.  We must have a continual focus on the totality of spending to ensure public funds will have the maximum effect.  The intention is that the spending review process will help to broaden the Government's options in the budgetary process and assist in funding new policy measures.<\/p><p> As members will be aware, last Friday my Department published the national development plan.  The plan demonstrates the Government's commitment to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructural and investment needs.  It reflects an appropriate balance between the need for additional investment, the sustainable capacity of the economy and the need to adhere to responsible spending.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to present the Estimates.  I will be pleased to answer questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#B01100","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":840,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I never expected to utter those words.  On the question related to Brexit and cross-Border funding, I assure the Deputy that it is a major focus for me and my Department.  I will comment on the current position and what we would like to achieve in the future.  In the immediate aftermath of the referendum in the United Kingdom on leaving the European Union, my Department engaged with the British Treasury and I engaged extensively with the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB.  Our first priority has been to secure existing programmes which are worth more than &euro;500 million and will continue until 2020.  In the aftermath of the referendum on Brexit, concerns were expressed that difficulties could arise in the roll-out of the next phase of the funding plan.  We have addressed these concerns.<\/p><p>We have committed 73% of the funding available under the PEACE programme and 79 projects valued at &euro;176 million have been approved.  With regard to the INTERREG programme, the second major funding stream, we have committed 78% of the funding available under it and approved 27 projects valued at &euro;208 million.  My short-term priority was to ensure existing commitments were realised.  I am confident that the programmes in place until 2020 will be completed.  Beyond 2020, I am committed to implementing programmes to succeed the current INTERREG and PEACE programmes.  The Department is examining the legal basis for EU programmes that operate in Third Countries, in other words, those operating in non-EU countries in which the European Union has a strong interest.  I am committed to developing a means of maintaining this work.<\/p><p>The December statement on the Brexit negotiations included the following:<\/p><blockquote>Both parties will honour their commitments to the PEACE and INTERREG funding programmes under the current multi-annual financial framework.

I presume they must be made before 2020, given that preparations need to be made for these programmes well in advance of their commencement as they cannot be implemented at the last minute.  Yesterday the Committee on Budgetary Oversight met to discuss the equality budgeting process, which falls within the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

The first will be in May, when we expect a communication from the European Council on its proposals for the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework, MFF.  This is important because most of the funding used to underpin the programmes comes from the EU budget which will be determined by the new Multi-Annual Financial Framework which will have to be negotiated.  As to what we will do before and after that, my officials and I regularly engage with the Commission on what will be the precedent for implementing replacement programmes.  I have visited areas where a number of the programmes are in operation.  Some months ago, for example, I visited Derry where I observed the programmes in action.  While I was aware of some of the projects being undertaken under the PEACE and INTERREG programmes in counties Cavan and Monaghan, my support for this work was reaffirmed when I witnessed the tangible effects of the investments in addressing many of the difficulties still experienced by communities.<\/p> <p>  Funding for the equality proofing initiative is located across a variety of expenditure lines in the Department.

I have complained to the Minister previously about the absence of women in the room when his Department has been present, so I am delighted to welcome two women to the top table this morning and to acknowledge that there are other female officials in the audience as well.  There is a great deal of talent among women in the public service, but having that recognised fully in the Department of Finance has been difficult.<\/p> <p>  My second point affects both of our constituencies.  We all know that there are large numbers of young people who are either in college or have finished it and who are from ethnic minorities or have come from countries around the world to live in my constituency, which is the Minister's home area, and in his constituency, which is in many ways my home area.  I hope that the Department has a policy, through its influence on the recruitment process, to ensure that those young people, many of whom have done excellently in school and college, have a share of the opportunity to be recruited into the public service.  Some 30% of the people in various parts of Dublin are not originally from Ireland.  They or their parents came to live here.  In this light, it is time that we saw the fantastic diversity that exists in Dublin reflected in recruitment policy.  Just as it is odd not to see women present at the top table, it is equally odd not to see the diversity of Ireland.  It would be a reflection of our success story.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask about public service pay and section 39 organisations.  I am concerned about the hospice movement.  There are hospices in all of our major cities and right around the country, with several in Dublin.  There is a major hospice in Cork.  Since hospice staff members are employees of organisations governed by section 39 rules, they have been unable to access the increases that the Minister referred to in the context of the public pay restoration programme.  That programme has been long overdue and I was a part of the Government that introduced it, but I am disappointed that it does not cover the people who work in section 39 organisations, including organisations that provide vital services to persons in the broader health sector like Rehab, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Irish Hospice Association.  Unless the Minister finds a solution, at the end of the two-year period, which will be soon, there will be a 3% negative differential between the pay of a nurse who works in a hospice and one who has stayed working in a hospital, perhaps one that is close by or even on the same campus.  The same will hold true across sectors where there are health professionals, allied professions and others.  They are waiting.<\/p> <p>  There were moves to establish a process, but the Department has stated that it is unsure about who took the cuts.  Almost every nurse or doctor in those institutions took the cuts in a spirit of helping the country in its darkest hour when the finances had collapsed.  Now they find that they are being told that they cannot have the cuts reinstated.  It will pose a major difficulty to recruitment and retention.  There is a worldwide shortage of health professionals, teachers and so on.  They are getting plenty of offers from a range of countries around the world, some of which are aggressively recruiting them.  If there is a hard crash-out Brexit by the UK, the UK will recruit aggressively for almost all categories of public service staff.  Currently, those are being recruited from the wider European Union.<\/p> <p>  Has the Minister a solution to this unfair situation?  People in vital, publicly funded health and other services are not getting pay restoration.  In a relatively short time, they will have a 3% minus differential compared with other people working in the hospital next door.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#D00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":847,"content":"<p>Before I answer the Deputy's question directly, I will say a brief word about the earlier point that she put to me, as it is important to me.  She raised the question with me previously, but I was not in a position to answer it fully then.  She asked about where we were in terms of diversity in our appointees, particularly through the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  In 2017, the proportion of female appointees through PAS was 52% of all appointments.  Since discussing the matter with the Deputy, I recently spoke at an event at the Institute of Directors in Ireland where I said that this was a pace of change that I wanted to see continue.  From what I see in my Departments, we are making progress on a number of levels - by levels, I mean tiers within Departments - but when we reach certain strata, the degree of progress is not what I want.  I want to ensure that we continue making progress on this year after year.<\/p> <p>  Regarding what we are doing to respond to the new Ireland that is growing up in our primary and secondary schools, the PAS is working with NGOs that represent the range of nationalities to which the Deputy referred.  Within that, we are particularly focused on the country's Polish, Lithuanian, Romanian, Latvian and Brazilian communities.  To promote public service job opportunities across Ireland, we are moving into a space where the PAS will be targeting the awareness of jobs in those communities via social media.  We will also ensure that the same work is done to focus on our Traveller, LGBTI and disabilities communities and Irish language groups.  This important piece of work will continue within the PAS.<\/p> <p>  At a practical level, we have redesigned the various websites that our citizens may use to become aware of job opportunities to incorporate new technology to support candidates who have disabilities or use English as a foreign language.  The main reason for doing this is that the citizens who depend on these services are changing in front of our eyes.  As families grow up and kids leave school, we need public services that reflect the make-up of modern Ireland.  The community that the Deputy and I live in reflects how we can do that well.  We are going to keep at it.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question on section 39 organisations directly, we are further advanced in dealing with this matter than we were earlier in the year.  We have put together a process, which has been acknowledged by the representatives of employees in the section 39 organisations, to better understand and penetrate what has happened.<\/p><p>Even from the initial work we have done, it is showing different things happened in different organisations.  I acknowledge that it is the case that wage differentials are developing in some organisations.  We will have to reflect on what that means.  It is not the case for all organisations, however, and different organisations responded in different ways.<\/p><p> We are now on the third round of wage change in the public service.  The previous two rounds of public service wage change happened in a way that did not cause the difficulties the Deputies raised now.  We will need to get a better picture of what has happened in the section 39 organisations in their entirety.  I hope we will make progress in getting to that understanding in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#D00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":849,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his answer on diverse communities.

Obviously, there is a large African population in Ireland, as well as significant populations from different countries in Asia.<\/p><p>The previous Government moved the quota for employing people with a disability in the public service from 4% to 6%.

People are aware that many PPPs are ultimately more expensive than direct State borrowing, particularly when interest rates are low.  We have also moved into a different stage of the economy.  Will the Minister confirm that the cap on investment in PPPs for the national plan has been removed?  If so, why?  What is the Minister's targeted percentage for PPP finance?<\/p><p>I tabled a series of parliamentary questions to all Departments on the amounts committed to PPPs.  I am still waiting for an answer on discount rates and interest rates.  Working out the financial cost of a PPP is extremely difficult.  The two companies which feature largely in PPPs are Capita and Carillion.  The latter is in a state of collapse.  From reading a recent commentary in the <i>Financial Times<\/i>as to how Capita runs its own business, it is far from organised and is run in an appalling way.  In the context of the Carillion collapse and Capita's enormous difficulties, why would the Minister outsource internal audit services in a variety of Departments to Capita?  Why do that when one could use public service recruitment for the Comptroller and Auditor General's office?  The contracts are not large.  Why do particular services such as internal audit need to be outsourced?  I would have thought many people would be willing to work in the public service.  Is it the case that there is now a difficulty with recruiting people into the public service?<\/p><p>There is a slick putting together of the information and maps in the national development plan.  Kilkenny, Carlow and Wexford, however, are not on the main map for national development.  That surprised me and I am sure it surprised the Chairman even more.  Kerry is also not on the main map.  The south east and south west are significant places.  The maps are glitzy and look fantastic.  I welcome that Waterford is included.  Why are the other counties in the south east blacked out, as well as Kerry?  Will the Minister give us a more detailed explanation as to why that is the case?<\/p><p>I was the Minister for Social Protection when the public services card was initiated.  One of the reasons for developing the card was to provide a decent, respectful and humane service to people like pensioners who use public transport.  In recent times, there has been much criticism of the public services card.  However, for pensioners who use public transport, they can get on the bus with an identity card which they can use like a Leap card and with dignity and privacy.  In terms of public service delivery, that is a big gain.<\/p><p>When dealing with many people in retirement or in their 80s or 90s, one has to allow flexibility.  If they have a difficulty with some kind of a request from some unknown bureaucracy, they may find it difficult to respond.  Departments must be quite flexible in acknowledging that, as we do this transition, it is necessary to recognise people's human rights, individuality and where they are at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#E00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":850,"content":"<p>Recruitment from Asian and African communities is already in train.  The answer I gave to the Deputy referred to new groups we are now targeting.  That is new work under way in recent times on top of the work we have regarding Asian and African communities.<\/p> <p>  There is a 3% target in place across all Departments for the employment of citizens with disabilities.  My Department has exceeded that target.<\/p> <p>  I have recommended in the national development plan that the current limit of 10% on the exposure of annual Exchequer allocations for PPPs should be replaced.  I will be publishing further policy on this in the coming months.<\/p><p>I adopt a very careful attitude to the use of PPPs.  I operate on a case-by-case basis.  Any Department proposing to use PPPs to fund infrastructure has to be able to demonstrate to me and the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, that doing so would result in better value than having the Exchequer borrow the money directly.  Therefore, the context in which PPPs are now being used has changed by comparison with a number of years ago.  There are clear criteria that Departments have to meet.  I will be supporting and implementing PPPs only on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p> With regard to what the Deputy said about the outsourcing of audit services, I am not familiar with the specific service referred to but I will obtain more information on it.  I would imagine from having dealt with such matters in the past that an audit service of the kind in question would proceed to public procurement only if it related to an area of specialised auditing that was felt could best be done by an outside company or body, or if we did not have the capacity to do the work.  From my experience of dealing with this across a variety of Departments, I am aware that all Departments, including mine, and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General have very significant audit facilities in place.<\/p><p> I will have to get a copy of the particular map the Deputy is referring to.  Maps I have seen, particularly in respect of transport projects that are identified, refer to both the south east and south west.<\/p><p> With regard to the public services card, I take the Deputy's point.  It is true that the use of the card to help senior citizens to gain access to their free travel entitlements has been a real success.  As I said on a number of occasions, I expect that as the card is rolled out for new services, Departments will exercise the right amount of flexibility in making it work for individual citizens.  Later in the year, we will be announcing a number of assist initiatives to try to help in this regard.  I do not want the rolling out of the card to create a new digital divide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#E00500","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":852,"content":"<p>I have a couple of points.

It is an issue the Minister raised in his opening statement when he said he wanted open, accountable and ethical Government underpinned by a transparent and effective public system.  Everybody in the committee subscribes to that aspiration.  The Minister has direct responsibility for holding up 27 legislative measures that have been passed by the D&aacute;il or both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Some of them were passed by the D&aacute;il with the Government's support.  However, it is clear at this stage that there is now a Government policy not to provide money messages to legislative measures, including measures before this committee.  One measure, for example, is legislation I sponsored.  It was drafted by the Law Reform Commission, which knocks on the head the Taoiseach's argument that these are drafted overnight.  It is legislation the Government supports and which the Minister's predecessor in the junior capacity of that Department asked me not to bring before the committee until the summer of last year because of the Department's workload.  I agreed to do that on the basis that it would proceed.  The legislation is still not allowed to proceed because no money message has been provided.<\/p> <p>  I will outline what this legislation provides for, and this is just one example from 27 legislative measures awaiting money messages.  The Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill provides for an update of our insurance laws.  Those laws were drafted on the basis of court rulings in Britain arising from the 1630s and 1640s in terms of merchant shipping.  The Bill ensures that when one's house is struck by lightning and burns to the ground the insurance company cannot refuse to pay out as a result of it declaring that one's burglar alarm, which had nothing to do with the lightning strike on the house, was faulty or was not the type that was identified in the insurance contract.  The legislation is very sensible.  It is about balancing the scales of justice for the consumer as opposed to the large insurance company.  It also puts an onus on the insurance company to ask for information instead of being able to nullify insurance contracts because the consumer did not know what information should have been given freely and voluntarily without being requested.<\/p> <p>  There are many other measures.  The D&aacute;il has just passed what is known by the public as the jail the bankers Bill.  It will allow bankers to face up to five years in jail if they lie to the Central Bank.  That legislation was drafted by the legal division of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It was written by legal professionals on my instruction and guidance, yet it will not get a money message.  Why is the Minister's Department holding up allowing these Bills to be scrutinised on Committee Stage, which the democratic wish of the D&aacute;il?<\/p> <p>  I wish to make another point.  There would be a logical argument if some of these legislative measures caused a charge on the public purse, but the measures I mentioned do not cause a charge.  They change the law but the Department does not have to create a new budget line to implement them.  They are not about changing tax bands or introducing new motorways or the like.  They are about changing the laws to ensure better rights for consumers.  It is not a draw on the public purse.  It might be a draw on the purse of the insurance companies as perhaps they might not make as much profit.  Will the Minister explain why we are in this position two years later?  There is also a question which the committee has discussed in private session.  Why should this committee continue to facilitate Government legislation when the Minister is refusing to accept any legislation from the Opposition despite those measures being agreed by the D&aacute;il, sometimes unanimously?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#G00500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":872,"content":"<p>That is not an Estimates matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#G00600","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":873,"content":"<p>It is a matter for an effective public system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#G00700","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":874,"content":"<p>It is not an Estimates matter and I am here today to deal with the Estimates, which the Deputy will undoubtedly raise with me.

However, it is not about an individual piece of legislation.  It is relevant to this.   The reason I say it is relevant is because the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in his opening statement, talked about political reform, accountability and ethical Government.  He has introduced this topic.  There is an issue here because the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il yesterday said that unless parties sign up to the capacity review of the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser, OPLA, of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Dunning report, then the money messages will not be forthcoming.  He is taking a blanket approach in relation to this.<\/p> <p>  He is not looking at legislation on a one-to-one basis.  We have two years now of legislation before the committee, and it is not just this committee, because the Minister and his Department make the calls in respect of all of the other items of legislation.

He is the line Minister in the Department which is responsible for deciding if money messages are presented or not in respect of outstanding items of legislation.

I do not expect the Minister to be aware of it but I want him to become aware of it.  It is included in the national development plan and it is a matter of public expenditure.  On page 49 of the national development plan, it is stated, \"The following regional and local roads will be progressed over the course of the National Development Plan ... Carrigaline Western Distributor Road\".  When I was on the county council over a decade ago, we passed the Part 8 planning for that particular project.  In 2010, the project was about to collapse completely.  I intervened directly with the then Minister for Transport, Noel Dempsey, to ensure that funding would be provided to complete the compulsory purchase order, CPO, process.  Mr. Dempsey gave a commitment to provide the funding.  The Department provided 50% of the funding.  The council came up with the rest.  The land has now been secured.  Later this year, the detailed design of that particular project will be completed.  Planning is in place.  The CPO has been completed.  Detailed design will be done later this year.  Carrigaline is a town of approximately 17,000 people.  It is choking with traffic.  There is a residential development under way across the road from where I live.  Three hundred houses with planning permission are being built.  Ultimately, there will be approximately 800 houses.  The T&aacute;naiste lives in the town.  He will be well aware of this issue.  I was glad to see the project included in the national development plan, but I got a parliamentary reply from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, in which he states, \"My Department is, however, liaising with Cork County Council with a view to positioning the project for development in the post 2021 period.\"  It is all very fine for this to be in the national development plan, but the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is saying, \"Come back to me in 2022 or beyond\".  He is saying post-2021.  That is not good enough.  That project is shovel ready.  I do not expect a direct answer from the Minister.  The project is included in the national development plan.

The EU and international division deals with the development and implementation of strategies at European Union and euro area level, and internationally on economic, fiscal and financial policy formulation and the cross-departmental co-ordination of EU policy.  It manages the EU budgetary process and EU economic governance.  It also builds relationships through Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network and ensures that both I and the Department are fully apprised of EU and international developments. <\/p> <p>  A dedicated Brexit unit within the EU and international division was established in July 2016 to manage Brexit work across the Department.  This includes co-ordination of the Department&rsquo;s contribution to the overall Government response to Brexit, including input to the EU-level negotiation process and domestic preparations to ensure that our country and economy is Brexit ready, and liaison with the Central Bank of Ireland, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and other agencies as appropriate.<\/p> <p>  Several proposals for the deepening of economic and monetary union, EMU, will be discussed at the European meetings in 2018.  These relate to delivery of banking union and capital markets union, convergence in a more integrated economic and fiscal union and promotion of structural reform. <\/p> <p>  The EU and international division also manages our relationship with the International Monetary Fund, IMF, the European Central Bank, ECB, and the European Commission in the context for our former programme of financial support.  The division has responsibility for the management of membership of, and policy development relating to, the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  The European Commission is due to bring forward its proposals on the post-2020 multi-annual financial framework in May.  This will be a key challenge and priority for the Department.<\/p> <p>  During 2017 the funds, insurance, markets and pensions division made a positive contribution towards Council agreement on a range of dossiers, including the anti-money laundering directive and European market infrastructure.  The revised prospectus regulation and the fifth anti-money laundering directive were concluded in 2017.<\/p> <p>  In the area of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, CFT, we had a favourable assessment in the Financial Action Task Force, FATF, mutual evaluation in 2016-2017.  The report, published in September 2017, acknowledges the strength of our CFT systems, but includes a series of recommendations.<\/p> <p>  The first report of the cost of insurance working group was published in January 2017.  Work commenced on the cost of employer and public liability insurance, culminating on the publication of the report in January 2018.<\/p> <p>  The international financial institutions division manages Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with a number of international financial institutions.  These include the IMF, the World Bank Group, the European Investment Bank, EIB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Development Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank.  Our membership of these institutions provides Ireland with a voice at important fora on global economic and international development issues.  Most recently Ireland became a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.  The year 2017 also represented the largest ever annual financing by the European Investment Bank in Ireland.  More than &euro;1 billion of new financing was signed last year with new investments around the country. <\/p> <p>  The banking division is responsible for contributing to the development of a financial services system capable of supporting economic growth and job creation.  This involves policy areas such as the provision of credit, SME financing, consumer protection and addressing mortgage arrears.  That division focuses on supporting the needs of the SME sector.  Along with officials from that division, I have appeared before the committee to discuss matters such as the tracker mortgages.  Decisions I have made recently in that and other areas include doubling the level of compensation that the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman may award to a consumer who has been adversely affected by the action of a financial services provider.  I am now taking steps to appoint two new members to the Central Bank commission with a particular focus on consumer protection.  That process is under way.<\/p> <p>  The shareholding and financial advisory division is responsible for the management of the State&rsquo;s investments in the banking sector.  It responsible for the management of our shareholding in the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and represents my interests regarding the oversight of the agency.  A key highlight here was the successful IPO of AIB.  That unit also works on many issues relating to credit unions <\/p> <p>  The tax division manages taxation and budgetary policy.  It is responsible for analysing, drafting and preparing legislation, including the Finance Bill and the completion of the annual budget process.  As I noted in my budget speech, a key part of its work programme in the coming year will be initiating a process to consider options for the amalgamation of USC and PRSI.  I aim to have this work complete by the end of June.  I recently announced a review of the local property tax, on which the committee has been briefed.  The Finance Act 2017 provides for an exploration of other issues, such as the potential application of a tax on vacant residential property.  I consider that the objective to be met by such a tax would be to increase the supply of homes.<\/p> <p>  The economic division is responsible for developing a strategy for the Irish economy across all sectors and the economic analysis of departmental policies.<\/p> <p>  The funding allocation sought for the finance group of Votes for 2018 totals &euro;407 million, which compares with a 2017 Vote group total of &euro;389 million.  This is an increase of &euro;17.9 million or 5%.  The primary driver of this increase is the provision of a &euro;15.7 million increase for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  I will touch on that in a moment.<\/p> <p>  The gross allocation sought for the Department of Finance Vote in 2018 is &euro;42 million, of which &euro;10 million is provided for a fuel grant scheme for disabled drivers, a further &euro;950,000 is provided to fund the office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  Leaving these aside, my Department&rsquo;s allocation provides for the administrative and non-administrative costs of the Department.  The vast majority of this, some 61%, is provided to cover salaries and allowances, with a further &euro;5.3 million to cover facilities and non-pay costs.  The remaining &euro;6.9 million is provided to cover the legal, advisory and committee costs necessary to support my Department.<\/p> <p>  The allocation for Vote 8, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, is applied towards a single audit and reporting programme.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is independent of my Department and is a constitutional officer.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is responsible for controlling the release of funds for public services as approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, auditing public accounts, undertaking independent examinations and reporting the results of the work to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. <\/p> <p>  The financial audit role covers 290 sets of accounts produced by public bodies.  These bodies have financial transactions that total over &euro;200 billion.  The allocation for this Vote is &euro;7.927 million, which is an increase of 15%.<\/p> <p>  On Vote 9, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners has requested a budget allocation of &euro;357 million.  Three quarters of Revenue's budget relates to payroll.  Revenue plays a vital role in our economy by collecting taxes and duties due to the State.  These receipts underpin Government&rsquo;s capacity to fund vital services and facilities.  In 2017, Revenue collected a record &euro;50.7 billion.  It continued to support taxpayers in meeting their tax and duty obligations.  For example, 2.2 million payments were made through online Revenue services.  A key priority for Revenue is PAYE modernisation, on which work is well advanced.  The 2018 Estimates provide for an additional &euro;3 million in capital and current funding for IT developments required for the administration and smooth transition to PAYE modernisation.<\/p> <p>  Non-compliance with tax and duty obligations is an ever-present challenge.  In 2017, the Revenue yielded &euro;575 million though its audit and compliance interventions.  There were 24 criminal convictions, an increase of six on the previous year.  I have allocated an additional &euro;4 million in the 2018 Estimates for an additional 100 compliance staff.<\/p><p>Tackling tax evasion is always high on Revenue&rsquo;s agenda.  In 2017, 2,786 disclosures with a declared value of &euro;84 million.  Revenue has initiated a new inquiry to identify and pursue taxpayers engaged in offshore tax evasion and avoidance.<\/p><p> In other areas, Revenue continues to assist the Department of Finance in the formulation and implementation of tax policy.  It will support my Department in the review of the Coffey report.  In the context of Brexit, Revenue has been participating in the interdepartmental work co-ordinated by the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade. <\/p><p> On Vote 10, the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC, has a budget of &euro;1.626 million in 2018, a 1% increase on the previous year.  The significant increase in the 2018 Estimate is to provide for the TAC with the resources needed to advance its programme of modernisation and reform and to address its caseload in an efficient and effective manner, while also meeting its obligations and accountability as an independent Civil Service body.  Specifically, during 2018, as a result of the Revised Estimate, the commission hopes to recruit more staff, including tax-qualified case managers.   It will also move office during 2018 to premises which are fit for purpose, largely to allow for multiple hearings and meetings with appellants to take place in parallel.  Further expenditure by the TAC is in the area of ICT as it addresses the significant level of appeal cases.<\/p><p> I thank members for their attention and I commend the Estimates to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#O00600","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I only have a few minutes because I have to go to the D&aacute;il.  I would like to focus on the comments he made on the issue of mortgage arrears and the potential sale of 14,000 family homes and 4,000 rental accommodation units to a vulture fund by Permanent TSB.  When did the bank inform him of its decision in that regard?  Did the bank consult him on the decision?  Bank representatives have informed the committee that they have entered into confidentiality clauses with potential buyers.  Where stands the process?  Did they consult the Minister?  Does he accept that regulation is required to allow for administrative sanctions by the Central Bank if the buyer breaches the code of conduct on mortgage arrears or the Consumer Protection Code?  Does he further accept that regulation in itself is not the issue?  The issue is that the loans will be sold to entities that only have a short-term interest and more regulation will not provide additional protection to those borrowers than that which exists.  These vulture funds, which are ruthless, have no intention of renewing agreements that have been made or entering into accommodation such as split mortgages, arrears capitalisation or interest only payments and, therefore, it is likely that there will be mass evictions in some cases and repossessions in others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#P00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":1008,"content":"<p>I have not yet been consulted formally by Permanent TSB representatives regarding their intentions, though as the process moves forward, they are required to formally consult with, and inform, me regarding the magnitude of what is under way and to ask for my views on certain matters.  The regulations we have in place have played an important role in dealing with mortgage arrears and in reducing the number of non-performing loans, NPLs, throughout the economy and within banks.  However, I have indicated that I will examine the 2015 Act with a fresh eye, conscious of the change that is coming up.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the role of vulture funds, as the Deputy will be aware, the process is only in its early stages.  I am limited at the moment in terms of what I can say because of the commercial sensitivity about some of this but I am aware of the human sensitivity in respect of how people will feel if they believe their homes will be affected by this.

What additional protection will the regulation of these funds give to any of the 14,000 homeowners or the 4,000 renters whose loans will be sold to a vulture fund?  We all know that this is not the issue; the issue is selling long-term products to entities that have only a short-term interest.  That is  a serious issue and there is only one solution, which is not to sell these loans to vulture funds.  I do not deny the issue in respect of Permanent TSB's balance sheet, which has to be dealt with, but we cannot throw these families and renters to the wolves.

The number of repossessions that have occurred is low relative to expectations and to the experience in other countries.  I reiterate that I will engage in a fresh examination of the regulations.

I want to do the right thing by all but an exceptional challenge that I face on the other side of the balance sheet is that 28% of the loans in third largest bank in the State, which has deposits of &euro;17 billion and more than 2,000 staff, are impaired.  It is vital in the upcoming period that a way be found to reduce the number of NPLs that bank and other banks have if we want a safe and secure banking system.

The other insurance companies, XL Catlin, Shaw Insurance Agency, Legal and General, Beazley Insurance, Beazley Re, Royal London, Eversure Insurance and others have committed to coming to Ireland from the insurance side but they are never mentioned.  The only company that was mentioned was that Lloyds Bank did not come.  I am satisfied that we are doing well with financial services.  The conversation I had with the Central Bank of Ireland is that there are dozens, not ten or 20, but dozens of companies that are in a conversation with it.

The largest announcements I have been to include ones at YapStone in Drogheda, Pramerica in Letterkenny, Northern Trust in Limerick and MetLife in Galway.  The one of that scale in Dublin was Fidelity.  We are focusing on the regions.  Some 30% of the jobs in financial services are now outside of County Dublin and we are establishing really strong hubs around the country.  I use Letterkenny as the best example, with interaction between two very large companies, Pramerica and Optimus, and Letterkenny Institute of Technology.  Many people would not have believed that the skill sets and abilities were available in a small to medium-sized town.  Letterkenny's population is approximately 20,000.  The skill sets are there.  If there is a deficit, the institute of technology steps in.  It is very fluid and fleet of foot to try to ensure that there is not any failing with regard to skill sets or abilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#P01100","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":1018,"content":"<p>Is there an estimate of the number of jobs that have been confirmed?

As I said, we are pleased with where we are.  It is important for people, which I am glad the Deputy outlined.  It is no longer about the quantum of jobs but the standard and quality of the job.  We should move up the value chain.  An example of that is Kroll Bond Rating Agency, KBRA, which is the first rating agency to decide to base itself in Ireland.  We now have rating agencies coming here too.  We now have the largest exchange-traded funds, ETF, sector in Europe.  The Deputy knows that aviation is quite strong.  We intend to focus on other areas too.  The big area I outlined in the 2018 action plan was sustainable and green finance.

We recently had a vice president of the European Commission, Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis, here and I raised this issue with him.  As the Minister of State knows, Irish borrowers continue to pay well over the European average in interest rates, including both mortgage holders and commercial borrowers.  While we have a Single Market for goods and services, we do not have a Single Market for financial services.  If we had a true Single Market, Irish customers could borrow from German banks, French banks and Italian banks and could avail of much lower interest rates.  The Commissioner indicated that the European Commission is working on the area.  It should be a priority, given that Irish borrowers are paying much more than the eurozone average.  Our Government should take a strong interest in this issue.  We would all welcome more competition in the Irish banking market but it seems unlikely that that will happen.  It is not seen as an attractive market and it is very small.  The best way to help consumers at a European level is to bring about a fully functioning Single Market for financial services.

There is really no reason, in a proper Single Market, Irish consumers should not be able to buy products from these banks.  It is an issue that we should be particularly strong on because of the high rates here.  We should be to the fore in pushing for that Single Market system to come into effect for financial services.  I take the Minister of State's point about potential downsides.  We have had Setanta Insurance and hopefully no more such incidents will occur because of the passporting in and the fact that firms only have to be regulated here for conduct of business purposes.

I expect that, at the June or July European Council and the meeting of finance Ministers across that period, we will make greater progress in putting in place the policy framework needed for the realisation of the banking union, which will ultimately lead to banks being more active outside current jurisdictions.  I will make two points in that context.  A long-term consequence of the banking crisis that we went through is the increased nationalisation of banks.  There has been a trend towards banks being refocused in their home market.  As the Deputy knows, even in an Irish setting, large banks were required in many cases to divest their presence in international markets, as was the case for Irish banks.<\/p><p>The prospects of that happening for Ireland in terms of new forms of established banks coming in are medium-term prospects.

Currently, the Tax Appeals Commission is not fit for purpose.  The Minister provided details to me in a reply to a parliamentary question.  I have it before me on my telephone &ndash; I am on aeroplane mode, Chairman.  More than &euro;1.6 billion in outstanding tax is caught up in the appeals system.  Over 3,600 appeals remain to be resolved.  The issue is that the number is growing and the problem is getting worse.  In 2017, over 1,700 new appeals came in and 252 were resolved or concluded.  The net increase in 2017 alone of 1,500 appeals is staggering.

There are over 1,000 appeals for each commissioner.  Without significant intervention this problem is not going to be resolved.  In fact, it will get far worse.  The Irish Tax Institute has raised significant concerns over this issue with the Minister and the Department.  The appeals system is an important part of our tax code and system, as the Minister is aware.  It is now open to abuse.  If a person wishes to kick an issue into the never-never, the best way to do it is to appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is giving a 1% increase in the budget in Vote 10 for 2018.  The Minister described this in his opening statement as a significant increase.  It is 1%.  That is not terribly significant, to say the least.

In 2016, the figure went to &euro;0.844 million.  The provisional out-turn for last year is &euro;1.07 million and for 2018 it will go to &euro;1.6 million.

This morning, media reports indicate that banking analysts are saying that to do anything with legislation or regulation relating to the sale of Permanent TSB loans would make it less attractive for the vultures.  That gives us a sense of the type of market we are now into.  In commentary this morning, Davy stockbrokers pointed to political opportunism and said that the loans totalling &euro;2 billion were typically owned by people who will not pay and who do not want to pay and so on &ndash; the non-payers.  The firm is saying that typically those involved are homeowners whose mortgages are in arrears and who refuse to engage.  That is what is going on in the media and in the bubble of the bankers.<\/p> <p>  I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that Permanent TSB has 14,000 homes.  AIB is lining up with some type of sale as well.  We know from the exchanges with the other banks at this committee that they too are lining up and that there will be issues for homeowners.  Permanent TSB said in its response to our initial informal approach that the bank would not be in a position to discuss the composition of the loan portfolios, criteria, levels of arrears information etc.<\/p><p>Permanent TSB has confirmed that it and prospective bidders have signed non-disclosure agreements as part of the sales process.  The point is that all of this information is in the public domain anyway, regardless of whether it is misinformation or is correct.  We intend to issue a formal invitation to Permanent TSB to appear before the committee next Tuesday.  We will discuss with the bank the make-up of these loans, the cohort of people who are in difficulties, the length of time they have been in difficulties, what they have done resolve these difficulties and so on.  This will give a greater understanding to the public, the Government and the Opposition of exactly what is going on within Permanent TSB.

In respect of the other banks and what is generally happening with the sale of SME loans, some of which involve good businesses attached to bad loans and so on, it is reported that agricultural land is now being examined by the banks relative to the loans they have issued to the farming community.  In the context of reviewing the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015, will the Minister consider insisting that the banks at least hold off on their sales until such time as the legislation is actually reviewed?  When he is reviewing that legislation, particularly in respect of homeowners, will the Minister consider expanding the mortgage-to-rent scheme?  Will he consider reconfiguring Abhaile in order that its remit is extended to mortgage resolution?  Will he consider the credit union movement and the funds it has in this respect?  Will he insist on the banks working through each and every loan they have so that we know that at the end of the process, should they have to go to a general sale, every single customer has had the opportunity to engage with the bank on the full suite of resolution mechanisms that are currently available?  When I asked one of the banks at this committee if it engaged with customers on the basis of debt for equity, for example, it said no, it did not suit it to do so.  They have not been engaged with customers.<\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il that the regulation currently in place will extend to the vulture funds.

I can only say that it is 100 times worse for those who are engaged with vulture funds.  I represent customers when they go to these funds.  One customer, as is typical of quite a lot of cases, has tried to engage since last year and the fund has not responded to any of his information requests.  It has not offered any engagement or resolution.  Any offers that have been made in other cases come back with the same answer, that it is not good enough and it wants more money.

Going back to a comment I made earlier, I am very conscious of the worry that is encompassed in that figure of non-performing loans.  However, we need a stable, secure and successful Permanent TSB in Ireland.  On the one hand, we have a direction that has been issued from an independent central bank that is regulating this bank and whose regulation the bank is required to meet.  There is a level of bad loans that is five times the eurozone average, despite the progress the bank has made.

I keep it under review with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to see if any changes are needed to make the scheme even more successful.  The last review of the scheme took place in February 2017, which was not too long ago.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked about the credit union movement.  It is open to any organisation to decide if it wants to acquire any of these loans, if it feels doing so would benefit its balance sheet and fit in with its business model.

I will do it against the background of saying the current legal framework in place and the institutions which have been in place to manage this very difficult issue for many years within the country have played an important role.  I cannot comment on any individual and it would not be appropriate for me to do so.  Of course, we are all aware of citizens who have reached resolutions with their banks and agreements which have led to a significant decrease in mortgage arrears on non-performing loans.  I have many colleagues, including Deputies Peter Burke and Bernard J. Durkan, who have been raising the matter with me and will look at further change if it is needed and how and when I can do it.  Of course, I want to do it as soon as I can, but I do not want to lose sight of the fact that the framework we have had in place has enabled a resolution for many citizens of banking difficulties which, a number of years ago, had looked nearly insurmountable.

It appears from that circumstance that the scales are tilted in favour of the institutions and the vulture funds in this case.

The employer liability and public liability reports were done, they went to Cabinet and they have been published.  A lot of work has been done, some of it following the recommendations of the motor insurance report of 12 months earlier.  The Personal Injuries Commission has been established and Mr. Justice Kearns has produced its first report.  He is working on a second part, which will be very telling as it will cross-reference payments in the Irish system with those in our nearest neighbour, and maybe some other jurisdictions.  It will compare what people get from similar claims in the UK to what they get in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  One line sticks out from the employer liability and public liability reports, which asserts that one cannot have low premia and high awards.

There are a number of aspects to this.  The general data protection regulation is to start in May.  A recommendation on employers' land public liability insurance will be that, if somebody has a claim, that he or she must present it within 28 days, the period for which somebody can hold information.  If there is a video camera recording an event or potential accident, somebody has to present the claim to the individual within the period, otherwise the data have to be deleted.

I am joined by my two colleagues Mr. Eamonn Waters, who is principal officer in water policy and the rural water programme and Mr. Martin Vaughan, assistant principal.<\/p> <p>  The issue that is the focus of discussion today was previously raised at the committee&rsquo;s meeting with the Minister on 15 November 2017 which considered the Department&rsquo;s Estimates and there have been developments since then.  I will provide the committee with an update on where matters currently stand and some contextual information.  <\/p> <p>  The context for this discussion is the major reform of water services initiated in 2012, which saw the transfer of statutory responsibility for public water services to Irish Water.  The current delivery model is based on Irish Water working with local authorities through 12-year service level agreements, SLAs, which were effective from 1 January 2014.  This collaborative approach was enabled by the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, which also sets out the statutory protections for the terms, conditions and pensions of workers should these agreements come to an end.<\/p> <p>  Working with the local authorities through these SLAs, Irish Water has made significant progress in establishing the utility&rsquo;s capability, which has included investing over &euro;2 billion in the system to date.  The Minister has gone on record many times to acknowledge the role played by local authorities and their staff in the provision of water services over this period, a period which has been at times very challenging.  The ongoing commitment of water services staff to ensuring continuity of service and service improvement remains the hallmark of water services in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Over this time, some key components of the operating environment for Irish Water have changed from that envisaged in the water sector reform implementation strategy published in December 2012.  Irish Water is now reflected on the Government&rsquo;s balance sheet and the funding model has changed.  These changes flow from the report of the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services and the enactment of the Water Services Act 2017.  Irish Water is now funded largely through the Vote of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Irish Water&rsquo;s commercial debt will be replaced with State debt over time.  This places new demands on Irish Water in terms of accountability, governance and delivering value for money for taxpayers.  However, the central commitment to a single regulated water services utility in public ownership remains at the heart of the reform programme, a position which has been confirmed by the confidence and supply arrangement in support of the minority Government.  Within this new funding environment, it is considered critical that Irish Water, which now has full statutory responsibility for the delivery of water services, is appropriately equipped to carry out its statutory functions as efficiently and effectively as possible.  It was a central understanding of the report of the committee, which was approved by the Oireachtas, that the change in funding structure should not impede in any way the delivery of the requisite level of investment and operational projects in line with the Irish Water business plan. <\/p> <p>  The current business plan is the Irish Water business plan to 2021, which was published in 2015.  This plan was considered by Government and was approved subject to budgetary and regulatory review.  The plan sets out the priorities of the utility to 2021 and underpins the transformation plan for the water sector.  During the course of 2017, Ervia examined the options to meet its regulatory and business plan targets and concluded that the public water system would benefit from greater integration of operations into a single utility.  Following this consideration, the Department was informed that the Ervia board had decided in principle not to renew the SLAs beyond 2025 when they are due to end and to work with local authorities and unions to move to the integrated model within the life of the current plan.<\/p><p>The Government has noted this position.<\/p><p> Subsequently, the Minister met with the key stakeholders in the delivery of water and wastewater services, namely the County and City Management Association, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and relevant unions, and of course Ervia and Irish Water.  Following these discussions, the Minister has written to the parties, and asked them to engage with the proposals in an open and constructive manner.  He has asked the parties to examine the issues in developing the appropriate national framework for the Irish Water transformation programme.<\/p><p> These letters have been provided to the committee for information and I will highlight a couple of key elements.  First, the need for a significant programme of transformation is highlighted, as is the positive experience of other utilities such as Scottish Water from the implementation of a single way of working, both in terms of efficiency gains and opportunities for staff; second, assurance is provided that the current service level agreements, SLAs, remain in place until such time as an alternative is agreed; third, assurance is provided that no compulsory redundancies would arise as an outcome from the transformation process; and fourth, there is a recognition that the process of transformation needs to be cognisant of the potential impacts on the wider local government system to ensure that stranded costs do not arise for local authorities which would impact on other services.<\/p><p> In his recent correspondence with key stakeholders, the Minister also advised that he is open to considering other governance, accountability and structural changes which improve the delivery of public water services by Irish Water.  Furthermore, the Water Services Act 2017 provides for the establishment of a new statutory Water Advisory Body, WAB, which will make recommendations to improve the transparency and public accountability of Irish Water and also report to the committee and the Oireachtas on the implementation of the Irish Water business plan. The process for the establishment of the WAB is now in train.<\/p><p> Arrangements for the process of dialogue on the transformation programme are currently being put in place and the Minister has asked the parties to provide him with an update on progress by Easter.  Therefore, members will appreciate that, in addressing the committee, I do not want to prejudge what might be said in these discussions, or to predetermine the outcome on particular aspects.<\/p><p> The Department looks forward to open and constructive engagement between the trade unions, local authorities and Ervia-Irish Water and is of the view that these parties are best placed in the first instance to examine relevant issues in developing the appropriate national framework for the next stage in the Water Services transformation programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#D01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519291800,"counter":1092,"content":"<p>My name is Mike Quinn and I am the group chief executive officer of Ervia, the parent company of two regulated companies, Irish Water and Gas Networks Ireland.  I am joined by Mr. Jerry Grant, the managing director of Irish Water and Mr. John Dempsey, who has responsibility in Irish Water for managing the continued transformation of Irish Water towards the single public utility.  I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to outline our position on Irish Water&rsquo;s proposed move to a single utility by 2021 and in particular, the future delivery of water and water sanitation services.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, I want to record the very considerable progress in the transformation of public water services since 2014 by Irish Water, working under service level agreements, SLAs, with the 31 local authorities.  This has seen a seamless transfer of responsibility for public water services to Irish Water and delivered a major increase in investment, while also achieving over &euro;100 million in annual operational efficiency and significant improvement in key service areas, for example in drinking water safety and in saving 89 million litres of water daily.  This progress could not have been made without the dedication and commitment of the staff across Irish Water and each of the local authorities. <\/p> <p>  The challenges facing Irish Water include bringing public water and wastewater services to acceptable international benchmark standards, achieving compliance with legal obligations, meeting social and economic needs while addressing effectively the critical assets at risk of failure. Meeting these challenges requires an organisation that is truly fit for purpose, with the water services workforce, processes and systems within a single organisation structure. <\/p> <p>  The Irish Water Business Plan 2014-2021 sets an ambitious but achievable programme of objectives and targets which, if delivered, will provide this country with a radically improved service by 2021.  For example, our drinking water will be safe for all consumers, we will have addressed the most critical wastewater issues causing pollution today and exposing Ireland to serious risk of large scale fines, we will have cut leakage by 10% nationally and at the same time we will have achieved annual operational savings of &euro;250 million compared to the starting point in 2014. <\/p> <p>  The Ervia Board, its executive and the management in Irish Water have been addressing the challenge of meeting these commitments and have concluded that it requires that we now move forward with the next stage of transformation, to deliver a single national utility for water services delivery for Ireland within the lifetime of the business plan.  We welcome the opportunity to outline why we have reached this conclusion. <\/p> <p>  Before doing so, I want to emphasise that this proposal has only recently been outlined to the key stakeholders, in particular the local authority managements and the staff unions.  We fully recognise that extensive engagement will be needed to address all of the concerns that will arise for staff and for the future of the local government service. <\/p> <p>  Since 2014, Irish Water is making strategic investment decisions in water infrastructure on a national basis, planning for the long-term future of water services, responding to operational incidents across county borders and working to deliver a single streamlined service to all customers across the country.  Through our investment and operational programmes, we have resolved the critical boil water notice issues inherited in 2014, made significant progress in reducing risk to drinking water and started to make inroads on the wastewater treatment deficit facing the country. <\/p> <p>  However, with an estimated overall infrastructure deficit in excess of &euro;13 billion, it will take several investment cycles to bring all of the assets to the required level.  In the meantime, we must make the best use of available resources through an asset management driven approach which optimises investment, operations, maintenance and asset utilisation to deliver the best outcomes for the resources available.  Ultimately, our ambition is that every citizen and company connected to our networks should enjoy the same satisfactory level of service irrespective of where they are located. <\/p> <p>  With four years experience of operating under the SLAs, and recognising the progress made, we can now clearly see the limitations of this structure.  I will give some examples.  We are faced with multiple and varied ways of working which militate against consistent safe operation of the services, leading to avoidable service failures; we have plants operating within capacity which fail to meet service targets due to sub-optimal operation.  In addition, we spend over &euro;100 million annually on external private plants through the design build operate, DBO, operational contracts.  Taken together, these factors reflect the lack of a single unified, consistent and coherent operational service capability.  We cannot deliver the capability levels required in process optimisation, specialised maintenance, leakage control and incident response at county level.  We suffer inconsistent customer service outcomes due to the different work practices and the lack of consistent reporting on service responses.  We incur substantial costs in fragmented management and workforce structures across 32 organisations which can result in delays and operational complexity, with no clear accountability.  Finally, we need to deliver a whole range of specialist services at appropriate scale, requiring central and regional structures and best use of expert resources.  <\/p> <p>  Implementing the single public utility, where all water services staff would work directly for the national utility and deliver a joined-up single service, is the optimum way to manage our water and wastewater services.  It is key to ensure future public confidence in our water and wastewater services.  It offers the opportunity for a specialist water industry, with better supported career structures and increased investment in staff training and skills, development of true centres of excellence and the introduction of apprenticeship models to support first class service delivery. <\/p> <p>  Despite the significant progress achieved to date, the Ervia executive and its board along with Irish Water management recognised that without completing the full transformation to a single national utility organisation, it would not be possible to deliver all of the business plan objectives by 2021.  The choice of the single public utility operational model was based on an analysis of the experience to date, as well as the achievements of other water utilities, notably the public utility companies Scottish Water and Northern Ireland Water, which undertook very similar transformations. <\/p> <p>  From 2018, the majority of the cost savings and improved service performance can only be achieved through more effective asset operations by moving to regional working, implementing a single system of work, standard operating procedures, process optimisation and integrated maintenance delivery.  The single public utility, once fully implemented, will free up &euro;70 million per annum in operational savings and efficiencies, an essential part of funding our capital investment plan and through standardising operations and processes, deliver major performance benefits; allow Irish Water realise the full benefits of the investment being made in technologies such as supervisory control and data acquisition, SCADA, and telemetry; and, provide our shareholder and our regulators the single accountability for meeting our business plan commitments and in supporting public policy generally.  <\/p> <p>  We have written to the Minister to inform him of the Ervia board&rsquo;s intention not to renew the SLA post 2025; move to the full single public utility operations model, an integrated operations model within which Irish Water would have control of both the human resources and assets needed to efficiently and effectively deliver water services; and, work with local authorities and unions to manage this change within the period of the current business plan.<\/p> <p>  One single public utility, made up of both Irish Water and local authority staff working together in one fully integrated organisation, focused on first class service delivery to customers, is the optimum way forward.<\/p><p>Implementing a single utility approach to water service delivery is similar to how normal utilities such as the ESB or other water utilities have evolved and now work.  The single public utility was selected as the optimum model as it will allow us to: deliver one national vision for water continuing to provide service continuity and knowledge through locally delivered work; create one connected community of water services staff; offer water industry employees more structured career paths, professional development and training opportunities; enable local workforces to deliver a consistent and standardised customer service to all consumers; allow increased preventive work to be undertaken reducing costly workarounds and reactive work; remove constraints on service and investment presented by traditional geographic boundary lines; implement a more streamlined management structure thereby bringing decision making closer to the front line; and generate incremental operational efficiencies of <i>circa<\/i>&euro;70 million plus per annum.  Achieving these efficiencies is critical to the funding of our capital investment plan.<br\/><br\/>With our proposal, local authority water services employees will continue to work in the sector and become Irish Water employees.  It is important to note that their terms and conditions are protected under relevant water legislation and we are committed to honouring these conditions.  While we recognise the concerns that many existing staff will have, we look forward to engaging with them on the benefits of working in a dedicated water utility which is committed to further investment in safety, equipment and developing dedicated career paths.  This utility will be fully accountable through the structures and governance being established, for example, the water advisory body.<br\/><br\/>Working as the single public utility, we want a continuing, collaborative relationship with local authorities.  We propose supporting this via a dedicated Irish Water local authority liaison office network.  The liaison office for each local authority would act as the key relationship function for the local authority chief executive, councillors and Oireachtas Members dealing with the key strategic issues for the local authority in question, for example, economic and social development while also managing issue escalations between the local authority and Irish Water.  It would ensure ongoing cooperation on areas of common interest such as storm water management, fire-flows, emergency response and environmental protection.<br\/><br\/>Implementing the single public utility will be complex and challenging and will take time.  However, we have a commitment to improve how we deliver water and wastewater services and provide a first-class water utility.  Our vision by 2021 is for a unified water services industry working collectively to deliver excellent customer service and safeguarding and conserving our water, our environment and our public health.  This is now the right time to start taking the next step in the transformation of water services delivery.  By delivering this transformation in full and by 2021, Irish Water will ensure that Ireland achieves the best possible water and wastewater services for future generations.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":1094,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives from Irish Water.  I want to put on the record my appreciation of the excellent support provided to my constituents and I by Irish Water's hotline any time I ring it.  I acknowledge the support of the chief operating officer's office in terms of the issues that arose locally.  They could not have been more proactive in attempting to solve them.  I also thank Mr. Grant, his team and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for their good will and professionalism at all times.<\/p> <p>  Six months ago, I requested that we would bring Irish Water before the committee with regard to the huge crisis in the water supply in Drogheda last year.  I regret that it has taken until now for Irish Water to come here and that the matter is not on the agenda today.  This is wrong because there are serious lessons that must learned locally and nationally from that crisis.  I regret that I do not have an opportunity to hear Irish Water's comments on that today.  I listened to other members, particularly Deputy Casey who suggested that we should have a full day on it if necessary.  I do not have a problem with that but leading it must be the national response of Irish Water to critical shortages, as occurred in Drogheda, and the disgraceful response for a few days - albeit over a weekend - where there was nobody in charge, nobody was accountable, the water supply was stopping and there were no tankers, no organisation and no plan.  There was sweet damn all in place.  I had to ring the Minister to express my concerns and in fairness to him, after that call, there was a response after two or three days and the situation improved as time went on.  However, there is a serious failure in Irish Water with regard to planning for emergencies like that.  I appreciate that I may not get the answer today given the way this was organised and I am not blaming anybody.  I asked for it to be here and it is not.  That is my point and I am not happy with that.  I will not have it today but it is an urgent issue that we should discuss here.  I want the lessons to be learned and iterated around the country so that it never happens again.  <\/p> <p>  The second issue I want to address is the lack of transparency in Irish Water.  In her opening statement, Ms Graham talked about the change in the Irish water sector and said \"this places new demands on Irish Water in terms of accountability, governance and delivering value for money for taxpayers.\"  The one word that was missing, and I am not implying it was intentional, is \"transparency\".  I am failing to get transparency from Irish Water.  It is subject to freedom of information, FOI, legislation and has one FOI request from me that is now being appealed to the Office of the Information Commissioner.  What I am seeking are the minutes of Irish Water's management meetings in a transparent, open and accountable way.  I do not believe Irish Water is actually hiding anything.  It just does not want me to know what it is up to.  What is going on?  Why is there opposition with Irish Water to the release of minutes of meetings of management so that we can understand what the issues around the country are?  It is appalling and disgraceful.  I paid &euro;25 for an internal review and I am now paying &euro;50 to go to the Office of the Information Commissioner.  I think that is wrong.  There should be and must be accountability from Irish Water but there is none.  As somebody who brought in the legislation relating to Irish Water, I find it unacceptable that Irish Water is not accountable and hides from people like me who are trying to get transparency.  <\/p> <p>  Another issue that is fundamental and is no surprise to anybody sitting here from the Department or Irish Water is the fact that I am concerned at the presence of Ervia at this meeting.  If we want a single utility, an idea I fully support, it should be a stand-alone company - Irish Water - that has nothing to do with Ervia.  Ervia has many other tasks and situations with which it must deal in other companies.  It is wrong to talk about a single utility that is at the same time, controlled by another organisation.  When will Ervia be separated from Irish Water?  When will Irish Water become a stand-alone company because it lacks transparency, accountability, management structure and clarity so that everything that happens is straight and clear?  Regarding the biggest reason things went wrong with Irish Water, when we set it up, and people here know this, we were told that the total set-up cost of consultants would be less than &euro;20 million.  That is the truth.  What happened?  The cost was over &euro;200 million.  The company went crazy with consultants; spent money left, right and centre; left people like me who set up the company and who fully support what is being said here today about a single utility with egg on our faces; and created trouble up and down the country.  People lost their seats over this.  We acted in good faith but we were told untruths.  What happened was just appalling.  I appreciate that I am taking up time but I must put this on the record.  <\/p> <p>  The former chief executive officer of Irish Water has gone, as has the former chief executive of Ervia.  Is there transparency regarding their settlement figures and whatever they received when they left the companies?  Reference was made to design, build and operates, DBOs, of &euro;100 million.  One of the good opportunities I had as Minister of State was to visit a DBO.  I am not sure whether some people at this meeting were there at that meeting outside Limerick.  It was sold to me as a very efficient and effective means of supplying water for the city of Limerick.  What is Irish Water proposing to do with that because I was told it was very efficient and very well-managed, could not be bettered in terms of its engineering and capacity and Irish Water was very happy with it?  Is Irish Water going to kick all these people out and put more bureaucrats in place?<\/p><p> Let me return to the key point, which I acknowledge others want to make.  Ervia, formerly Bord G&aacute;is, supplies services to Irish Water.  What is the cost of those services?  Is there competition for them?  Where is the transparency in this regard?  I would like to see it.  I presume I will be allowed to contribute after the responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#F00200","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":1096,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Dowd.

I do not have the precise number.  We make presentations at Oireachtas meetings and there is a lot of scrutiny.  With regard to the specific example, it is not reasonable that we would publish the proceedings of the ordinary, day-to-day management meetings of the business.  We will absolutely respond, however, to any request for information on a particular issue raised.  If this includes the elements of minutes of meetings that relate to it, of course they will be provided without question.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the initial investment, we have reported in detail to Oireachtas committees previously.  Some &euro;173 million was invested to establish Irish Water.  Those systems now underpin the utility operation.  We will leverage those systems for what I hope will now be the major expansion of our organisation to accommodate all the operations.  There will, of course, be additional investments.  A business requires continual investments.  We keep our IT systems up to date.  If we take on 3,500 staff, we will have to extend IT coverage and the facilities for them.  The extension will be leveraged off the initial investment, however.  Last year, the operating cost was &euro;116 million lower than the baseline cost in 2014 so the investment has long since been recovered.  It does underpin what we are doing.<\/p> <p>  On the reference to DBOs, in the fragmented structure that existed prior to the establishment of Irish Water, there was no option but for large, sophisticated, complex plants to have DBO contracts.  It was the only way in which the technology could be provided and operated effectively.  What we are saying in our submission, and what I am saying, is that our objective is to build the capability to be able to operate the plants in the ordinary way, in so far as possible, using insourced resources.  If we have the required centres of excellence and the process technologists, there is no reason the plants should not be run on a day-to-day basis by the utility itself and its own staff, with the right expertise.  That, however, requires an organisation that is fully accountable, in addition to staff who are fully accountable and fully supported by the technology and expertise needed to run the plants.  We are not going to terminate them overnight but we are saying this is not a model that one can continue to roll out cost-effectively to deliver the considerable upgrades that are needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#G01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519291800,"counter":1110,"content":"<p>I will address two of the questions.  The Deputy said I did not mention transparency.  In that context, I was highlighting particular issues that had arisen and that were reflected back to the parties following the Minister's conversations with them.  The water advisory body I mentioned, specifically set up under the 2017 legislation, has a specific role, flowing from the confidence and supply agreement, to consider measures needed to improve the transparency and accountability of Irish Water and to advise the Minister accordingly.  That is reflected in section 44 of the Water Services Act.  Transparency, accountability and good governance are part and parcel of Irish Water.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the stand alone utility, as raised by the Deputy, the Government decided in 2012 to ask what was then Bord G&aacute;is, now Ervia, to establish Irish Water as a company within its group structure.  This has been reflected in water services legislation.  This approach was based on the advantages of leveraging the utility experience of the group with the experiences and capability of local authorities in order to build the new organisation.<\/p> <p>  Securing the benefits, efficiencies and synergies from that common utility approach to water and gas business remains an important dimension of Ervia's functions.  Irish Water produces separate accounts.  It is separately regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  The documentation that goes to the regulator very clearly outlines our group services costs and shared costs.  These are commented on and considered by the regulator.  Therefore, there is transparency regarding the services that the group and shared services give to Ervia.  At the same time, there has been an understanding from the outset of the establishment that flexibility would need to be maintained should the Government decide at a future date that Irish Water should be a stand-alone public utility.  That is reflected in the shareholder expectation letter to Ervia and influences matters that I have mentioned, such as the corporate structure, accountability and financial reporting.  Any decision to separate the two would be based on an assessment of what was is the best strategic interest in respect of water and gas.  The Government has not considered separation to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#G01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":1111,"content":"<p>I will let Deputy O'Dowd back in for one minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#G01700","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":1112,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

I have major concerns and I agree with the Deputy O'Dowd.  There is a feeling that Irish Water is stand-alone company and that it is not with other bodies.  This is a concern for me.  Originally a 12-year service level agreement, to 2025, was agreed with the local authorities.  Now Irish Water wants to change this.  I am concerned about this.  Taking Carlow as an example, 50 staff there work with Irish Water.  Of these, 30 are outdoor and 20 are in the offices.  My concern is these local jobs would be taken away.  We have local staff who know every pipe and system, but the talk is that Irish Water will group together various areas.  Will there be local offices, as there are in local authorities, so staff can work from them?  There is major concern among the 50 staff in Carlow because they do not know where they are going.  Originally they were told it would be 12 years.  This needs to be looked at because now Irish Water wants to bring it to seven years.  This is unacceptable and I do not accept it.<\/p> <p>  Where will the funding come from?  We are looking at building a new technological university.  Our capacity with regard to sewerage is massive.  Unless we get funding for all of this who will decide which area gets funding?  That will be crucial.<\/p> <p>  Originally Irish Water went with the Scotland and England plan and this has been mentioned several times.  The English plan had to change because there were massive issues in 2012.  I could give the witnesses 20 plans from my local authority because I have every one of them.  Going back to older houses built 50 years ago, 40 of them could be on the same line.  This means if one is blocked it will block 20 more. This is a massive issue.  In 2012, England had to change its entire scheme because of this and the fact there were so many older estates.  I can name five estates in Carlow with 40 houses on one line.  In another estate, 30 houses are on the same line.  We are told Irish Water is not looking at this but it is an issue.  I have contacted Irish Water several times and it has got back to me.  I will not say it has not got back to me because it has.  The biggest issue for Irish Water is that sewerage lines are going through the middle of houses, gardens and backyards because they are old.  Unless a plan is put in place to sort this it will be a major issue.  The money has to be there and it has to be distributed fairly to each local authority.  Every local authority should be left with Irish Water because people know their own area.<\/p> <p>  There are too many contractors.  Recently we had a problem where someone from Irish Water went to a house and said he was there to deal with a problem with pressure.  The lady rang Irish Water who told her it did not know the man and that he did not work for them.  She called the Garda.  With that, Irish Water came back and said he was a contractor but it did not realise he was in the area on that day and that it was sorry.  This is unacceptable.  Irish Water is stating it provides a service that is better than that of the local authority and better value for money.  It is absolutely not.  This old lady rang the Garda because when she rang Irish Water it did not know who the man was.  This is unacceptable.  A service cannot be provided unless the company knows exactly what it is doing.  I have massive concerns.  The only thing I will say is when I ring Irish Water about a problem it comes back fairly quickly and follows up.  I would like answers to these questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#H01100","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519291800,"counter":1124,"content":"<p>The biggest question, and the one I want to address first is why now, and why the 12-year service level agreements are being reviewed as being no longer optimal for the service.  In 2012 and 2013 the focus was on transition and stability.  Local knowledge and all of those benefits were recognised.  I acknowledge again, as Mr. Quinn did in his opening statement, that the service level agreement has provided a seamless transition of service.  It has allowed us to deliver significant benefits nationally in terms of investment and operation, and there is no question about this.  It has allowed us to do all of this without a single day lost to industrial relations.  This is a tribute to the staff, the unions and management of Irish Water and local authorities.  What we are recognising, and what has been set out in our submission, is we have a real challenge to bring our costs into line with the benchmark costs of a similar utility.  If we continue as we are and we sacrifice the &euro;70 million a year saving potential which is there it is &euro;70 million less to invest.  This is a significant part of our overall plan.  At the same time, in terms of standard operating procedures, we have different operating procedures throughout the country.  With regard to how we can respond on customer services, or how we can address national issues such as leakage on a regional basis or the operation of modern wastewater plans, we simply cannot have centres of excellence in every local authority area.  It is not possible or cost effective to do this and there are not enough people to do so.  It is all about equity of service throughout the country.  There has to be accountability to the management of Irish Water, which has full responsibility.  We have absolutely all of the responsibility and we accept all of the responsibility.  This has to be matched with accountability.<\/p> <p>  With regard to local knowledge, in 2013 and 2014 it was important.  Over the past four years we have built information systems that capture this information into geographic information systems and our workflow systems.  We are now in a very strong position in terms of objective data on many other assets.  The trouble with local knowledge is sometimes it is not correct and it cannot be verified.  This is not the basis on which a national utility can be run or on which investment decisions made.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned a number of specific items, including the concerns of staff.  At this point we are at the very outset of this process.  We believe many staff in local authorities would welcome the opportunity to come into the utility because it offers the opportunity for a water services sector and a place where they can develop their career and expand it.  We believe that when we can get out and talk in detail about the benefits of working for the utility, better working conditions, safer working conditions, upskilling and apprenticeship we will have an awful lot to offer that will be very attractive to the committed staff in local authorities to work for us.  However, this is a process that involves serious engagement and we want to engage on it.  Before we get to that point we must go through processes, and we are working through certain principles at the top level to get to that point.<\/p> <p>  Specifically on backyard services, which is the issue the Senator has raised, it is an issue we have been addressing since day one.  Today is no different to when the local authorities were in charge.  Backyard services are private services.  They are private drains and not public sewers.  They present enormous difficulties.  If they were handed over to us tomorrow morning we would need tens of millions of euro and crews of people specifically to deal with them.  In the vast majority of cases these issues can be addressed by the residents themselves by simply clearing blockages.  Of course, there is the question of being responsible about what goes down the sewer.  Since the issue arose in 2014, we have been back to local authorities to ask them please to continue doing what they always did.  I believe we have responded where there is a public health issue or where there are elderly or vulnerable people, and we will always do so.  My ask of local authority operational staff is that they always respond and fix the problem if they can, but it is on the basis we respond in this way recognising that private drains are the responsibility of householders.  I hope we have improved on this point considerably.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the call-out, what the Senator reported was a Joe Duffy conversation and, frankly, he got it completely wrong, as very often happens on Joe Duffy.

As Mr. Grant said, we have focused on the area to ensure that the service is appropriate in terms of what local authorities did.  It might be useful to clarify that.  Senator Murnane O'Connor referred to investment.  A huge amount of investment is going into the area of water services, and will continue in the future.  The national development plan earmarks some &euro;8.5 billion, as Mr. Quinn set out.  That is organised in a strategic national way.  Opportunities are embedded in the water services legislation, when the investment plans are being developed by Irish Water they must engage with local authorities.  As I understand it, the current engagement is around the methodology so those priorities can be identified across all the spheres.  The investment is increasing.  What local authorities are delivering through the service level agreements is the operational staff.  They are paid for payroll, pension costs and overheads.  The investment decisions across the country are now being made by Irish Water but they are not being made in isolation from a process that stands apart from the service level agreement.  That is reflected in the legislation.

I hope that whatever happens, Carlow will get its fair share.  We have massive issues with sewerage.  Irish Water should keep local offices.  It would be detrimental not to.

Has the agenda to privatise water gone away?  The anti-water charge movement succeeded in knocking it back and I think that it has been delayed but that the agenda has not gone away.  It can be seen in recent comments by the Taoiseach, when he indicated his views on Deputy Joan Collins's Bill to keep water in public ownership.  We also see it in the moves towards the single utility.<\/p> <p>  My understanding of the service level agreements with the councils for the council staff is that they were due to run to 2025.  Now I see it is to be brought forward to 2021.  I hear what the representatives of Irish Water are saying, that the staff who are currently there will have their wages, conditions and pensions respected but that does not really answer the question.  The key question is what will be the position for new staff.  Will newly-hired staff have the same wages, conditions and pension rights?  Is Mr. Grant willing to give a commitment to the committee today that the wages, conditions and pension rights of newly-hired staff will be at least equal to what current staff have?<\/p> <p>  We have seen it in other utilities.  It is part of the privatisation agenda when they start to recruit on lower rates.  Then redundancies come on the agenda.  I hear what is being said about there being no compulsory redundancies but we have heard that before.  There are ways of manufacturing redundancies in a company and there is a vested interest in doing so when there is a two-tier workforce of people on lower wages and conditions and those on higher wages and conditions.  Over time, the old staff are disposed of and the new staff mean a lower paid workforce, which is part of making a company ripe for privatisation.  Will Mr. Grant give the commitment that new hires and staff will be on at least the same wages, conditions and pensions as existing staff?<\/p> <p>  Many members of the committee, myself included, believe the excessive use charge being introduced next year is the first step on the road to trying to introduce water charges by the back door.  I want to be clear that if there are attempts to introduce water charges by the back door, they will be resisted, not only by political parties such as my own but more importantly by communities throughout the country.  My question is how on earth will Irish Water introduce these excessive use charges next year when 42% of the country is unmetered and will remain so, since any attempt to meter the communities I represent will stand against it.  They know it is part of an agenda of charging and privatisation down the road.  I am interested to hear his response because I put it to Mr. Grant that Irish Water cannot do it.  <\/p> <p>  There has been controversy recently over the &euro;17 call-out charge which Irish Water intends to introduce next year for households that query bills for excessive use.  According to reports, where someone calls them out and the query is correct there is no charge and where the query is not proven to be correct the charge will rise to &euro;100.  That is blatant discrimination against low-income families, households and communities.  Of course the more affluent people will feel confident about querying a bill.  How can a low-income household feel confident about querying a bill when there is a threat of a &euro;100 penalty over their heads?  It is blatant discrimination and I challenge Mr. Grant to say otherwise.  <\/p> <p>  We have received reports of households and communities faced with issues which were illustrated most recently by our councillor Michael O'Brien who represents the Beaumont-Donaghmede ward in Dublin.  Councillor O'Brien reported there was a terrace of nine houses where there was serious leakage in the wastewater system.  The leakage does not take place in the mains which runs down the middle of the road or on the householder's pipe in the area between the garden wall and the house, but in the area of the offshoot pipe between the wall and the mains that runs down the middle of the road.<\/p> <p>  In the past, the practice was that the local authorities fixed such leaks.  Here, what is happening is that the local authority says it is Irish Water's responsibility and, contrary to Mr. Grant's assertion that Irish Water always responds, it is saying that it is not the responsibility of Irish Water but of the householders who must fix it themselves.  In this case fixing it involves opening the road at a cost of &euro;20,000 to &euro;30,000.  In this case, and others like it that will inevitably arise, in effect Irish Water is saying householders must put themselves to enormous expense or otherwise the wastewater piping system degrades after a period at the risk of a public health hazard.<\/p><p>That is unacceptable.  The old position should apply in the way that local authorities fixed it in the past.  If Irish Water is in charge, it should fix it.  That is what needs to be done in the interests of public health.  I ask Mr. Grant to comment on that case.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#J00700","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":1135,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Barry.

There are practical rational reasons we are pursuing leakage on the customer side, just as we are on the public side.  We follow up similar leaks in houses that do not have meters in the same way.  <\/p> <p>  On the calibration issue, we have invested a huge amount of money, &euro;465 million, to provide almost 900,000 meters across the country.  These are new meters.  Historically, water metering invariably reads low.  We have very little experience on our non-domestic or domestic side of any possibility of reading high.  The position is simple.  If we had to calibrate meters on a continuous basis for householders it would cost a huge amount of money.  We are absolutely confident, in the event of a query, our meters will be accurate or perhaps on the low side because that tends to be where they are.  In order not to expend our limited budget, we have a charge for calibrations requested by customers.  <\/p> <p>  I refer to the specific issue of a problem with a sewer in the public realm, which is in the footpath.  The legal position is exactly as it was pre-Irish Water.  The local authority did not have responsibility for that.  It was a private drain to the point of connection to the sewer.  However, we have given instructions that in the public realm, all such problems will be repaired by Irish Water and our local authority partners.  If that is not happening, I will follow it up because that should be the case.  I agree entirely with Deputy Barry.  It is not reasonable that a private householder should have to dig holes in the public realm to deal with a private drain.  We will deal with it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519291800,"counter":1140,"content":"<p>I reiterate the point I made in my opening statement that a central component of water sector reform is to retain water services in public ownership.

The proposal to bring forward the end of the service level agreement, albeit negotiated, and to move to what Irish Water calls a single utility model has profound implications not just for the workforce but also for the delivery of services.  I have a series of questions, none of which have to do with the industrial relations elements.  That is a matter between Irish Water, the local authorities and the unions and their members.  However, this is not just an issue for them.  It is also an issue for local authorities and the public who access water services.  It is in that context that my concerns are raised.<\/p> <p>  The original service level agreement indicated there could be future service level agreements.  I think \"one of many\" was one of the phrases included at the time.  My first question for Irish Water and the Department was whether, to address some of the issues motivating the proposed change, an alternative service level agreement or a different type of service level agreement was considered.  I refer in particular to addressing issues such as management practices, operational practices and efficiencies etc.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Quinn mentioned the ESB as an example of a freestanding public utility.  It is a public utility that has a very strong public service ethos and strong public support.  It is also a non-commercial semi-State company and very different to the model for Irish Water and its location in Ervia.  Did the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and Irish Water look at transforming the utility from a commercial semi-State entity located in Ervia to a non-commercial semi-State body on the model of the ESB both for the obvious benefits it would have for workers and the utility and to build public confidence?<\/p> <p>  Can the witnesses confirm that at the centre of this proposal is a desire to reduce the total number of full-time equivalent staff currently employed in the delivery of water and sanitation services from 4,300 to approximately 3,300?  Effectively, there would be 1,000 fewer full-time equivalents working directly in water and sanitation services.  In addition to confirming that, can the witnesses also outline what the impact of that would be on the ability of the utility to deliver those services?  I ask in the context of an increased capital investment programme and increased use of local authority staff to deal with a whole range of issues, some of which have already been outlined.  <\/p> <p>  In addition, we have a growing population.  The national development plan and the national planning framework refer to about a million more people in the State over the next 20 years.  At a time when there is going to be more demand for Irish Water's services, how will it cope with having 1,000 fewer full-time equivalents?<\/p><p> Obviously if staff are taken out of the direct delivery of services, there will be more reliance on contractors, particularly in relation to the capital investment end of the services.  As such, they are not savings in some senses.  Is it not the case that Irish Water is simply transferring certain areas of work, which are currently conducted by operational staff employed by the local authorities, to capital investment accounting funded by contractors?  Therefore, is the figure of &euro;70 million really the full account of that saving?  It is really a smaller figure. <\/p><p> Mr. Grant mentioned &euro;70 million in savings to the taxpayer.  There are no compulsory redundancies.  That is very clear in the proposition.  That means that the 1,000 full-time equivalents taken out of the delivery of water services could end up still employed by local authorities.  Therefore there is not a saving of &euro;70 million to the taxpayer.  The true situation is that Irish Water does not have to pay that &euro;70 million and central Government will have to pay it to continue, whether the number of staff concerned is 1,000, 800 or 500.  Has the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government examined this issue?  The Department has to come up with the money for an extra 1,000 staff members in local authorities, including some pretty senior-level managerial staff.  How have officials worked that out?  Those two questions suggest that the net savings to the taxpayer could be much lower than the &euro;70 million.  Is there any detail on that?  <\/p><p> This is a question for the Department.  Local authorities have been stripped of a range of services, domestic waste and bin collection obviously being the most recent.  What would be the impact on local authorities and their functioning if all of the staff of what had traditionally been core services were sucked out of the local authorities and transferred into a single utility?  Has the Department looked at the impact on the overall local government model and the viability of the local authorities as we currently understand them?  Has that been part of the Department's considerations? <\/p><p> We are talking here about the desire to transfer staff and operations from local authorities.  I note that &euro;100 million is in design-build, DB, and design-build-operate, DBO, contracts.  Does it not make sense to try to bring forward the end of those contracts, particularly when they are not on the scale of the Ringsend plant, to try to fully incorporate them into the public utility?  Given that some of those design-build or design-build-operate contracts arguably have some issues around breach or delays of contracts which should raise penalties and potentially terminate the contracts, is that something Irish Water is pursuing?  Perhaps Mr. Grant would give us his personal view on the very large number of DBs and DBOs that are in the system, and whether he thinks that is an efficient use of public money. <\/p><p> I am very concerned about the impact of all of this on service and the members of the community.  There has been a tendency for Government to centralise the delivery of services.  Two examples are the operation of the medical cards through the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, and the transfer of responsibility for grants for third-level education from local authorities to Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI.  We have seen real problems.  In both of those instances we were told that the change would create efficiencies and make the service faster or more effective.  In fact there are still huge problems with the medical card system , despite the fact that it has been in operation for some time.  While SUSI had a large number of problems at the start, not all of those problems have been transferred.  I wish to direct this question at the Department in particular, but it also concerns Irish Water.  How can the witnesses reassure us that the types of efficiencies they are talking about will really deliver better quality service, given the poor track record of the State in other areas? <\/p><p> Lastly, Deputy Barry raised the issue of the constitutional protection of the public water system.  If it is not an unfair question, I am interested in Mr. Grant's personal view as to whether a constitutional protection of the public water system would be reassuring to the people with whom he is negotiating with and to the public.  Could the fears that many of us have around potential privatisation, whether by this Government or a future Government, be allayed?  Does Mr. Grant think that would be a good thing for us to have?<\/p><p> Finally, I will very briefly raise two unrelated questions.  I will not ask supplementary questions on these topics.  Can we have a very quick update from the Department on the European Court of Justice legal action on wastewater treatment plans, and from Irish Water on the work ongoing to upgrade those plants?  The Shannon to Dublin water pipeline consultation was meant to conclude with the publication of the preferred option last summer.  Planning permission was meant to be pursued in September or October.  This has not happened.  Can the witnesses give us a brief update on that?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#K01100","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519291800,"counter":1146,"content":"<p>In overall terms, the Irish Water business plan talks about &euro;1.1 billion in operational efficiencies, of which this proposal is one element.  From our perspective, this must mean efficiencies to the State.  When we talk about savings, our expectation is that the savings that are made by Irish Water are not made by placing costs on local authorities.  We are looking at it from the State's perspective.  A claim of a saving of &euro;70 million per annum therefore means a &euro;70 million saving to the State and the Exchequer.  I mentioned in my opening statement that as this process moves forward we are conscious of the impact of the proposals on local authorities.  Obviously if they are left with stranded costs in areas that currently funded, that would impact on other local government sectors.  Throughout this process we have consistently tried to ensure that when water services were transferred from local authorities, their costs were met by Irish Water.  Irish Water is fully meeting payroll costs, pension costs and a contribution to our overheads.  Costs we are consistently meeting include loans taken out by local authorities before Irish Water, non-commercial loans, the cost of asset transfer, and funding offices for local authorities' water services transition offices.  We have brought back commercial rates under the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, but the local authorities have received compensation.  We have been trying to ensure that there is a level playing-field on this issue.<\/p> <p>  Our examination of other options was mentioned.  A member asked about the assessment process.  The speaker is correct in that when the service-level agreements, SLAs, were initially negotiated, the idea came from the independent assessment, which recommended a shorter period for the SLAs.  In 2013, the period of commitment became 12 years.  That was reflected in the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, which gives the potential for them to be renewed and also provides for some review mechanism.  With all that has been happening in this are over the last several years, that has been under ongoing review.  In regard to the models that have been examined, Mr. Grant and Quinn will talk more about their experience of the SLA.  The experience from both sides is pertinent.  Obviously there are two parties to the SLAs.  They are contracts.  <\/p> <p>  I made reference to a stand-alone company.  The Government has not decided to separate, but we have consistently ensured that any decisions do not pre-empt that happening at some point in the future, if that was in the best strategic interests of both water and gas.  From the outset it was very important to show that we were leveraging the experience of a utility, because a new utility from the gas sector was a big thing to set up.  People have been working very well in that regard. <\/p> <p>  In regard to the local government sector I have spoken about the financial aspect.  Certain functions were taken from local authorities in 2013.  That came from an independent assessment.  It looked at a range of issues and models and recommended that there should be a single utility.  That is what we have implemented in the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013.  As I said, the SLAs were recommended as a transition mechanism within the independent assessment, but they evolved throughout the process.  This process is not about taking functions away from local authorities, because statutory responsibility rests now with Irish Water from beginning to end.  That is irrespective of the fact that Irish Water has service-level agreements with local authorities and local authority staff are operating on the ground.  The operation from the beginning to the end is the legal responsibility of Irish Water.  Within the accountability which was described at the outset of this meeting, when something goes wrong or people are not happy with the service, the Oireachtas and the Department expect to direct their questions at Irish Water.  The transformation and evolution of the utility does not really take a function away from local authorities.  It is about determining the best mechanisms for Irish water to deliver on its statutory responsibilities in the future.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519291800,"counter":1147,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point, the &euro;70 million per annum in operational efficiencies that Mr. Quinn referenced earlier refers to payroll and related savings in overhead costs which we project will arise from an operational headcount reduction of approximately 850 staff.  To explain how we arrived at that number, there was the equivalent of roughly 4,300 staff working in water services at the end of 2017.  That was the total of both Irish Water and local authority staff.  That figure breaks down into 3,500 local authority staff and just under 800 Irish Water staff.  That 4,300 staff equivalent represents approximately 5,000 people because quite a number of people in local government work on water services part of the time and work in other service areas for the rest.  There are in the region of 1,200 to 1,300 people who do not spend all their time working on water.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right; once we fully implement the single public utility we expect to be able to operate with a reduced workforce of 3,300.  However, that would be after a number of years.  This is a complex project which must be carried out on a managed phased basis.  Part of managing that transition is making sure that the people who will be working in water services will be better supported in how they do their work.  Their work will be reorganised to better effect in order to take advantage of scale and consistency but people will also be better supported in terms of training and equipment.  It is a reduction of 1,000 from where we are today, but it will happen over a period of time and it will be managed.  <\/p> <p>  It is important to restate what Mr. Grant and Mr. Quinn have said.  There will be no compulsory redundancies.  We are not talking about job losses.  We see that we can achieve this reduction over a number of years.  Factors like retirement, normal staff turnover, voluntary redundancy and redeployment to other local authority service areas which have resourcing requirements will come into play.  These are all quite realistic and tangible benefits over the time period we are talking about.  It can be seen materialising.  As I said, 850 of the 1,000 reduction in staff numbers is on the operational headcount side.  That will generate the &euro;70 million per annum in operational efficiencies.  <\/p> <p>  There were one or two other questions.  The Deputy asked whether any element of this reduction related to a change in how we account for payroll costs.  The short answer is \"no\".  From our establishment in 2014, we have been following international financial reporting standards and they are very black and white as to what constitutes operational expenditure as opposed to capital expenditure.  We will be continuing with that.  The Deputy queried whether there would be any impact on customer service.  Perhaps Mr. Grant will want to comment on that in more detail, but we believe there will not be because there will be an improvement in service through the different mechanisms we talked about.  This is not being done only for the benefit of customer service.  It is also absolutely essential to meeting the objectives of the national development plan and to being able to meet the demands of a growing economy.  I believe they were all the questions I was going to cover.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#M00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dempsey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519291800,"counter":1148,"content":"<p>I will come in on a couple of points.  The business plan was adopted in late 2015.  In 2016 and 2017 we did a good bit of work on potential options under regional service level agreements and that type of structure.  There were many legal, implementation and structural barriers to those which suggested that the complexity of such an organisation would not result in significant benefits.  That ultimately led us to the conclusion that the track that had been followed by Scottish Water and Northern Ireland Water was the only real option to get the kind of integration of service delivery that is needed both for the performance efficiencies and the cost efficiencies.<\/p> <p>  On service, it is important to emphasise that utilities deliver the best outcomes through what is called the asset management approach to managing services.  That means that the day on which one invests in something is the day on which one commits to maintaining it and operating it optimally.  The best way to do that is to have the two services integrated.  That was one of the big gaps previously.  We have tried to close that gap but it is impossible to close it fully without having control over both services.  One must also develop the expertise required on a regional basis to support local operations.  That is why services will improve and have to improve under that kind of a regime.  There are also lessons to be learned from many of the incidents which we have had around the country in terms of the avoidance of issues, the management of critical assets and so on and these lessons will improve service.  Of course, we have a long way to go with our assets and we will continue to have incidents.  <\/p> <p>  As I said, the \"design, build, operate\", DBO, model was brought in for the purposes of delivering these sophisticated plans and maintaining them in the absence of the utility capability.  We will not exit the DBO contracts overnight or immediately.  All of our new DBO contracts are short-term operational contracts so they are very flexible.  Many of the older ones have very limited break clause capacity or no break clauses at all, so there could be significant commercial implications in seeking to terminate them.  At the same time, it is important to say that we need to develop the mature capability of the utility before we will be in a position to take them over.  However, as I have said, we have very flexible arrangements in all of the new contracts whereby we can take them back into direct operation relatively easily.<\/p> <p>  On the European Court of Justice case, there are still 37 schemes on the list involved in the case.  We are working through a programme in that regard and it is going according to plan.  Ringsend is the single biggest example of that and it is still on track for 2021.  It is our ambition for those schemes to be compliant by 2021.  Obviously we pass information in that regard on to Government which passes it on to Europe.  <\/p> <p>  On the Shannon water supply project, the imperative for that project grows more acute by the day.  The growth of demand in the greater Dublin area and issues in the midlands, such as the serious drought issues in Mullingar last year, make a compelling case for that project to be delivered at the earliest possible date.  We now have a preferred scheme.  We are very clear on that.  In April we will publish a report on the consultation process and all of the very valuable feedback we have received.  Some recent articles have been very misleading and misinterpret an awful lot of information.  Some 40% of the water resources of the Liffey currently go towards meeting the needs of the greater Dublin area.  It is at its sustainable limit.  If we had a critical dry period the greater Dublin area would be in serious trouble.  <\/p> <p>  Our demand profiles are now aligned with the national planning framework.  We have to meet them.  We have laid out the peak and headroom allowances which any normal utility would have in order to ensure that it can deliver service.  We have nowhere near that level of margin at the moment.  We are on a very tight leash as far as that area is concerned.  <\/p> <p>  There has also been some very misleading information or misinterpreted data circulated on leakage.  Leakage in the greater Dublin area is at a rate of approximately 36% or 37%.  That is about 200 million litres.  That is a massive challenge.  To save 40 million to 45 million litres of that leakage will require a massive effort.  We are committed to that.  We are working through programmes which include replacing 70 km of mains in the greater Dublin area.  We are also looking to develop a very intensive find and fix programme.  We have already implemented pressure management to the limit of what can be done without compromising service to customers in the greater Dublin area.  Getting that 40 million to 45 million litres net saving at the plant will mean fixing two, or even three, times that amount of leaks because an awful lot of it goes back to suppressed demand and other leakage.  Obviously the natural increase in the rate of leakage is quite significant in an old network.  <\/p> <p>  There is no quick way out of this other than to build a new scheme that will secure the future supply.  That is the Shannon scheme, based on water being abstracted at Parteen and piped to Dublin.  The timing of that scheme is contingent on us being able to provide the planning documentation to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The updating of the abstraction legislation is being addressed.  We would like to be able to make the planning application in the context of that new legislation.  We aim to make that submission in early to mid-2019.  We are then looking at as fast a programme as possible in order to get work started on site by 2021 and to begin delivering water to the greater Dublin area and midlands by 2025 at the latest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519291800,"counter":1149,"content":"<p>I forgot to answer the Deputy's question on the European Court of Justice.

I wish him every success and I worked closely with him when he was with Bord na M&oacute;na.  I hope we can continue that relationship.  A long and arduous process, as the witnesses know all too well, was put in place to deal with the unfortunate period that saw the setting up of Irish Water and the implementation of water charges.  There was a compromise initiated during the process to facilitate the formation of government, and from my party's perspective, this involved the retention of Irish Water itself.  How it was funded and how it is to be funded in future was subsequently addressed, following Oireachtas approval and special committee recommendations.  From here we seek to move forward.<\/p> <p>  I note what the Department and Minister have said in the presentation laid before the committee this morning.  I also note the commitment to the capital development programme and maintenance programme, which has been reaffirmed.  As other speakers have alluded to, in the context of the national planning framework and development plan there is an unaltered and uncompromised commitment, which I welcome.  There are improved accountability measures as a result of the process I mentioned, and Irish Water will be obliged to adhere to those in future.  That is welcome and it compares favourably to the position of some years ago.  The forum will improve accountability and transparency and Irish Water will have to provide greater accountability to Oireachtas scrutiny.  Will the Department elaborate on the progress being made in setting up that board, when it is expected to be completed and when it will be operational.  It is important the public sees it up and running and representing their interests, as well as those of everyone else.<\/p> <p>  I further appreciate the contention from Irish Water that there could be potential improvements in a renegotiation of the service level agreement and that it can deliver greater efficiencies or bang for one's buck, as well as improvements to services for consumers.  That contention will be investigated and negotiated in discussions involving the relevant stakeholders.  Nobody here should pre-empt that process or look to solve impending questions that will no doubt come to light during the process.  I welcome that those negotiations are due to commence.<\/p><p>I hope, expect and acknowledge that everyone will go into the talks in good faith and with the intention of representing their interests and those of their sector as well as the greater good of the taxpayer.  I welcome the comments of the Minister as mentioned by the Department in regard to assurances having been given from that quarter that service level agreements currently in place will remain so until amendment thereto is agreed by all parties.  Assurance is also given that no compulsory redundancies will result from the transformation process.  As regards the point alluded to by Ms Graham regarding costs that may accrue to local authorities resultant from possible changes, a commitment and guarantee has been given that those will not be borne by ratepayers but will be funded by the Department as is its obligation in regard to the Vote it provides for this area.<\/p><p> As regards the impending discussions and negotiations, it was mentioned that party to them will be the County and City Management Association and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which I presume represents all workers affected by the negotiations and any agreement thereafter.  I trust and expect that the unions will serve the interests of their staff well and will be cognisant of staff who may be taken on in the future and that the rights associated with such employments will also be best represented by the unions.<\/p><p> I am nervous in regard to there being no direct role for local authority members in the process.  I would have hoped for their participation, considering they are the most accountable to their electorate in regard to the provision of services on the ground, in conjunction with local authorities and Irish Water in recent times by virtue of the service level agreements and, more historically, solely with local authorities.  As other members have mentioned, local authority members are at the coalface and have the expertise and local knowledge regarding the historical significance of the provision of that service.  They are greatly cognisant that they wish that to be maintained and improved and should have a role in ensuring they can stand over any new service level agreement based on their experience and in their capacity as public representatives.  Do the witnesses think it would be wise to consider a representative body of councillors being privy to the negotiations and discussions in order to ensure wholesale support and approval for any process or agreement that emanates from them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#N01200","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519291800,"counter":1164,"content":"<p>Deputy Cowen's first question was in regard to the Water Advisory Body, which I have begun to refer to as the WAB.

In my county, we now have blue flag beaches every year, which we did not for many years, because of the treatment plants that were put in on the Waterford coastline by Irish Water.  That said, I also recognise that there are outstanding challenges in terms of major reform, which is never easy.  This involves the establishment of a national utility and the subsequent reform of the system that delivers on that utility.  It is never easy but it is very necessary and something to which I wish to give my full support.<\/p><p>As I have stated previously, as a person who has worked for a national utility for over 20 years, that being ESB Networks, I have seen at first hand the critical necessity of asset management, which was mentioned by Mr. Grant.  Although I acknowledge the role of local authorities over many years in doing their best to maintain the water systems and to deal with the huge leakage and lack of investment in those networks over many years, unfortunately, it was not managed in a sustainable way as an asset.  There has been fragmentation, lack of investment, duplication and no asset management systems in that regard.  Irish Water is going in the right direction in terms of sustaining our network to meet the critical need and in the national interest but, unfortunately, as we have seen, politics sometimes gets in the way of that.  As Irish Water moves towards the next step of transformation and reform in terms of how we manage our water networks, political interests should step aside and leave it to the unions and Irish Water management to engage in good faith, as others have said, in a comprehensive way to try to structure the steps forward for how Irish Water will deliver for our citizens and economy.  I wish the witnesses well in that regard.  It is not for this committee to predetermine those negotiations, which will be complex and difficult, but, if Irish Water, the local authorities and the unions approach them in good faith, I am confident we can achieve a very balanced outcome that will work in the national interest.<\/p><p> The delegates mentioned the operational savings.  I think they said savings of &euro;250 million had been achieved to date.  Within the reform projections, do they see further strong savings in that regard?  I presume they will be looking for efficiencies in streamlining the management of the utility.  Is there any indication of what the projected savings might be?  Ultimately, they will be to the consumer or the citizen.  We need to acknowledge the efficiencies that have been achieved, while asking if there are further efficiencies to be achieved.<\/p><p> I note why the design, build, operate, DBO, contracts were necessary.  Expertise was needed for the design, build and operation of various wastewater treatment plants in Waterford and other areas, some of which I have mentioned.  The delegates mentioned that there were contracts in the order of &euro;100 million.  Where do they lie in the future plans of Irish Water?  Is it planned to continue with them to their natural end or to try to renegotiate them?<\/p><p> On the recently announced Ireland 2040 plan which is a very ambitious plan for Ireland with strong aspirations for growth in population and economic demand, are the delegates confident that they have made adequate provision in capital projects to meet the demands of Ireland 2040, citizens and the economy?  I would like them to indicate where we stand in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#O00700","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519291800,"counter":1171,"content":"<p>The business plan sets out a target figure of &euro;1.1 billion for total operational savings, with capital savings of &euro;500 million to be achieved between 2014 and 2021.  We are on track to deliver on the target for capital savings.  On operational savings, our ambition is to deliver on the target, but we believe it is contingent on the movement to the single public utility within the timeframe.  There is significant cost tied up in it, as Mr. Dempsey explained.<\/p> <p>  On DBO contracts, we have a strong commercial management team overseeing them.  Many of them are 20-year contracts and we may well have difficulty if we did want to terminate them.  We are really not in a position to do so now.  It becomes very complicated if we have to introduce change or upgrade a plant in the middle of an operating contract.  That is where issues of value can arise.  As I said, we have a strong commercial management focus on them which has yielded savings in certain areas.  We have terminated one contract recently, purely on value terms.  We have to look at the individual contract in every single case and the cost of termination.  I have no doubt that there will be situations where we will proceed in that way.  Having said that, they are performing well.  They are good contractors which are delivering good services.  It is purely a question of whether we are continuing to achieve the best value we can.<\/p> <p>  On the Ireland 2040 plan, there is no question that meeting the needs of social and economic growth and progress presents a big challenge.  There are two levels at which it is being addressed.  In the areas where housing and economic pressures are greatest, the cities and larger urban centres, we are working with the local authorities to prioritise areas for development in order that we will be able to facilitate housing development, in particular.  We are doing a reasonable job in that regard.  There are times when we have to indicate that certain developments cannot be in service for 18 months or two years if there is significant infrastructure to be built.  We have a major programme to get rid of bottlenecks in sewers, for example.  We are working with the development community sector such as the larger housing developers.  We have a liaison engineer working with each of the larger developers to try to ensure our plans will be kept in line with their timing requirements.  It is not easy, but we are working hard to ensure that will happen.  It can be more challenging in smaller communities where we do not have planned upgrades included in our programme.  We are working to make minor capital improvements in some cases, particularly at sewage treatment plants, to try to get an extra 10% to 15% out of them.  That has been very successful, but it is a challenge.<\/p> <p>  We will take a very important step during the summer when we publish the national water resources plan for Ireland.  It will set out a strategy for sustainable drinking water production.  It will examine the many abstractions that are probably unsustainable in terms of quality and the capacity to abstract in a dry period.  We will look at how we will rationalise the system over time in order that we will get to a sensible number of schemes, going from 1,000 odd to something like 300 or 350.  The plan will set out a proposition, subject to a strategic environmental assessment, in order that we will examine how we can ensure there will be sustainable, adequate water supplies everywhere across the country.  I have touched on the position in the greater Dublin area and the midlands.  Clearly, the strategy needs to be national.  We will put it out for a public consultation process mid-year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":1172,"content":"<p>On customer service and engagement, a lot of the work done by Irish Water seeks to build public confidence.

Because there is a history with the brand of Irish Water, I emphasise that whatever financial efficiencies are being made throughout the company, resources must be put into ensuring the public will receive every service possible.  I understand the hotline is working very well, which is welcome, but the delegates might look at other ways of engaging with the public, particularly in rural communities.  Organisations such as An Taisce have road shows at schools and in communities in order to provide information.  I ask the delegates take a creative approach.  Water is a vital resource.  It is one of the services that really agitates the public because of the history of the brand.<\/p><p>Therefore, every resource should be put into ensuring that the public is informed of the move towards this single utility and that it is up to date on what is happening.  This reflects back on what Deputy O'Dowd said about transparency.  There must be full transparency.  The worst thing for us as a nation are the people's grievances.  As public representatives, we hear these grievances.<\/p><p> The Green Party has received many calls with regard to the Shannon-Dublin project.  In particular, there is a question about the data that are being used.  There have been many efficiencies achieved as a result of the first fix scheme but our information is that Irish Water is using data from before the leakages were fixed.  There may, therefore, be a question over the actual demand in the greater Dublin area.  The level of demand may be such that it is not necessary to take water from the Shannon and transport it across the midlands into the Dublin area.  I am relaying what we are hearing.  There was a request to invite representatives of Irish Water again to deal with some of these issues.  I want to bring to the witnesses' attention, however, that there are public concerns about this particular scheme and that the data being used by Irish Water is not necessarily the relevant data.<\/p><p> In his response to Senator Murnane O'Connor, Mr. Grant referred to benchmarking.

I am well aware of the excellent An Taisce programme and that is our intent as well.<\/p> <p>  We plan in the next six to eight weeks to launch five metrics on which Irish Water's success will be based and we will publish those every six months.  Those five metrics include drinking water quality, as measured by the EPA, and it will be based on the 44 locations where raw sewage was pumped into the lakes, rivers and sea and our progress towards eliminating that by 2021.  We will also publish the current and prior six month leakage rates by county in order to show the improvement we have made in each of those local authorities.  We will speak about our capital delivery programme, which is ramping up significantly over the next number of years, as well as headroom around the country.  We will publish the headroom for every county, on a county by county basis, in support of economic development.  Those five metrics will be published every six months and we will be publishing the plan with targets over the next five years.  That should aid the public in understanding where Irish Water is progressing.<\/p> <p>  I do not think that we have done a good job engaging with the public on the challenges facing Irish Water.  For information, we ran a survey in the fourth quarter of last year which showed that 72% of people in Dublin believe the water services are either good or excellent.  There is a complete lack of knowledge around the state of the infrastructure that provides those services.

Getting the information out to the public straight away and informing them alleviated an awful lot of problems and concerns and I appreciate the fact that public representatives were included in the process.<\/p> <p>  Equally, public education is still required.  There is still a blame game as to who is responsible and whether it is the local authority or Irish Water which is why there is a need for a single utility.  There should be only one person responsible.  I appreciate that that is the way we are heading.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a few points around the fast-tracking of the service level agreement from 2025 to 2021.  Irish Water wants to terminate it and does not want to enter another service level agreement.  Currently, the local authority staff are employed.  After the service level agreement finishes, will all those employees, who are now working on behalf of Irish Water, be transferred to Irish Water?  What exactly is the situation when the service level agreement comes to an end?  Who will employ them?<\/p> <p>  It is obvious today that there might be a need for another meeting to deal with more operational and technical issues but I want to hit on a few of them now.  Sewage connections in back gardens were mentioned.  If the connections for four or five houses are in one's garden, one is responsible for them.  I understand this situation has been inherited and that is the way it is.  Moving forward and planning for the future, however, is it now ensured when planning permissions are granted that each household connects directly to the public sewer and that there are no collective connections into a private garden which is then connected to the public sewer?<\/p> <p>  There are 31 or 32 different rates for connection fees and development levies.  What progress has been made towards bringing all that into one?  I will also mention the matter of commercial water.  How close are we to harmonising commercial water rates?<\/p> <p>  On local authorities, the word on the ground is that there are some blockages to large scale developments.  I might have a chat with the witnesses later on about the liaison officers they identified earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#Q00500","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519291800,"counter":1182,"content":"<p>The objective is to bring all the staff within Irish Water and that is a big part of the discussion to be had.

It is frankly a shame that that did not happen much sooner.  It was a huge issue.  The consultation period for the new connection charge regime is ongoing.  There is about another month in that.  That will be a massive improvement for us because it means that every single house will be charged &euro;1,900 for a water connection, assuming the figure is confirmed by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.

At the moment, we have to calculate them using square metres, areas and all kinds of things which are very complex.  The harmonisation of commercial charges is ongoing but it is not as advanced.  It is very complicated, as members can imagine, and it will take quite a few years to bring them all to harmonisation because some of the differences are stark.

I want to try to tease out two things.  One is the question of local authority workers who are the subject of the service-level agreement, SLA.  The unions will be in later to talk to us about it.  The witnesses say they will save &euro;70 million a year by streamlining this.  That would be &euro;280 million for the four years that they are trying to cut short the SLA by, yet, at the same time, they are using many contractors.  Our experience as public representatives has been that the cost of those contractors has been very high.  The contracting out of metering, for example, cost in the region of &euro;600 million.  There was much controversy at the time about the cost of that and how those contracts were awarded, etc.<\/p> <p>  I would like to tease out how the witnesses balance the use of contractors against the cutting short of the service-level agreement.  One of my best friends is one of the most senior people in Dublin City Council's water department and he knows the system inside-out, back-to-front and upside-down.  When he goes, much very important knowledge, information and experience will go with him.  I know he will not move across to Irish Water because he is like most of those workers who are terrified that their permanency as public servants, their pensions, etc., will not be carried over with them.  They have every reason to be worried about that, particularly since the Government does not seem to be giving us a referendum on the question of keeping water in public hands.<\/p> <p>  I recently had cause to go in-depth into the question of what the witnesses were talking about there, getting the support of elected Members.  I had a visit to my office from a contractor with Irish Water asking me if our locally elected representatives, both councillors and Deputies, involved in the campaign about water charges, would be willing to co-operate with Irish Water in an attempt to install meters for all the homes in a certain district metering area, DMA, in Crumlin, to detect leaks.  He went into detail, showed me plans and so on.  My argument to him, which I would like to put to Mr. Grant, is as follows.  If one wants to win the confidence of public representatives and to work with people to change the nature of how we treat water in this country and work with each other to ensure this precious resource is protected, to stop the leaks etc., would it not be wise in the first place for Irish Water to fix all the leaks that it can which exist outside of people's homes, not those at their homes?  That would include leaks across the network, including under main roads.  Mr. Grant mentioned a figure of 70 km of mains.  I do not know if that is for Dublin or everywhere.  Would it not be wise to fix those first and then go to the public to point out the marvellous job done.  Instead of 36% leaking as it is currently, Irish Water could reduce it to 7% which is, according to its own statistics, roughly the amount of leakage that it relates to household use.<\/p> <p>  Instead of that, Irish Water is coming into areas, fixing big leaks on Bangor Road and Aughavanagh Road and, at the same time, asking us as public representatives to work with communities to say that it is okay for Irish Water to put a meter outside houses for ten days to suss out if there is a leakage in the house or not.  What do the witnesses think ordinary people will immediately perceive as being attempted here?  The attempt here is not just to accept the leaks, which I accept is bona fide, but also to try to establish who can be billed for excessive usage when Irish Water starts billing them next year.  There is a problem.<\/p> <p>  The Water Services Act, which informs what Irish Water determines is excessive usage, is deliberately ambiguous.  It is deliberately ambiguously designed so that we do not know or cannot determine what excessive usage is or how Irish Water will determine who has excessive usage.  A programme such as Irish Water is proposing for Crumlin would absolutely not get people's trust.  I suggest that Irish Water needs to get the trust of the people and their elected representatives before it embarks on trying to meter homes again.  That is lethal and it will certainly not win the hearts and minds of people in bigger communities, certainly in Dublin.  I imagine it is the same in Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#R00400","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":1187,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#R00500","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":1188,"content":"<p>This is a dangerous road to go down.

On the staff in local authorities, what is done internally and what is contracted, there are, broadly speaking, similar arrangements in all local authorities with regard to the work that is insourced and the work that is traditionally outsourced.  It can vary from local authority to local authority.  Our intention is to remain consistent and true to that.  If anything, our ambition would be to be able to insource more work through the development of the capabilities we have talked about.  Contractors are used for two purposes, including delivering on one-off capital projects and major capital programmes, and for delivering specialist maintenance.  We are currently also using design-build-operate, DBO, contracts, but in the fullness of time, I hope we will not need that to the same extent.  There is no question of substituting what is currently insourced, done by public sector staff, with contractors.  That will not happen.  That will be integral to the discussions we will have and we will have no difficulty in giving those assurances in those discussions.<\/p> <p>  I have talked about the question of personal knowledge.  We hugely value the local knowledge that people have of the network.  Equally, it is not a consistent and reliable basis on which to run a business or to plan investments and we have put a huge amount of work in.  A significant part of the investment was to have the capability to gather information on the networks, all the incidents that happened, and so on, and to build that.  When we come to replace 70 km of pipe in the Dublin area, that is on the back of information we have about burst frequency, service levels and all those kinds of things.<\/p> <p>  In relation to our current work, we are not currently carrying out any active metering of domestic properties.  We are doing critical work under our current programmes to replace backyard lead services.  This is a critical public health issue which everyone should be focused on.  We currently have between 25,000 and 30,000 people fed from old backyard lead services which are almost guaranteed not to comply with the lead in drinking water standard, which is a serious health issue for young babies and infants in the womb.  We have brought much focus to this since we came in.  It has gone under the radar a lot.  The second thing about those backyard services is that they invariably leak enormously.  They are now under patios, extensions and so on.<\/p><p>A critical part of the programme of work we have is to put in individual services to the front of the houses, with stopcocks, which provide individual new non-lead services to those properties.  Equally, we are replacing public side lead services in parts of the country.  That is the programme of work that is ongoing at present.  At times it has met with resistance because people confuse it with the metering work and in those cases we have engaged with and do engage with local elected representatives to help us to explain the purposes of what we are doing.  We would see that as an important support. <\/p><p> As regards leakage, reducing leakage is a massive problem wherever it is.  The leakage rate of 36% in the greater Dublin area will be reduced over time, towards the figure of 20%.  We will never get below a leakage rate of 20% based on the best that has been achieved in the UK or Northern Ireland water systems, simply because of the nature of the assets and the average pipe age, which in Dublin is about 85 years.  Frankly, much of the cast iron, which people regard as old and decrepit is actually better than a lot of the asbestos and PVC pipes laid in the 1960s, 1970s and even into the 1980s.  Our job in reducing the level of leakage is enormous.  People will see a significant increase in the number of holes in the ground related to repairs we will be carrying out.<\/p><p> Our focus on customer side leakage is usually driven by customer complaints, about pressure and lack of service.  The vast bulk of the work we do, particularly around large leaks, is related to getting those leaks fixed and as many are on the customer's property, we engage with them and we offer a first fix, if that is appropriate.  That work is ongoing.<\/p><p> As far as the excess use charge is concerned, there is no point in me speculating on how that might operate because that is a matter for the regulator to consider in the context of the legislation.  Our job will be simply to respond to whatever is finally set out there but our primary purpose is to ensure proper service to customers, adequate pressure and that leaks are repaired.  I mentioned earlier that currently we are directly speaking to 4,000 householders about leaks that are averaging 12.5 tonnes of water every day each, which is equivalent to the water consumption of 35 houses.  Those leaks are causing damage on those properties or to a neighbour's property.  As well as the householder in question, these leaks are certainly impacting on the water pressure and the water services to their neighbours.  There is a significant benefit in getting those leaks fixed and having that service restored. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#R00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":1191,"content":"<p>I totally agree with Mr. Grant that there is a significant benefit in getting the leaks fixed and I think that should be the primary objective of Irish Water, particularly as there is still a leakage rate of 36% in Dublin.  My point relates to the way Irish Water is going about it, if meters are being installed, albeit for ten to 12 days outside homes in Crumlin and Ballyfermot and so on, Irish Water will not win the trust of the public.  If Mr. Grant is saying that the objective is to fix the lead piping, one would need to do it in every house and therefore one would not need meters installed on a temporary basis.  The public is automatically going to be suspicious that those meters will give Irish Water and the State an indication of what is called excessive use.  We still do not know because of the deliberate ambiguity in the law what that amounts to.  Fixing the leaks should be absolutely our priority.  I was shocked to learn that we will never get below a 20% leakage rate in Dublin.  Let me emphasise strongly that Mr. Grant is going about the task of winning the support of the public in the wrong way.  Mr. Grant does not have my support for doing so in the manner that it is being done.  According to the contractor I met, meters are going to go into the ground.  Mr. Grant is saying that the meters will not go into the ground, but somebody is not getting it right here.

At present we have not been putting in metering but we are obliged under the provisions of the legislation to put in meters on new buildings and on the refurbishment of a building in the fullness of time.  In the case of specific leaks or specific demand, putting in a temporary meter is probably the only way to quantify what is going on.  It can be a very valuable way of tracing leaks.  I do not know what is happening in any specific contract area but what I can say is that anybody who has old lead services, if we are there to repair, it is a tremendous service and should be supported because it is critical to the health issue around lead.  The lead standard is coming down, not going up.  The World Health Organization rates all the health issues we have to address, and beyond boil water notices, lead in drinking water is the most serious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018022200002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":1193,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Grant.

Again, I asked the secretariat to circulate a copy of that presentation, again with the intention of trying to answer some questions that members might have on the programme.<\/p> <p>  The SAFE public services card programme is simply about verifying the identity of people engaging with public services.  It is no more or less than that.  Everyone accepts that the public service has an obligation to know who it is dealing with and to whom it is providing services, entitlements and payments.  There are a number of really good reasons that is important.  Public bodies need to ensure they are providing services to the right person and ensure that somebody else is not pretending to be that person, as well as to ensure the person is not claiming to be somebody else, either with a real or false identity.  That is needed to safeguard public services and public moneys, so as to ensure they are not incorrectly or mistakenly delivered or to ensure they are not fraudulently achieved by someone.<\/p> <p>  Public bodies need to be sure of who they are dealing with so they do inadvertently expose personal and sensitive data to the wrong person, again either by accident or because somebody is perpetrating fraud.  We need to do this to ensure we comply with data protection law and that we safeguard the privacy and confidentiality of individuals engaging with us.  As all public bodies need to verify the identity of people to some extent in the provision of services, it makes sense we do it in a way that does not require an individual to go through time-consuming processes to prove his or her identity over and over again.  In other words, a person should be able to verify his or her identity once and it would hold for all interactions with public bodies.  We do this to ensure efficiency in the delivery of services; this includes efficiency for the public service and, equally, efficiency for the individual engaging with us.  Finally, there is now and expectation - even a demand - that public services can be provided digitally.  As a result of the remote and non-personal nature of digital engagement, it is impossible to know with whom one is dealing online unless the identity is verified with tokens in advance.  Consequently, an identity verification process is critical to being able to platform services digitally.<\/p> <p>  In the past, identity was relatively easy to verify as most people were known in their local communities and their identities could be testified to by other local individuals, such as doctors, teachers, garda&iacute;, clergy, etc.  However, given the remarkable changes the country has experienced in the past few decades, when we have seen considerable immigration, significant population growth and greater urbanisation, we are now a much more diverse and cosmopolitan society.  The traditional ways we had of establishing and verifying identity do not work as well as they used to.  Consequently, in 2004, the then Government tasked a senior level interdepartmental group with developing a framework or standard for establishing and authenticating the identity of individuals in their engagements with the public service.  That work was completed and agreed by the Government in 2005.  The framework emerging from it was called SAFE, which means standard authentication framework environment, and it comprised four levels of identity verification, which we set out at question No. 1 in the comprehensive guide, if members wish to look through that.  I can go through it in details if members wish.<\/p> <p>  This is very similar to the approach taken in other countries, both at that time and since.  It is also very similar to various kinds of standards set out by different groups dealing with identity over the past couple of decades.  Most of them have adopted a similar four-tier model to what has been set out in the SAFE framework we have in the comprehensive guide.  Under this framework, the traditional ways of verifying identity would be classed as SAFE 0 equivalent, where no PPS number was involved in the transaction, or SAFE 1 equivalent, where a PPS number but very little else was involved.  In the first case, identity is asserted with no assurance and in the second it is being established on the balance of probabilities only.  SAFE level 2, on the other hand, involves many factors, and we have set out the processes involved in the comprehensive guide at question No. 7.  It is the combination of all those factors that make it different and which allow identity to be verified to a substantial level of assurance.  I can go through that in minute detail if anyone on the committee wants me to.  As it is capable of verifying identity to a substantial level of assurance, it is now Government policy that it should be the level of identity verification required to provide high value and personalised services to people for the four big reasons I mentioned at the start.<\/p> <p>  It is always important to keep remembering that this is about verifying identity only and nothing else really.  The data collected during a SAFE 2 identity verification are the basic identity data items one would expect to be collected when somebody is verifying identity.  Essentially, they are the same as those used by most modern public services throughout Europe and the world.  They include elements such as name, address, date and place of birth, nationality, sex, former surnames, photo, signature and, in Ireland's case, a PPS number.  This is called the public service identity data set, or PSI.<\/p><p>We have provided again full details of that data set in the comprehensive guide.  It is also important to note that the public service identity, PSI, is not new.  It has existed in various formats since the 1970s, when PPS numbers were first introduced as RSI numbers.  It has been around for a long time.  For the majority of people, the public service has all of the data already that are in the PSI.  Therefore, the SAFE identity verification process is not collecting any new data for those people.  It is simply verifying the basic identity data that are already held in the PSI.  The process is only collecting all of the data afresh or anew where a person does not have a PPS number.  In most cases, those are adults coming to Ireland from abroad.<\/p><p> Once a person successfully completes a SAFE 2 process, he or she may be issued with a public services card as a physical token of proof that he or she has successfully identified his or her identity to a substantial level of assurance.  That is all that the card is; a physical token of proof that the person has been through the process and verified his or her identity to a substantial level of assurance.  It means that a person who gets a public services card does not have to engage in further identity verification processes when dealing with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or any other public body.  In addition, a person may be provided with an online MyGovID account, as digital proof that he or she has successfully identified his or her identity to a substantial level of assurance.  Then using that account, because it provides that proof, he or she can access public services digitally and access his or her own information and data digitally.  <\/p><p> In the context of SAFE, the public services card, PSC, and MyGovID, the only data that are shared with other public bodies is that basic identity I listed earlier -  nothing more.  It is only shared in the context of that public body being a specified body in the legislation, having a transaction with the individual concerned and in the performance of its public function as it relates to that particular person.  Additionally, these basic identity data are the only data that are stored on the public services card.  It is important to note that contrary to some misleading information from some commentators, the PSC and the data sharing arrangements for identity data do not contain any other data or information on people, such as people's means, financial data, scheme data, relationship data, health, medical, property or asset data.  No such data are on the public services card and no such data are transferred in the data sharing arrangements that are in place around identity.  The public services card does not provide access to data of that kind.  <\/p><p> We have set out in the comprehensive guide the various legal bases for SAFE identity validation for the PSI and for PSI data sharing and we are fully satisfied that these provisions provide a robust legal basis for the approach we have taken to identity verification.  Although the only data involved in the SAFE process are those basic identity data, we endeavour as best we can to ensure they are secured as best as possible.  Again we have set out in significant detail in the comprehensive guide how we have done that.  We have covered aspects such as the secure storage of the data, how we use role-based access to them, the obligations and training that staff must go through, the logging and auditing that we do, the encryption that we employ when we are transferring them, the destruction of the data in the company that produces the card and the various security features on the physical card itself.  It is worth noting that we have a dedicated unit in the Department that deals solely with information security generally and is our direct liaison with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p><p> In this context, the Department is acutely aware of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and its impending deadline of 25 May 2018.  In this regard the Department has established its own dedicated implementation team, which is undertaking a major programme of work to ensure compliance with the GDPR.  It has specific work streams on legislation, communications, information provision, information sharing, the forms that we use and the systems that we use.  In addition, our staff, both front-line and at management level, are getting specific GDPR training and awareness and all of that work is being overseen by a very senior level data management programme board and it is a regular feature on the management board agenda.<\/p><p> We note that some people have highlighted difficulties accessing and comprehending some of the legislative provisions relating to the Department's identity verification processes, given the amount and complexity of social welfare legislation generally.  Accordingly we have published an administrative consolidation of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, in which we have endeavoured to encompass all Acts since 2005 up to and including the Social Welfare Act 2017.  That is now available on the Department's website for access.  As is usual with such administrative consolidations, it comes with the usual caveats about errors and omissions and cautions against using the text in legal proceedings.  However, we hope it does help people to better understand the legislative provisions relating to these matters.  <\/p><p> Following on from that, we also note that a number of commentators have expressed concerns about section 5 of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017, which proposes to allow individuals to voluntarily provide their PSC to non-specified bodies, as proof of identity.  We note that some of those commentators have expressed a view that this proposal will result in current protections being withdrawn and that as a result, private companies will have access to the identity data.  Let me make it really clear to the committee that nothing could be further from the truth.  It is exactly the opposite.  At present, only public bodies specified in legislation and currently included in Schedule 5 to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act or their agents can ask for and use the public services card.  The current proposal in section 5 of the social welfare Bill does not change this at all.  That protection will remain if that legislative proposal is adopted.  It will not be watered down or changed in any way whatsoever.<\/p><p> However, as the law currently stands, even if a card holder volunteers his or her PSC, a private sector organisation would be committing an offence by accepting it as it is not a specified body.  Our customer feedback is that people should be allowed to volunteer the card to non-specified bodies if it suits them to do so for the purposes of verifying identify, such as when signing up to a utility company contract or opening an account with a financial institution.  Therefore the legislative proposal is that non-specified bodies that accept a PSC that is offered to them voluntarily by the holder should not be prosecuted or at risk of such prosecution.  At the same time, such non-specified organisations should not be able to request or force a person to use their PSC and that would remain an offence.  In other words, the key issue is that the volunteering of the card is at the heart of the transaction.  Furthermore and for the sake of absolute clarity the proposal in no way allows a private sector body to access the customer data on the card chip or any Government database.  It simply allows such bodies to view or accept the card as a form of identity and stops it being an offence for them to accept it - similar to any other State-issued identity documents, such as a driver's licence or a passport.  This measure will be beneficial to holders of the public services card most especially those who do not hold a driving licence or a passport.  It is the Department's view that it is their identity and as such, the holder should be allowed to volunteer it if he or she so chooses, even in a commercial setting.  <\/p><p> As the committee is aware, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is undertaking an audit of the various elements of the identity verification infrastructure that I have described here.  The Department is co-operating fully with that audit and has already furnished the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner with a great deal of information and records to assist it with that audit.  The commissioner has now furnished the Department with her plan for the completion of the audit, including timelines and I believe the committee has been copied with that information.  What members may not know is that the Commissioner for Data Protection wrote to the Department late yesterday evening and has slightly revised the timescale and pushed it out a little bit.  Contrary to information provided by others to the committee, this is not the first time that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has used its powers to conduct such an audit and there are a number of examples of same on that office's website, including a previous one done in our Department some years ago.  The Department looks forward to the preliminary findings of the commissioner and discussing them with her with a view to dealing as quickly as possible with any issues she may identify.<\/p><p>In the meantime, the Department will continue to conduct its business as usual, as is normal in such circumstances.  I hope the foregoing gives the committee a reasonable understanding of the important aspects of SAFE and the public services card, PSC.  My colleagues and I will endeavour as best we can to answer any questions that members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018022200002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519295400,"counter":1215,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Duggan and call on Mr. Lowry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018022200002#F00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519295400,"counter":1216,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me here today to inform the discussion on the public services card and MyGovID.  My name is Barry Lowry and I am the Government chief information officer.  My objective this morning is to give the committee a sense of the strategic need to increase the adoption and usage of the card and, in particular, the MyGovID service token.<\/p> <p>  I will begin with the European context for the ongoing plans and then focus on the national interest.  As regards Europe, I was interested to read a recent comment by Thomas Donohue, chief executive and president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, who predicted that Ireland will take on a more significant role in Europe if Brexit proceeds as planned.  Given the importance of the EU to our economy, I am sure the committee fully accepts that it is essential for us to be at the forefront of any European initiatives that impact on our trade and economy.<\/p> <p>  The European Commission is extremely committed to the concept of digital government driving digital commerce and, therefore, economic growth.  It estimated that ICT is currently responsible for half of productivity growth in the EU and the digital sector is expected to grow seven times faster than the overall EU economy.  The Vice-President of the European Commission, Mr. Andrus Ansip, has, therefore, set out ambitious plans for cross-border eGovernment and the establishment of a digital Single Market.  Mr. Ansip has frequently quoted figures produced by the European added value unit indicating that, taking into account various constraints, a fully realised digital Single Market could increase GDP by &euro;340 billion a year and make a very significant contribution to overall GDP growth in Europe over the next decade.  He has repeatedly stated that governments can play a substantial role in progressing the concept of a digital Single Market by facilitating cross-border access to digital government services, whether that be an Irish citizen accessing our services regardless of his or her location or an EU citizen being able to plan to work, live or holiday in Ireland and put all of his or her arrangements in place before arriving in the country.  It is imperative that we take all possible steps to make certain we are aware of, shape and are ready to utilise such developments to ensure Ireland is not disadvantaged or left behind the rest of Europe in terms of digital trade and digital government.<\/p> <p>  EU Regulation No. 910 of 2014, often known as the eIDAS, electronic ID and trust services, regulation, addresses electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the Internal Market.  The regulation has been established to enable people and businesses to use their own national electronic identification schemes to access public services in other EU countries where eIDs are also available.  The regulation also creates legal validity for electronic signatures, seals, time stamps etc. such that they will have the same legal status as traditional paper-based processes.  If Ireland is to be recognised as a progressive digital state within Europe, then we must have a safe, secure and verifiable State eID.  MyGovID gives us a basis for that capability.  It provides substantial assurance that a person online is who he or she claims to be and gives considerable protection against personation and fraud.  It can also provide the foundation for the future use of electronic signatures.  MyGovID is the only viable approach that can underpin future citizen interaction with a digital Europe.<\/p> <p>  The EU&rsquo;s eGovernment action plan 2016-20 sets out a shared eGovernment vision and a series of principles to which member states should adhere.  The principles include that public administrations should deliver services digitally as the preferred option through a single contact point or a one-stop-shop; that they should ensure that citizens and businesses only need to supply the same information once to a public administration; that public administration offices should take action if permitted to internally re-use these data, in due respect of data protection rules, such that no additional burden falls on citizens and businesses; and that public administrations should share information and data with one another and enable citizens and businesses to access, control and correct their own data and monitor the administrative processes that involve them.  It is reasonable to expect of any digital government that citizens be able to carry out more transactions online, provide information only once, have it securely stored for future needs and then be able to see and correct the data held on them and how they are being used.  Much of that aligns closely to the general data protection regulation, GDPR, which will come into force in May.<\/p> <p>  However, we can only do such things if we are absolutely certain that persons seeking to carry out such transactions are exactly who they say they are.  MyGovID is of great importance in that regard because it provides a very strong means of online verification.  Contrary to what some have written and stated, underpinning Government services with MyGovID and the SAFE 2 process will help us to provide more secure and transparent Government services.  Consequently, the eGovernment strategy published in July by the Minister of State with responsibility for eGovernment, Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan, set out ten key actions aimed at enabling citizens to access digital government services of similar levels of quality, transparency and safety as the leading digital countries in Europe.  These actions include the development of a digital services gateway, a roadmap for allowing citizens to authenticate themselves for any government digital service using MyGovID, plans for business and location e-identification, the means for governed data-sharing across Government, plans to build on our open data success and plans to ensure that our staff have the requisite digital skills and capabilities.<\/p> <p>  This is an area of rapidly growing national interest as increasing numbers of the public want us to proceed down this road.  In the 2017 Civil Service customer satisfaction survey conducted by IPSOS MRBI, 61% of the total consulted and 76% of those in the 18-34 age category agreed or strongly agreed that they would be more inclined to use online Government services as their preferred method of initial engagement with the Civil Service, provided they were easier to find and use.  Some 65% of the total, and 82% of the 18-34 age category, thought that a single digital identity would be very convenient or fairly convenient.<\/p> <p>  We have a real opportunity to provide Government services that are more efficient, convenient, transparent and provide a better user experience but that cannot be achieved without a single electronic identification scheme.  The committee is aware of the existing importance of the digital industry to Ireland.  The digital economy is estimated to account for 6% or &euro;12.3 billion of Ireland's GDP.  The digital and ICT sector is a very significant employer, offering high-quality jobs through the strong presence of global players, our world-class SME capability and the many organisations which deploy digital and ICT as part of their day-to-day business.  Research completed for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation&rsquo;s future skills needs analysis stated that there was a growth in ICT jobs provision of around 8% to 9% from 2016 onwards, with demand partly being met through attracting foreign talent.  More than 6,500 ICT employment permits have been issued in the past two years.  A compound annual growth rate of 8.5% per annum is expected from 2017 to 2022.  Although this requirement will again be helped by the recruitment of foreign talent, it also offers tremendous opportunities to our current and prospective workforce through graduate recruitment, apprenticeships and retraining schemes.  If we accept that talented workers are more likely to apply to and stay with companies that deploy digital technology well, it must follow that countries which provide an optimised citizen experience through the use of digital and ICT will be more likely to attract and retain the best talent.<\/p> <p>  I hope my opening statement has been helpful in briefly giving the committee an indication of the importance of the role that MyGovID and the underlying SAFE 2 process can and must play in establishing Ireland as a European digital and eGovernment leader, helping it to attract and retain the highest quality jobs and best talent and providing government services to its people that are safer, more efficient and more transparent than ever before.<\/p><p>I am very happy to listen to the committee's views and answer any questions members may have to the best of my ability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018022200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Lowry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519295400,"counter":1218,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lowry.

From Mr. Duggan's statement, it seems that one of the primary purposes of the card is to be an anti-fraud device.  He emphasises that very strongly.  We know social welfare fraud is a phenomenon here just as it is in every other country.  The level here is relatively low, at around &euro;40 million a year, which is not insignificant but it is a hell of a lot less than we were told during the anti-fraud campaign last year, when figures of &euro;500 million were mentioned.  The other aspect of the card is convenience, as one does not have to produce all this information every time one is looking for a passport or whatever.  As Mr. Lowry has pointed out, it is very important that we be digitally up with our competitors.<\/p> <p>  On the controversy that has surrounded the public services card, Mr. Duggan says that if one produces the SAFE 2 evidence, one may get a card.  Is that automatic?  If someone applies for some sort of welfare benefit and produces the information sufficient to meet the requirements of SAFE 2, does he or she automatically get the card or does it have to be requested?  People who come in with sufficient information to satisfy the requirements of SAFE 2 are being told they must produce the card before they are entitled to whatever they are looking for, be it a social welfare entitlement or whatever.  If people go through the SAFE 2 process, can they say they do not want the card and would prefer to produce the information, however inconvenient it may be for themselves and the person dealing with them every time they come in?  If somebody is not in possession of a card, the legislation states that the data on the card can be shared with other stipulated public bodies.  If somebody does not seek the card but completes the SAFE 2 process, is that information also shared?<\/p> <p>  What exactly is the data commissioner investigating at the moment?  It is taking quite a considerable length of time by all accounts.  If everything is as straightforward, clear and above board as we are being told today, what precisely is she investigating?<\/p> <p>  How many public services cards are in existence at the moment and what was the cost of producing them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018022200002#G00900","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1519295400,"counter":1226,"content":"<p>I welcome the officials.  There has certainly been huge concern among the public and organisations dealing with civil liberties, for example, as well as on the part of the data commissioner.  The commissioner issued comprehensive questions to the Department.  Is she satisfied with the responses that have been given to date?  Has she asked for further information?<\/p> <p>  Following on from Deputy O'Dea's point about the number of cards issued to date, can we have a full breakdown of costs?  When was the contract signed and when is it due to expire?  What is the overall cost of the contract?  How many cards do the officials anticipate will be issued?<\/p> <p>  A lot of the debate and controversy has been fuelled by the officials' own Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, who stated that the card was mandatory but not compulsory.  There is still a lot of concern.  Any time Ministers open their mouths, they seem to muddy the waters even further.  There is still huge concern that this is compulsory and that it is the introduction of a national identity card through the back door by stealth.  I and my party have serious concerns in that regard, as do members of the public and many organisations.  It is a legitimate concern.  I genuinely believe that this is the introduction of a national ID card.<\/p> <p>  I question the legal basis for the introduction of this card.  I listened to Mr. Duggan and read through his presentation before he delivered it this morning.  I do not think there is a legislative basis for the introduction of the card.  Section 263 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 allows the card as an option.  It does not say that it should be rolled out.  It merely provides that the Minister may require any persons receiving a benefit to satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity.<\/p><p>It does not specifically state a card should be introduced; it just mentions the need for a person to satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity.  Will the delegates expand on their points to say there is a legal basis for it, as I do not think there is?  There have been a number of high profile cases in which people have had their payments, including pension payments, etc. stopped.  In one case a lady had her pension payments stopped for over 18 months because she did not have a public services card, only for them to be restored later.  How many other cases have there been to date in which any type of payment has been stopped because the individual did not have a public services card?<\/p><p> Another issue has arisen.  It involves people who have been adopted who have been told to obtain a public services card.  We know that up to 100,000 Irish people have been adopted.  Of these, approximately 40% do not know that they have been adopted.  This has caused much concern.  People are told to go to the Intreo office to obtain a public services card and bring the necessary documentation with them.  They are then told that they are not on the adoption register, that Intreo does not have access to it and that they need to come back with the long form of their birth certificate.  Not only are there financial implications for them in having to spend &euro;40 to obtain the long form of their birth certificate, it is also causing huge difficulties for them.  How is this issue being handled?  I do not think it is being handled properly.  There are people who want to obtain a public services card, while others are being forced to obtain it.  I ask the delegates that question about people who have been adopted and are being forced to obtain the public services card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018022200002#G01000","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519295400,"counter":1228,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I have a question about a person has not gone through it and not received a public services card.  I know that there is a system in place in the post office where one ticks a series of boxes, one of which concerns identification.  I presume a person has to tick it to show that he or she has a public services card and will automatically be paid.  In the case of the lady who did not want the public services card and specifically asked the Department for the legislation to show why she had to obtain it, it is my understanding she was told that she would not receive back money.  She eventually received it after a period and her pension payments were reinstated.  How was her case processed if she did had not gone through the SAFE process?  Questions have been raised about the Data Protection Commission.  Why has it been slightly revised and pushed out again?  Is the commissioner seeking more information from the Department?  Has there been a request for more information from the commissioner?<\/p> <p>  I am very concerned.  I do not have a public services card and do not want one until I am very clear on what it means for me.  Others have received it and have no problem with it.  What am I stopped from accessing?  We have heard about the potential to include other areas in which one would need a public services card such as Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants, passport renewals and driving licence applications, a process now run by a private company.  How far will the Department extend the system?  If in six months' time I want to apply for a driving licence, will I have to have the public services card?  I have my passport, birth certificate and PPS number.  It is not just a matter of obtaining the public services card but for what services it will be required.  How secure is the Department's systems, given that it is a private company that is involved?

Things would start to go askew.  Therefore, people are hugely concerned.

Perhaps the delegates might specify why, for example, a passport or a driving licence cannot satisfy the Minister as to a person's identity?  Is it not really the case that this is about the single customer view database?  The delegates are not really asking people to come in on one occasion to satisfy the Minister as to their identities.  The new element is that they are asking people to agree to having their information included in a single database which would have other uses.  There is the question of whether it is necessary and proportionate to do this under the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  It may well be necessary and proportionate to have somebody prove his or her identity to access a payment or benefit, but is it necessary and proportionate to require somebody to commit his or her information to a database which can be accessed by approximately 40 bodies?  Perhaps the delegates might clarify how many specified bodies can access the database.  I know that they will say this is the basic information and that the bodies will identify it in this way.  Nonetheless, it is a large number of bodies.  As I understand it, others may be added by legislation without necessarily having a requirement to obtain consent.  The potential to add other bodies is important.<\/p> <p>  The delegates mentioned that the public servicew card would simply be used to confirm identity.  It would be useful for me to know that no further information is contained on it.  Will there be a record of the number of occasions on which a person's identity has been verified and by whom?  Will there, for example, be a situation where one will be able to say the driving licence service, the health service and others have checked a person's identity?  That brings us to the issue of public or private bodies potentially accessing the information.  There is a blurring of the lines in the Data Protection Bill where private companies contracted by the HSE and others, for example, will be reclassified as public authorities.  While they may not be specified bodies, there is ambiguity about which people may be concerned.<\/p> <p>  There are key questions about the roll-out of the public services card.  The phrase \"optimised citizen experience\" was used.  It certainly was not an optimised citizen experience for many of those who were effectively threatened and, in many cases, would have had their payments cut off if they refused to agree to their information being included in a single customer database.  To clarify the position in the case of the woman whose pension payments were withheld, she did not say she did not want to have a public services card but that she wanted to know what was the legal basis.  While her payments were restored, as I understand it, the legal basis had not been satisfactorily illustrated to her.  Crucially, it has not been been illustrated to the satisfaction of the Data Protection Commissioner.  There is an ongoing investigation in that regard.<\/p> <p>  In response to Mr. Lowry, this is not about being pro or anti-digital, nor is it about the digital or data future.<\/p><p>The people who are most concerned are the ones who are most engaged and most keen for us to take a responsible approach to the digital world and data protection, given their increasing importance.  This is not a Luddite concern but about doing things properly.  If the public services card is as crucial as we hear it is, should we not be deeply concerned about getting it right?  If we are to be the main regulator of private company data regulation in Europe, should we not set high standards for ourselves?  Nobody is complaining about doing things online, but people are complaining about the lack of due respect for data protection rules.  Would it not send a very worrying signal if Ireland decided that it did not want to wait to satisfy the concerns of the Data Protection Commissioner?  She is looking at the legal basis and the appropriateness of the technological and organisational systems.  Mr. Duggan mentioned a previous data commissioner who had expressed concern in these areas, as well as dissatisfaction with the measures in place within public bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018022200002#H00600","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519295400,"counter":1234,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018022200002#J00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1519295400,"counter":1235,"content":"<p>It is crucial to get this right.

I have obtained information from the <i>Mirror<\/i>on foot of a freedom of information request on the response from the Department to a journalist last November.  It stated the initial costs associated with producing the public services card were &euro;18.284 million, ex-VAT, and that a further &euro;1.5 million in costs were related to other aspects of the project.  The sum of &euro;18.284 million allowed for a figure of &euro;347,000 towards the cost of the operation of a help desk facility to support the issuing of the public services card.  It went on to state that, subsequent to the overall contract being put in place, the then Data Protection Commissioner had requested that specific control measures be put in place to ensure that it coul be verified that the public services card had been sent to and received by the correct person.  This resulted in customers, on receipt of their public services card, being required to make contact by telephone with the Department to confirm receipt.  Essentially, the customer contacted a telephone line and the telephone line staff member recorded the fact that the public services card had been received.  Although this process became known as activation, it did not result in anything being done to the public services card or the system and cards were not invalidated if no such call was made.  The response went on to state that it was important, therefore, to note that all public services cards issued by the Department were valid and could be used with or without activation.  The departmental official went on to say the telephone line had received approximately 1.385 million calls, at a cost of &euro;2.47 million, up until August 2016 when the service was discontinued.<\/p><p>I have a number of questions.  Originally, &euro;347,000 was allocated for the operation of a hotline by then Department of Social Protection staff.  It is good practice for people to be advised how they might go about going through the process of obtaining a public services card and for the Department to address their concerns.  Because of the intervention of the Data Protection Commissioner, it appears that a new system was set up which appeare to be a hotline to nowhere.  Some 1.4 million people contacted the help desk to activate their public services card, even though activation was not required, but many who have the card did not contact the hotline.  This did not make any difference whatsoever because the cards were valid, as the Department made clear in its letter in November.<\/p><p>Is Mr. Duggan claiming a 100% success rate?  Does everybody who is meant to have the public services card have the correct one?  Are there thousands of people walking around with incorrect cards in their pockets?  If there was no requirement to activate the card, as one would with a debit or a credit card from a financial institution, what was the point in spending an additional &euro;2 million, over and above the original sum of &euro;347,000, on a hotline to nowhere?  I do not understand it.  Why was this money spent if there was no activation process and no cards were invalidated?  People were not required to contact the Department to validate their public services card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018022200002#J00400","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1519295400,"counter":1237,"content":"<p>Clarity is required.

He said that, as is usual with such administrative consolidations, it came with the usual caveats of errors, omissions and cautions against using the text in court proceedings.

There is too much emphasis on the card.  The issue is verifying identity to a substantial level of assurance.  We have established processes to do that.  The card is a side effect of that.  It is a token to say a person has gone through that process and successfully verified their identity to a substantial level of assurance.  No one has to get one but we do automatically issue it to a person as a token of proof that they have verified their identity to a substantial level of assurance.  The difficulty for a person who does not have one is how to prove to other public bodies, or to us when they come into another of our offices, that they have done it.  We would have to check through the system to make sure they had verified their identity to a substantial level of assurance.  It is the same as when a person passes a driving test and gets a certificate of competence but if they are not issued with a licence how can a garda check the person passed the test?  It is of that nature.  We issue a token to prove the identity has been verified in accordance with the law.  That is all the card is.  The Minister is quoted as saying a person can take it home and put it in a drawer and she is absolutely correct.  The difficulty, however, for the person is that they must needlessly go through some form of identity verification process if they choose not to use the card.  That is the big issue.<\/p> <p>  Fraud is also a side effect.  It is a question of making sure we are dealing with the right people, that when somebody presents we know who they are, we give them the right service and payments and no one else can pretend to be them and take their entitlement.  I think Joe Duffy highlighted an issue about treatment benefit where a lady had been impersonated and the impersonator got the treatment benefit but as a consequence the first lady did not.  We are trying to protect against incidents like that.  This is a good side effect in that anyone trying to perpetrate identity fraud is highly unlikely to get through this process and it will be very difficult to perpetrate such frauds in the future.  <\/p> <p>  The Data Protection Commissioner has set out in correspondence with the committee precisely what she is doing in her audit.  The Senator mentioned some of these actions.  She is examining the legal basis for processing data in connection with the public services card; considering the appropriateness of the technology and organisational measures we have employed in respect of security and other personal data processing operations; and examining the transparency of information provided to data subjects or customers in respect of the processing of personal data and she is doing that in respect of the public service identity dataset, the public services card, the single customer view and MyGovId.  She hopes to conclude the initial phase next month and the second phase probably in May or June.  <\/p> <p>  Somebody asked whether she had pushed it out because she had greater concerns or had looked for more information.  The answer is no.  We furnished the responses to her initial set of questions to the Department in early December.  They were very comprehensive detailed responses.  The main response ran to just under 100 pages and there were a load of documents and records associated with that which were also furnished to the Data Protection Commissioner's office.  It is a lot of information.  I suspect, given the pressures of work in other areas and the amount of information on this, it is taking longer than originally envisaged.  The commissioner has not told us why she is extending the timeline a little but we are not concerned about it.  We think it is for normal pressure of business reasons.<\/p> <p>  To date, as of this morning, 3.14 million public services cards have been issued.  That represents approximately 2.65 million people.  There are more cards than people for a bunch of reasons.  First, people's entitlements change.  A person who got it when they were younger than 18 years would automatically be issued with a new one when they pass 18.  Anyone who was younger than 66 years would get a new one after that because of the free travel entitlement.  Some people have lost or damaged cards and got new ones.  Some have expired because the original cards were five year cards.  Approximately three quarters of the adult population of the country have cards.  <\/p> <p>  The figures for the cost go up to slightly earlier than end December 2017, to the time we finished producing 3 million cards as part of our contract.  It was &euro;55.7 million for everything, including the cards, the staff and a bunch of miscellaneous costs associated with systems development.  I can break that down if the Deputy wants me to.  The Comptroller and Auditor General estimated the cost at &euro;59.7 million.  The staff costs alone are in the region of &euro;29 million because there have to be so many people on the ground for identity verification.  That contract for the production of cards concluded at the end of 2017.  We need to put a new contract in place.<\/p><p> I refer to second generation because there have been developments in card technology since we went out to market originally, therefore the next generation of public services cards will be slightly different to the current generation to reflect those advances in technology.  We are in the process of doing that at the moment, and as a consequence the contract with BCS, the original card producer, was extended under European law for a further year.  There is no volume commitment in the extended contract; it simply gives us the facility to produce first generation cards as we need them until a new contract is in place. <\/p><p> Deputy Brady asked about the Data Protection Commissioner and the responses to the 47 questions that she issued to the Department back in September.  We produced a comprehensive guide, which is an amalgam of a number of things.  It covers all of the questions the Data Protection Commissioner asked plus many of the issues that we felt were arising in the media and political coverage of the project at the time.  As a consequence we put that comprehensive guide together.  We furnished it to the Data Protection Commissioner in October of last year, and we have not heard whether she has any difficulty with any of the responses provided in that guide since.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018022200002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519295400,"counter":1243,"content":"<p>Did she not initiate the investigation following the responses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018022200002#L00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519295400,"counter":1244,"content":"<p>She did; it was approximately one month or five weeks later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018022200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan"},{"type":"speech","time":1519295400,"counter":1245,"content":"<p>Is that not indicative of a response?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018022200002#L00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519295400,"counter":1246,"content":"<p>I do not accept that that was a response to the comprehensive guide being produced.

This is certainly the context in which the Minister answered that question all that time ago.  This is not a national ID card.  The Minister said that it is not compulsory in that context.  There is no intention for this to become a national ID card or anything of that nature.  To be boring, this is about verifying identity to a substantial level of assurance for public service purposes.  That is what this is about.  <\/p> <p>  A national ID card is an entirely different idea.  That would entail a person having an identity card that they are required to use.  They would be compelled to have the card by virtue of existing in the nation, which is the usual nature of a national ID card.  In most countries that have one people are compelled to carry it with them.  If a member of a police force in such countries stops a person and asks for his or her national ID card and he or she either does not have it or refuses to furnish it, the police can draw inferences from that, and in many countries the person can simply be detained until such time as it is produced or until the police can verify identity in another way or find out what that person is doing.  In most countries that operate national ID cards they are not only required for engaging in public services but also almost all private sector commercial-type services as well where identity is an element of consideration.  It is impossible to open any kind of financial account or to get any kind of insurance without one.  In fact, it is impossible to do fairly basic things without a national ID card.  My sister lives in a country that has a national ID card, and when video stores were a thing the card had to be produced to open an account with a store in order to rent a video.  <\/p> <p>  National ID cards are an entirely different thing to the public services card.  The public services card cannot be asked for by anyone other than a specified body in the legislation.  It is illegal to request it otherwise.   Organisations that have attempted this in the past have been threatened with prosecution.  It is illegal for a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to request a public services card as it is not a specified body.

I do not hear it being described as a national identity number because it is not.  The national ID card is essentially the same thing.  All the card contains is the public service identity dataset that people have had since they were issued with a PPS number.  All that is on that card is basic identity information.

To date, no one has been provided with such access.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the legal basis for the card, as I said earlier, the whole purpose of the card is to verify identity to a substantial level of assurance.  If a person is a customer of the Department, we rely on section 247 of the Social Welfare Act to require them to satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity.  We do not require them to get a public services card, but rather to satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity by virtue of section 247.  We have always told people that that is the basis on which they must go through the safe process.  Section 247 sets out that we have to give notice to a person who is receiving a benefit.  That is covered by the letter we write to people.  If a person does not satisfy the Minister he or she may be disqualified from receiving the benefit.  In fact, the section uses the word \"shall\", so the Department has no discretion under the law.  A person may satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity by attending at an office that the Minister designates and provide the information and documents the Minister requires.  The items that must be furnished are set out in the notices sent to the people in question.  It includes the types of items that one would expect, such as photographic ID and proof of address.<\/p><p>Claimants must have a photograph and provide their signature.  The statute gives the Minister the power to retain those, so that they can be reproduced by electronic means in the future.  One of the parts of that provision on which people have seized is the following stipulation: &quot;This section shall not be construed as preventing the Minister from using a method of authentication of the identity of a person in receipt of benefit, other than a method referred to in this section, which the Minister considers appropriate to use.&quot;  People have asked why a passport or driving licence would not be appropriate.  I am sorry for being boring about this, but the issue here is that we are trying to verify people's identity to a substantial level of assurance.  That is not verification on the balance of probabilities or on the basis of assertion.  That section means that the method we use is still intended to verify the identity to a substantial level of assurance.  We use alternatives to a face-to-face meeting in Intreo centres or branch offices around the country.  In some cases we have used mobile solutions.  In these situations a claimant does not have to turn up at our office.  We go to them, either in their place of work, in a congregated setting or indeed in their home, as has happened in several exceptional occasions.  <br\/><br\/>In a second variety of case, somebody in a particular set of circumstances is unable to furnish all of the documentation that is ordinarily required to satisfactorily prove identity.  For those cases we have an exceptions process, whereby we still put them through an interview, but the interview changes in that we ask for a range of information for which we do not ordinarily ask.  We carry out background checks to make sure that their answers hold up.  We assign senior officers, rather than normal officers, to reviewing that information and determining whether the identity has been verified satisfactorily.  <br\/><br\/>The third type of scenario is that in which we have used postal processes, in two different ways.  The first of these is where somebody who has a passport and is over the age of 66 is paid in cash at a post office, and all of the identity data that the Passport Office has for that individual precisely matches our own data.  In those circumstances, the risk is mitigated significantly, and we are willing to offer that person a postal process to effectively satisfy the Minister as to their identity.  We write to the person and ask them for any information that we need to verify.  We also ask them to provide some security questions to protect their account so that no-one else can pretend to be them.  We are willing to furnish them with a public services card, PSC, in those circumstances, having satisfied ourselves that their identity has been verified to a substantial level of assurance.  The kickback is that this person turns up at a post office, usually every week, to get their payment, and their identity can be validated.  The verification is <i>post-factum <\/i>rather than before the event.  The claimant walks in with their public services card, which has their photograph and signature on it, and they collect their payment.<br\/><br\/>There is always an element of face-to-face engagement, but the point at which it is done varies.  In the last several years, we have done similarly for people who have renewed their driving licence, again where their data precisely matches the identity data held by the Department.  Quite a number of people have been able to satisfy the Minister as to their identity and have their identity status elevated to SAFE 2 level as a consequence of going through that process. <br\/><br\/>As such, there are at least five methods by which we are able to identify somebody to a substantial level of assurance to the satisfaction of the Minister, all operating under that legislation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018022200002#L01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519295400,"counter":1257,"content":"<p>I have heard a number of quite credible reports from people who have received public services cards in the post but do not recall having applied for or sought a public services card.

I invite members to imagine the situation when somebody goes into an Intreo centre to go through the SAFE process.  The SAFE officer has no idea who the person is, and has no idea of his or her birth status, adopted status, or anything like that.  There is no difference in the Department's treatment of people on the basis of whether they have been adopted or not.  If they are a customer of the Department and have been invited to appear, then they have been issued with a letter which tells them very clearly what they need to bring with them to go through the process.  In the case of adopted people, that includes an adoption certificate.<\/p> <p>  The SAFE officers in the Department have full access to the register of births.  Consequently we do not require people to bring their birth certificate with them to their appointment.  We encourage them to bring it along if they have it, but we do not absolutely need it.  If I appear and give my name and date of birth, the officer is able to directly check the register of births to make sure I am there.  <\/p> <p>  However, if I am an adopted person, I will not feature on that register.  I am unlikely to be on it under the name I have given, and perhaps even with the date of birth I have given.  Consequently, all the SAFE officer knows is that he or she cannot find the person on the birth register.  This can also happen with people who are not adopted.  I do not want the committee to think that this just happens with adopted people.  It happens just as often with people who have not been adopted.  In those circumstances, the SAFE officer simply advises the person concerned to go to his or her local register to get a birth certificate.  The SAFE officer does not know if the person is adopted or not, and it does not matter to the SAFE officer.  Those are the circumstances in which that occurs.  <\/p> <p>  When a person who is adopted gets an adoption certificate, it is referred to as a birth certificate.  When they produce this document, the SAFE officer still will not know that the claimant was adopted.  The only reason the SAFE officer would know that is if the claimant themselves told them.  <\/p> <p>  There are two different forms of adoption certificate, as I understand it.  The very detailed version, which is not required for this process, indicates near the bottom of the document that it is issued under the Adoption Act 2010.  The shorter version of the document, which is perfectly sufficient, does not say that.  Consequently, it depends on what document the claimant produces.<\/p> <p>  In addition to that, a person who is getting a birth certificate for the purposes of SAFE registration is not required to get the long-form version of their birth certificate.  They are also not required to pay the full cost of this form.  The cost of a birth certificate for SAFE registration purposes is &euro;1.  If they say they are getting it for this purpose then they will be given it for this price.  The Department will never know whether or not somebody is adopted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018022200002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1519295400,"counter":1262,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1519295400,"counter":1263,"content":"<p>Like anyone else, adopted people appear with the information and documents that they have been told are required.

As I stated in my opening remarks, 40% of adopted people do not know they are adopted.  They must then try to find that other information and get the long versions of their birth certificate.  Why is the short version of the document not accepted in those situations?  This system puts them in very difficult situations.

It is to verify that data element.  The same applies if a person is applying for, let us say, a passport.  It is unusual that it would only occur once in a person's life.

That was primarily to deal with people who had queries about the public services card, PSC, or about the SAFE 2 registration process.  That was a reasonable estimate at the time of the level of cover that would be needed.  The then Data Protection Commissioner, having looked at the project, felt that as an additional safeguard when public services cards were posted to individuals, it would be an additional protection if people were to phone back in and confirm that they had got the card.  He asked us to put that process in place.  The Department never felt that was necessary because a person validated their address and a couple of days later they were given the card.  It would be incredibly unusual for an address to change in that period.  Essentially, it would the same as someone renewing motor tax at an address only for him or her to have changed address by the time the certificate got out to them three or four days later.

If they do not use the public services card, or if they do not yet have one &ndash; we have customers who do not yet have one because we are in a roll-out programme and we have not reached everybody yet - we have a protocol with An Post whereby a person presents his or her social services card and some form of photographic ID.<\/p><p>There is a protocol for dealing with that.  The alternative to that is that the post office personnel are able to testify to the identity of the person through familiarity and knowing them for years but we want them to have the social services card because that is their record on the system for An Post personnel to pay them.<\/p><p> As for what it stops one from accessing if one does not have a social services card, the whole point is not the card but one's identity being verified to a substantial level of assurance.  The card proves that.  What public bodies do, including my own, is say that in shorthand, which is that one needs a card for this, but what they really mean is that one needs one's identity verified to a substantial level of assurance and the way one proves that is by presenting one's card.

For instance, almost 4,300 free travel customers have failed to register to SAFE 2 and have had the travel pass withdrawn.  The vast majority of those have never engaged with the Department.  Essentially, what is going on in that regard is exactly what went on with my own Dad who is in a nursing home and who will never use free travel again, so the people who were dealing with his affairs simply did not respond.

My invitation arrived on Tuesday afternoon, so I had only a few hours to prepare it and I was using a template.  Perhaps that was a Freudian slip, and I will touch on that.<\/p> <p>  The main area raised for me to address was digital and safety concerns, and the process behind moving Ireland forward in terms of the digital agenda.  To be clear, we have looked very carefully at MyGovID and its appropriateness as the single electronic identifier as opposed to other options, including starting again, and it is by far the best value for money to move forward with MyGovID.  I believe it will become ever more important in the world of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, because if people choose to make requests online on the data a public service body holds on them, we need to be absolutely certain that they are who they say they are as a data breach situation would occur otherwise.  MyGovID gives us a huge degree of protection against that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Departments sharing data, I am not a lawyer but I rely on the advice of the Attorney General's office.  When any public body is set up by the State to provide a service, its legal standing in being set up to provide that service gives it a right over certain datasets.  When Departments share data, they have to abide by the principles of GDPR anyway.  They were long established before the regulation came out, so there has to be a demonstration that the data are necessary.  There are elements of specificity and proportionality.  It has to be time-bound, and there has to be an element of consent.  All of those are strengthened by the GDPR.<\/p> <p>  The data-sharing and governance Bill will help the State comply with the European eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020 and, more recently, the Tallinn agreement, which is that we should not ask a citizen for information we already hold and record about them.  The data-sharing and governance Bill will ensure that sharing among Government bodies takes place but is driven completely by the principles of the GDPR and excludes completely sensitive data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018022200002#O02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Lowry"},{"type":"speech","time":1519295400,"counter":1317,"content":"<p>Mr. Lowry might comment also on the questions I asked in relation to the Data Protection Bill which is currently before the Houses.
