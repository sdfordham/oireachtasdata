He is accompanied by Ms Patricia Devlin, the deputy director of audit in his office.  Apologies have been received from Deputies McDonald, Cassells, Aylward and Farrell.  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 15 February 2018.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  The next item is matters arising from the minutes.  I have one question in this regard.  We wrote to the HSE a week or two ago about salary overpayments.  Has any response been received?  I understand we will have a reply to that next week.  That is grand.  It may or may not be a significant item.  We will wait and see.  We will move on to correspondence received.  We have some correspondence today.<\/p> <p>  The first item of correspondence is No. 1105A, briefing material from the Revenue Commissioners for today's meeting.  We will note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  No. 1107A is briefing material on corporation tax from Dr. Brian Keegan of Chartered Accountants Ireland for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish that and circulate it to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, both of which may also have an interest in it.<\/p> <p>  Under category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow-up to previous meetings of this committee, No. 1081 was received on 12 February last from the Higher Education Authority.  It comprises a follow-up review report, carried out by Dr. Richard Thorn, regarding certain matters and allegations relating to the University of Limerick.  We mentioned this last week.  Dr. Graham Love has requested that the report be dealt with confidentially and that it not be published.  He has also mentioned that there are three related ongoing High Court actions.  Having checked with the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser here in Leinster House, we have circulated the report.  I propose that we will respect the request for confidentiality and therefore will not publish it.  The report is available to members but is not being published.  I ask members not to publish or circulate it by any other means.  We will note the item for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1519290000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Do we have any idea of the timelines for the High Court cases that have been mentioned?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#B00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1519290000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>No.  We could not know that at this stage, in fairness. <\/p> <p>No. 1087, is a letter from Mr. John O'Sullivan, who is the chief executive and commissioner of valuation.

I have marked item No. 8 on the correspondence in question and I want to raise it now.  We asked her for a written explanatory note on how the figure for temporary rehabilitation remuneration is calculated.  I was keen to know how they calculate this figure when people are out for extended periods on temporary remuneration for rehabilitation purposes.  She wrote back to say that regulation 6 \"provides that the rate of pay of temporary rehabilitation remuneration is the same as the rate of pension that the individual would be paid if they were to be ill-health retired\".  In other words, I asked her how her office calculates this and she wrote to say that it calculates it in the same way that it calculates something else.  We will have to go back to ask her to give us a specific information note on how this figure is calculated.  It is not enough to say it is calculated in the same way as something else if we do not know how the something else is calculated either.

It is up to policymakers to set down what changes should be made and not Deloitte.  I have no difficulty with Deloitte publishing a report setting out the problems.  I have a difficulty if the university and the HEA are suggesting that the recommendations to fix problems will come from Deloitte.  I do not accept that at all.

I have met some of the workers and unions involved on this outside of my work on this committee.  I am sure other members have as well.  This is something the unions raised with me.  The Pensions Authority was informed on 4 September 2009 that the scheme was no longer in compliance with the statutory funding standard as set out in Part 5 of the Pensions Act.<\/p> <p>  In the wake of the financial crisis the authority adopted a general policy of allowing schemes extra time to enter into a funding proposal, which they were required to do.  Has the Pensions Authority the right to override what is a statutory instrument?  That is what seems to have happened here.  A separate briefing document, prepared for CI&Eacute; and released under an FOI request, was given to the secretariat.  It is not in the pack for this week.  I think it was sent yesterday.  It refers to CI&Eacute; pensions and superannuation schemes.  One paragraph refers to the board's responsibilities as set out in the statutory base rules.  It goes on to say that independent legal advice would suggest it would be difficult for the board to ignore the advice recommended by the authority, unless there was some compelling reason to believe that the authority's recommendation was flawed.  There is no reason to believe the data on which the valuation is based is incorrect.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions.  Does the authority have the right to override what is a statutory instrument?  The second and bigger issue is one the unions are asking us to try to establish.  Is there a policy in CI&Eacute; to engage in deliberately underfunding the defined pension scheme in an effort to make it insolvent at some point?

Correspondence No. 1092C from an individual dated 16 February regarding the sale of land by the congregation of Christian Brothers at Clonkeen College in Blackrock in County Dublin.  The individual wrote to the committee regarding this matter last year.  We sent the response from the Department of Education and Skills to the individual.  The person has now asked the committee to look at the role of the Department of Education and Skills arising from its failure to safeguard fully the State's investment in schools that were built on land owned by third parties, and in particular on lands owned by religious orders.<\/p> <p>  This may be an interesting point.  I propose we write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for an information note on the models used to protect capital investment by the State on land owned by private or charity entities.  This has far reaching effects, with the State investing money in lands not in its ownership.  A local authority would not build a house on land it did not have the title deeds to.  We want to get a note from Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on that.  We will come back to that broad issue.  Agreed.  <\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence 1093 from Deputy Alan Kelly suggesting amendments to our working document in relation to our report.

The chapter is on corporation tax.  It is important that members of the public remember that corporation tax accounted for 15% of total tax receipts in 2016.  This tax has displayed considerable volatility in recent years.  Some 70% of all corporation tax is paid by the top 100 companies, and 37% by just ten companies.  Such a concentration represents a serious risk to the Exchequer and the payment for public services in the years ahead.  The committee wishes to understand fully this risk and how it might best be dealt with.<\/p><p>The area of corporation tax in a global economy is complex and poorly understood by many people.  Dr. Brian Keegan, director of public policy on taxation with Chartered Accountants Ireland, was contracted by the committee to provide a briefing to it to develop its understanding.  In our first session last week, in private session, he gave us a briefing.  We are here today to provide that briefing in public session for the benefit of the public who want to follow the discussion.  He is accompanied today by Ms Norah Collender, also from the institute.  In the afternoon, we will have further engagement with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance to bring our consideration of this matter to a conclusion for now.<\/p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

Members will have received our briefing document on corporation tax.  I am happy to provide any further explanations and whatever clarifications I can in the course of the meeting this morning.  I am joined today by my colleague Ms Norah Collender.<\/p> <p>  Any charge to tax on companies in Ireland hinges on the concept of residence.  All developed countries operate residence rules by virtue of the place of incorporation, or the place of management and control, or a hybrid arrangement.  In Ireland, the charge to corporation tax is, first and foremost, based on the place of incorporation.  A company incorporated here is tax resident here.  <\/p> <p>  In Ireland, the headline corporation tax rate is 12.5%, but other rates also apply to companies.  Investment or passive income is taxed at a rate of 25%.  Capital gains &mdash; namely profits arising from the sale of a capital asset, such as land or buildings &mdash; are taxed at 33%.  Many companies are subject to further surcharges on profits, and these companies are known as close companies.  The majority of companies in Ireland are close.  Close companies are defined as companies that are owned and controlled by a small group of people; often they are family ventures.<\/p> <p>  The Irish tax system operates to ensure that, all else being equal, it is more costly in tax terms for a business to operate through a company compared to operating the business through sole ownership, even though the prevailing company rate of 12.5% is far lower than the top rate of income tax, 40%, plus USC and PRSI.  That is because money leaving the company is taxed under the income tax regime while money remaining in the company is taxed under the corporation tax regime and then potentially surchargeable at a rate up to 20%.<\/p> <p>  One of the consequences of the close company legislation is that relatively few companies in Ireland pay corporation tax, and those that do pay small amounts.  Most corporation tax is typically paid by non-close companies, that is, publicly quoted companies or multinationals.<\/p> <p>  There are other special classes of company that feature in the Irish tax system.  For example, real estate investment trusts allow investors purchase shares in investment property while taxing the returns as if the investors had directly bought the investment property and rented it themselves.  Charities are subject to an exemption from mainstream taxes.  A section 110 company is a particular type of company used to facilitate asset management in the International Financial Services Centre.<\/p> <p>  There are also particular tax regimes that can apply depending on the nature of the company's activities.  Incentives exist for investments in intellectual property, for the development of intellectual property through research and development, and for the exploitation of intellectual property recognised under the knowledge development box rules.  We have provided an outline of the rules applying to these special classes of companies and incentives in the briefing document.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Corporation Tax system also works within a framework of international agreements and conventions, not least our undertakings by virtue of our membership of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  No taxes can be modified by the European Union without unanimous agreement among the 28 EU member states.  In terms of corporation tax specifically, there exists a number of EU directives to ensure that, within the confines of EU member state borders, no double taxation accrues when EU-based companies pay each other dividends, royalties or interest, nor should there be a tax penalty when companies seek to merge their businesses across EU member state borders.<\/p> <p>  The EU treaties also provide for the safeguarding of four fundamental freedoms &ndash; the freedoms of movement of people, goods, services and capital.  All Irish law, not just corporation tax law, must be compliant with these principles.  Under the state aid rule, no country can grant a selective advantage to a company or to a sector of which other companies or sectors cannot avail.  <\/p> <p>  Beyond EU membership arrangements, Ireland is also party to more than 70 bilateral double taxation treaties, which attempt to ensure that a company cannot be taxed twice in two different jurisdictions on the same profits.  These relieving measures are mainly policed by systems of withholding taxation.  <\/p> <p>  To conclude these opening comments, we were asked to describe the discretion available to the Revenue Commissioners in the pursuit of their responsibilities under the taxes Acts.  In so far as Revenue officers have any discretion available to them, that discretion is circumscribed by the legislation.  We have described in the briefing note the main circumstances in which discretion or judgment might be applied.  I would be happy to expand on these further and, indeed, on any aspect of the briefing note.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1519290000,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Keegan.

I am interested in the section on transfer pricing.  That comes out of the report, Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Code, by Mr. Seamus Coffey.  If transfer pricing were to be extended to non-trading transactions that would include transfer pricing examination of matters such as renting property, how would that apply in respect of real estate investment trusts, REITs?  The witness has described withholding tax to us and the tax being liable.<\/p> <p>  I will put an example.  If 80% of shareholders were in one of the other European countries, essentially the tax liability, with the exception of the withholding tax liability, is in the country of their origin.  Would this recommendation in the Coffey report have any bearing on where the tax liability might fall?  We are seeing, in effect, property become mobile for the first time.  The understanding was that property was the one thing that could be taxed in one location and was not mobile.

The Deputy's conclusion, \"if at all\", is probably the answer.  When we speak of transfer pricing, we are normally speaking about transactions between connected companies, most often those under common ownership.  A REIT is by definition a kind of stand-alone management arrangement for a particular property or group of properties.  Transfer pricing arrangements might conceivably apply if two REITs were in common ownership in different jurisdictions.  I am not aware if that is a common structure.

Whether that would be permissible under EU rules which ensure no one sector can be favoured over another is a question that would really have to be teased out.  Having said that, there are procedures, and Ireland does this all the time, whereby we approach the European Union, say we are proposing to do this in our tax legislation and ask whether it is acceptable under state aid rules.

It relates, fundamentally, to the number of shareholders, that is, five or fewer.  The idea behind a close company is to ensure that individuals do not put their businesses through as a company and avail of a 12.5% rate instead of a 40% rate.  The laws are almost penal and are designed to ensure that if someone is incorporating a business in Ireland, he or she has to have very good commercial reasons to use a company structure and should not be doing so for tax purposes.  There are special rules to do with leaving moneys in the company whereby if they are not distributed out, they are surcharged.  There are special rules on how much money a director or shareholder can take out of the company without a tax penalty and so on.  The combined effect of all those rules is that it is much more efficient for close companies to pay out their profits by way of salaries to the participators.  Therefore, those profits, which one might expect to be taxed under corporation tax rules, are actually taxed under the income tax rules because they are paid out by way of salary or ultimately, by way of dividend.  That happens because it is tax inefficient to do otherwise because the tax system is designed to ensure it is inefficient to do otherwise.  The consequence of that is that the bulk of corporation tax is paid by more widely held companies which typically, by definition, are bigger companies.  They tend to be multinationals and they tend to be publicly quoted.  Due to the nature of the economic environment in which we all find ourselves, an increasing amount of the value and profitability of the corporate sector is derived from intellectual property.  By contrast, 100 years ago the profitability of the corporate sector was mainly derived from the holding of natural resources.  Things have moved on and it is those industries which have a very high reliance on intellectual property, like the pharmaceutical and ITC sectors, that are making the big money now.  It is a by-product of economic factors on the one hand and the particular structure in Ireland on the other.  The Irish structure is pretty unique in terms of how it actually penalises individuals.  The UK started off with a similar set of arrangements in the 1970s, which have been very much watered down since, but we have retained the strict close company regime and that is a big factor in explaining why there are relatively few companies paying corporation tax.  It is not that tax is not being paid or that Irish companies are not making profits but that the tax on those profits tends to be collected through the income tax as distinct from the corporate tax system.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#J03400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Keegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519290000,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Most tax comes from the PAYE system-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#K00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519290000,"counter":293,"content":"<p>That is right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1519290000,"counter":294,"content":"<p>----- and within the PAYE system, close companies pay tax through salaries that are taxed.

One of the reliefs, to which Deputy Catherine Murphy alluded earlier, is based on losses being carried forward.  Where a business has incurred losses in previous years, it can carry those losses forward and offset them against the taxable profits in the current period or a future period.  That is certainly a contributing factor.  There are also provisions whereby if a company engages in capital investment like buying new plant or machinery or intellectual property - things like copyrights, patents, trademarks and so forth - it can use the money expended on those capital assets to reduce the amount of profit that is subject to tax.  That is above the line, so to speak, and one comes up with the taxable figure and tax is charged at 12.5% or 25%, as appropriate.  However, below-the-line credits can arise, mainly in two areas.  They can arise in terms of the indigenous tax credit for research and development, which is a huge factor in the Irish tax system.  It is very much tied up with the notion of intellectual property and therefore, by definition, it is tied up with those companies which tend to make the most money because of their economic structure.  We also operate a system of tax credits whereby if holding companies in Ireland are receiving a dividend from abroad, a credit attaches to those dividends by virtue of foreign tax paid by foreign subsidiaries, for example.  That would reduce the overall effective rate.<\/p> <p>  There are factors above the line that reduce the actual taxable profit and there are factors below the line which, after the tax is calculated, reduce the amount of tax payable.

It would be quite useful to hear about the changes that were made in the UK with regard to smaller companies.  Usually when there is a newspaper headline relating to corporate tax, the response is that a small number of companies pay the vast majority of corporate tax and that is actually the case.  However, Dr. Keegan has drawn a distinction between close companies and how their tax is treated and other companies.  In actual fact, we are not comparing like with like.  We are not talking about 107,000 companies being liable for corporate tax - only a portion of those companies are liable.  Dr. Keegan also described the tax treatment of close companies as \"penal\".  It could be viewed as an inhibitor in terms of Irish companies growing if we cannot apportion tax in a fair way and if some groups of companies are enjoying a disproportionately advantageous tax treatment in comparison with others.  Smaller or close companies appear to have a bigger hill to climb.  What changes did they make in the UK?

In very basic terms, the UK replaced its close company legislation with a procedure known as IR35.  That procedure allows Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to look through the corporate structure and tax the individuals as if the earnings of the company had arisen directly to themselves.  It is a much more convoluted structure.  The great advantage of our close company regime is that it is well defined and well understood.  When I say \"penal\", I should clarify what I mean.  If one is trying to game the system and trying to use the corporate structure to have profits taxed at 12.5% instead of at the income tax rate, one will get caught.  It is for that reason that Irish business owners are careful to ensure that those rules are not triggered and that money is paid out and accounted for through the income tax system.  The net effect is probably the same but the revenue authorities in the UK found they had to impose the IR35 mechanism to effectively undo the undoing that they had done on their close company regime.

For example, there used to be a system known as free depreciation whereby if a company bought an asset, it could write the full cost of that asset straight off against its tax liability.

If one is an employee, one is engaged by an employer to provide under a contract for services.  An employee also has all kinds of entitlements under the employment and labour laws and protections that exist within the State's ambit.  If one is providing a contract of services, for example, if one is trying to operate through a company, then one no longer has those kinds of protection.  That is one aspect of it.<\/p> <p>  I will use a simple example to show how it works in practice.  Let us say that I was to incorporate my business and that, instead of invoicing as Brian Keegan, I invoiced as Brian Keegan Limited.  It would simply be a matter for me of putting the work through the company.  The company would keep its own books and records.  Invoices would be issued from Brian Keegan Limited and that money would belong to Brian Keegan Limited.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, I would be paid a salary by the company.  In so far as the profits of the company were not extinguished from the salary, those profits would be liable to tax at 12.5%.  The wrinkle, which links with the previous questions on close company rules, is that, if I leave the money that was taxed at 12.5% in the company, it becomes liable to a surcharge of 20% after 18 months.  For me to avoid that, I would have to pay out the money I had left in the company by way of a dividend, in which case it would be immediately taxable under the income tax rules.  These are all of the wrinkles.<\/p> <p>  As I said in private session, when I am asked by individuals from time to time whether it is worth their while to incorporate, I always tell them not to do it for tax purposes.  If there is a commercial reason for doing it, for example, if they need the protection of limited liability, then by all means they should do it, but they should not do it for tax reasons because there is no tax advantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#M01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1519290000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Next is Deputy Murphy.

He has given us a summary note on the Coffey review, which was carried out by Seamus Coffey.  For the record, I understand Mr. Coffey made a presentation some time ago to the finance committee so I did not invite him here today to repeat what he has already said in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  What he said is reported on the record.  He makes a number of recommendations in the review, and we as a committee will take note of pages 42, 43 and 44 of Dr. Keegan's briefing relating to this.  We will not restate the recommendations.  They are already on the public record.  Mr. Coffey essentially highlights the risk to the taxpayer of over-reliance on this and talks about intellectual property, base erosion and profit shifting and transfer pricing.  Dr. Keegan's summary note on this is helpful to us.<\/p> <p>  I turn to page 45.  I refer to the issue of tax residency in the second paragraph.  I think I asked Dr. Keegan about this on the previous occasion while the committee was in private session.  An individual's tax residence can be primarily determined by their physical presence.  Generally an individual is considered to be resident for tax purposes in Ireland if they spend 183 days or more in Ireland in any one year.  That is six months.  I cite the example of someone who spends four months in one country, four months in another country and four months somewhere else.  He or she is not resident for tax purposes anywhere.  I know Dr. Keegan will say he or she pays tax on the income generated in each of those areas, but a clever person could have the majority of his or her income somewhere else and not be tax resident anywhere.  That can happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#O02100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519290000,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I cannot think of a reason it might not.

In parallel, agreement was reached shortly after we last met the company in terms of the framework.  That was approved by the company at board level and by Government in January.  Our minds have been concentrated in recent weeks in supporting the NTMA in terms of its procurement process.  We are at the stage now where we thought we would be, that is to say, the process for the appointment of the custodian agent to receive the funds is almost complete.  We have entered the standstill period, which runs for up to 14 days.  We expect to make an announcement shortly on the identification of the agent that will manage the moneys for us.<\/p> <p>  In parallel, there is a process of procuring the services of investment managers.  We expect this process, which is rather advanced, will be completed through the course of early March.  Once we have contracts signed, all of that will allow for the custodian to put the accounts in place to capture the money and for the investment managers to be active in managing the money.

The frustration is that even though the 12.5% is generous, in some cases only a tiny proportion of that ends up being paid.<\/p> <p>  We are told that research and development is the main area against which tax can be set aside.  I imagine that there is a limited amount of research and development that can be put into financial and insurance activities.  However, one could lose a fortune in pharmaceutical manufacturing because there is ongoing development of new drugs which we are told is very expensive.  Is there a bit of a conundrum in that we are giving very generous research and development write-offs for, for example, the pharmaceutical sector, when we have some of the most expensive drugs in the world.  Does that get factored into the approach to research and development in that particular sector, for example?  I do not think it is possible to say it is the same with other sectors.

I think it was evaluated in 2016.  I will confirm with Mr. Hession if that is correct.  From our assessment of the effect of the overall tax credit, we were seeing 60% additionality in terms of research and development activity in the State as a result of the availability of the credit.  When that is considered in terms of industrial policy, we are complementing where we would like to see our economy going, which is creating high value and well paid employment opportunities for young educated people who are coming from our universities and so on.<\/p><p> To draw the thread from the individual research and development tax credit right down to the pricing policy is quite difficult, however.  Even at that, its benefit is that it is a general measure available across the economy, depending on the level of research and development activity undertaken.

It is a big set aside.  Yet, at the same time, on the other end, we do not get any advantage.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to another area that we explored.  It relates to real estate investment trusts, REITs.  Last week we explored this with the tax consultant who has been assisting us.  For example, in the case of a real estate investment trust, we are told the only real tax that is paid is paid by the company that is managing it, although it is not the only tax.  Most of the tax liability will be on the shareholders, that is, the people who own the shares.  If they are 90% in France, they pay 20% withholding tax here and are liable for the tax, with the 20% discounted, in France.  I use that as an example.<\/p> <p>  We are now moving into a situation where property has become mobile whereas it had been a thing one could guarantee was fixed.  How does that relate to people who own property here and would be liable to pay tax on it here, for example?  Is the way this is handled encouraging a different type of ownership?  Many of these might have bought assets cheaply and may well be competing in an entirely different way with people who are, say, accidental landlords in terms of their tax treatment.  Is there an evaluation or a modelling of that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#MM00500","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519290000,"counter":501,"content":"<p>The logic behind the tax treatment of REITs and other investment vehicles is that one wants to put the investor in the same position as someone who, say, just bought a house and rented it out.  With funds taxation, we are saying that there will be a double layer of tax law without some adjustment to the tax law.  This is because the fund will pay tax and then the individual will pay income tax on his or her drawdown.  In general, funds taxation in OECD countries is about stripping out what would otherwise be a double layer of taxation.  REITs are generally new builds and they have to adopt a particular model.  For example, 85% of their profit has to be paid out.  It cannot retain the profit in the fund and avoid taxation.  It has to be pumped out of the fund.  The Deputy is right that there is a 20% withholding tax and the investor will then pay income tax in the same way as the Deputy or I would pay tax on rental income from a house we had bought.<\/p> <p>  A couple of years ago a problem was brought to our attention by our colleagues in Revenue.  The use of funds in the area of property was creating a risk to the Irish tax base.  In the Irish tax system and international tax system, one always retains the taxing right to property in one's jurisdiction.  One should not let that leak out of one's base.  There was a concern that structures were available to some of the property developments and those buying distressed loans - the Deputy referred to those who were in the so-called section 110 companies - where Ireland was at risk that the tax rights to property was leaking out of our base, with consequent unfairness to other types of investors.  There was a general sense that the tax system was not designed to allow that type of leakage.<\/p> <p>  Therefore, a number of changes were made two Finance Bills ago to ensure, first, that section 110 companies could not avoid tax.  They were not allowed to sweep the profits out.  They are subject to a 25% tax rate.   They pay the investor rate rather than the lower 12.5% rate.  When it came to property, that got taxed at 25%.  In terms of other types of funds, where they had investors overseas, we took the 20% withholding tax that was on REITs and applied it to those types of funds.  They are Irish real estate funds, IREFs.  These funds have a reasonable component, that is, a 25% component, of Irish property.<\/p> <p>  The issue the Deputy raised is very germane to the tax policy debate in the last number of Finance Bills.  It is an area in which changes have been made.  We will start to see what difference it has made to the figures this year as the tax returns come in.  Given what we understand from their public information, we expect that some of them will move out of funds structures and perhaps incorporate as regular companies, which is as it should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#MM00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession"},{"type":"speech","time":1519290000,"counter":502,"content":"<p>On banks and bank debt, not that long ago we saw a newspaper headline that one of the banks which had the benefit of surviving as a consequence of citizens bailing it out was not expected to pay any tax for the next 20 years.

If I find at home a medical receipt from five years ago, as an individual taxpayer I would not be able to seek to write that off against my tax liability.  I can well understand that companies will write off debt over time, but then there is the idea that this can be indeterminate, particularly for a sector which had the benefit of the public bailing it out.

We have seen the analysis Revenue published last year of the level of losses in the system.  Overall, it is declining somewhat, but it is still very high, both in the banking sector and the corporate sector more widely.  The banks obviously are carrying massive losses.  Previously, the way that issue was approached was they were limited to only being able to offset them against half of their profits every year, but that became a problem a number of years ago when new European regulatory requirements under the capital requirements directive were introduced.  That would have meant it would have required an injection of capital from the State into the banks to correct it.  I think the policy change was made in 2014 to remove the restriction which at that stage was unique to the banking sector; other corporate sectors were not subject to it.  Instead, the banking levy was introduced.  I have to be careful not to stray into commenting on the merits of policy; I will just try to explain how the system works and why it is the way it is.  The restriction on banks' ability to offset losses against profits was removed at the time, but in order to ensure revenue was still collected from the banking sector, the banking levy was introduced.  It was due to expire in 2016 but was extended to 2020 or 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#NN00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession"},{"type":"speech","time":1519290000,"counter":505,"content":"<p>What does it bring in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#NN00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519290000,"counter":506,"content":"<p>It brings in &euro;150 million a year.

In other words, rather than wait for the tax revenue, the banks have a valuable deferred tax asset for which investors are prepared to pay now.

As Mr. Hession stated, when they were put in place, it really had to do with international securitisation; there was no risk to Irish taxation.  We would keep an eye on what was happening and would have a very close relationship with the Central Bank on an operational level, subject to the legislation in place on the exchange of information.  It was in that context that in 2015 we identified the issue of property transactions within section 110 companies.  We started a process to look at their use for Irish property transactions.  That process continued through 2015 and 2016 and led to changes in the legislation to target the amount mentioned.  As Mr. Hession stated, some of the issues are related to the level of information we receive.  Our powers in that regard were increased to ensure we had greater sight of what was going on.  That work is continuing.  It is the ongoing job of a tax administration system to constantly look at what is going on.  Sometimes it will take us a while to get our heads around what we are seeing.

I tabled two parliamentary questions on the issue in the past week or so.  I tabled one last night and one on 13 February.  I asked for a breakdown of the tax credit based on different bands of tax payment by various companies.  I got some information in one reply and more in another on the number of people involved.  It was 1,535 companies for 2015 and 1,486 companies were able to claim R&amp;D tax credit in 2016.  The range of credit available by way of reduction in tax for those between &euro;1 and &euro;50,000 was 797 people.  They were the small guys.  I have information on the companies ranging from &euro;50,000 to &euro;100,000.  The one people will be interested in is that Revenue said 13 companies were able to claim the R&amp;D tax credit where the reduction of tax was in excess of &euro;5 million in each of the 13 cases.  I asked for the figures over &euro;10 million and &euro;50 million but, understandably, Mr. Cody said he would not give that information as it might identify the taxpayer and he aggregated the numbers over &euro;5 million and that came to a total of 13 companies.<\/p> <p>  The first question related to the number of companies and the second question dealt with the amount of money.  The Minister for Finance gave me the information but I am sure Revenue had an input into the reply.  On the amount of corporation tax in respect of amounts payable over &euro;5 million, which was 13 companies, the amount involved in 2016 was &euro;440 million, which represented 65% of the total.  I think I am correct in saying that.  In total, 13 companies out 1,486, less than 1% of the companies, were able to claim research and development tax credit in the amount of &euro;450 million out of a total of &euro;674 million in 2016, which was 65% of the total.  Mr. Cody gave the figures of 80% and 40% but in reality when I look at the figures less than 1% of the companies have claimed 65% of the research tax credit on the basis that they are doing the most research.  There is a logic to it, but I still want to put the figures out there.  Part of our remit is to provide information to the public so that they can understand the corporation tax situation a little bit better.<\/p> <p>  Those companies between &euro;1 million and &euro;5 million had R&amp;D tax credit available to them of more than &euro;100 million and there were only 49 companies in that group.  Understandably, when I look at those two groups and all of the companies that were able to avail of the tax credits I work out that there are 188 companies over the four years, which gives an average of 50 companies per annum, that were able to claim &euro;1.816 billion out of a total of &euro;2.356 billion, namely 81%.  The figures I was given relate to 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.  An average of 40 companies has claimed more than 80% of the credit over the four years.  That is a quite a lot in those particular areas and I wish to highlight that.<\/p> <p>  On the top 13 companies that I mentioned that were able to get 65% of the amount in 2016, it was an average of &euro;34 million per company.  Some of them might have been just over it and others were way over it.  I estimated the average for those companies was &euro;34 million in 2016 and &euro;36 million in 2015.  I think I am correct in my interpretation of those replies to my parliamentary questions.  If that is Mr. Cody's general understanding we will not quibble over it.  I want to put that on the record because we all talk about the 1,400, the majority of which are small companies but they are getting peanuts in terms of the value of the tax credit.  I do not dispute the value I just want people to have a good understanding of those tax credits.<\/p> <p>  We wrote to Mr. Cody last weekend and we appreciate that we gave him short notice to provide a reply.  He was good, as I think he has replied to each of the six questions we asked last week.  We have the briefing note in front of us since yesterday.  Some of the replies were easy to come by as they were taken from the annual reports and others probably required a bit of extra work.  I wish to hone in on one which we have touched on already, namely, corporation tax and carrying losses forward.  Losses forward are covered in Appendix No. 7 in the documentation supplied.  The information is on screen now.  That is where companies that had incurred losses in previous years can carry the losses forward against profits in a future year to reduce their tax liability.  We have mentioned the banks already in our general discussion on this issue.  The total amount on the schedule that I have been given for companies and corporations in Ireland carrying forward losses against future tax liabilities &ndash; I ask people to wait for this figure &ndash; I think I am right when I say it - is &euro;218 billion, not million.  That is losses forward by the corporate sector to be offset against profits in future years.  We are told &euro;40 billion relates to losses that are not expected to be used because those companies might be in liquidation but they had losses forward going into liquidation.  That still leaves &euro;178 billion of losses forward in the corporate sector to be offset against future corporation tax receipts.  Mr. Cody can understand why the PAC is concerned about the receipts and potential risk to the taxpayer of that big overhang.  Obviously the biggest sector of that is the financial and insurance activities which involves &euro;124 billion, and that is the majority of the amount.<\/p> <p>  For the record, my reading of that is a fair representation.  It is important that when we are drafting a report our facts are correct.  I was staggered by the scale of the amounts involved.  It is probably not news to some of the witnesses but it is a phenomenal figure that has not perhaps been discussed in the public arena.<\/p><p>We do not expect it to be carried forward next year, with no corporation tax received.  In my letter to the witnesses, I was really asking for an age analysis of this.  How far back does this go?  Is it recent or does it go back over five, ten, 15 or 20 years?  Did the witnesses say they could not provide an age analysis and that the data is not collected in that manner?  Some of this could conceivably be very old and there might not be much prospect of recovery.  However, I would have thought that an age analysis would be available.  How much of that &euro;218 billion is from last year or from the year before?  I know some comes forward each year and is utilised each year.  I am surprised and a bit disappointed that the witnesses have not been able to provide an age analysis.  It would have helped to inform public debate on corporation tax.  I also feel it is important in light of the facts we mentioned with regard to some of the key banks in terms of the rule changes involving ECB issues and capital ratios.  The banks may not be paying corporation tax for many a year to come if there is that level of losses forward in the system.<\/p><p> Has the Department of Finance considered a sunset clause on the losses forward?  Most people have a period of time to draw down money, but the idea that these losses can be carried forward indefinitely is probably not fair to the taxpayer into the future.  It has the potential to have a significant impact. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018022200002#QQ02000","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519290000,"counter":636,"content":"<p>Not to my recollection.

That report did not make any recommendation in terms of change in the treatment of losses.  It does not surprise us that it was not a feature of the submissions that have since come in.<\/p> <p>  The issue of losses arises, of course.  It is an enormous amount.  In the analysis of the 2015 corporation tax receipts was published by Revenue, which has since been updated to show the picture for 2016, we see that there are some 8,000 companies which have worked through losses and are starting to pay corporation tax.  It is one of the factors driving the sustained increase in corporation tax receipts.  To some extent the hangover from the financial and economic crisis is starting to work its way out of the system.  We have not looked at a sunset clause in terms of the use of losses.

I am surprised that the review the Minister commissioned was solely based on the recommendations of the Coffey report and that it was so restricted, it seems, because one person did not make a recommendation on it.  I am surprised that the review conducted did not go there.  The fact that it was not in the published consultation documents probably explains why so few submissions were received.  Do the witnesses accept that there is a valid issue there?  It seems to me there is a lack of information available from the Department of Finance and from Revenue in terms of how far back this goes.  The issue has been relevant in recent debates, with the banks being allowed to carry losses forward.

The timing concerned the collapse of the economy, and there was a massive increase in losses, so we had to capture that risk to the corporation tax base.  We have figures going back.

It is extraordinary to hear of the concentration in a small number of companies of much of the &euro;200 billion in losses carried forward.  It is not good for a country the size of Ireland to have that level of losses carried forward in the hands of a small number of companies because, as has been pointed out, it would give such companies a higher takeover value.  For a company with a big corporation tax liability seeking to take over another company, a loss of hundreds of millions carried forward would probably be a more valuable asset than the takeover company itself.  Ireland is in an odd position in that regard.  We are here to discuss the level of risk this poses to the Exchequer because that is the essence of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.

The second reason, which we spoke about earlier, was that they may have claimed research and development tax credits.<\/p><p>On the foreign dividends, Ireland applies a credit system to ensure that foreign source income, including foreign dividends, is not doubly taxed.  This means that an Irish resident company in receipt of foreign dividends is chargeable to Irish tax on that income at 12.5% or 25% depending on the country from which it is paid and whether the dividends are paid out of trading profits.  Where certain criteria are met, however, a credit will be available against Irish tax in respect of any foreign withholding tax applied in the country of payment, as well as in respect of foreign tax suffered and the profits out of which the dividend has been paid.<\/p><p> We have provided a table to show what the effective rate would be if they were not entitled to the foreign tax credit.

The group comprises a significant number of Votes as follows: the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform andseveral offices under its aegis, namely, the State Laboratory, the Public Appointments Service, the National Shared Services Office and the Office of the Ombudsman.  It includes the Votes for superannuation and retired allowances and the secret service.  The remaining Vote in the group, the Vote for the Office of Public Works, is handled separately by the sub-committee.<\/p> <p>  The committee has been supplied with a very detailed briefing document by my Department&rsquo;s officials on the various Votes.  Further detailed material is contained in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2018 which was prepared by my Department and published on 14 December 2017.  It is worth noting that the total net allocation for the 2018 Department of Public Expenditure and Reform group of Votes which comprises eight distinct Votes shows a very modest increase of 2% on the 2017 allocation.  The 2018 overall net figure of &euro;520.9 million compares to a figure of &euro;510.2 million in 2017.  A difference of &euro;6.2 million is reflected in the superannuation Vote for 2018.<\/p> <p>  The structure of the Vote remains unchanged in 2018, with two strategic programmes focused on public expenditure and sectoral policy and public service management and reform.  The requested resources for each programme, in terms of staffing and funding, are set out in Part III of the Estimate.  In 2018 we are seeking a 6% increase in the gross spend under the Vote, bringing the total gross allocation to &euro;59.531 million.  The increase is required primarily for the second programme - public service management and reform - as my Department continues to roll out a comprehensive programme of reform.  It is largely related to the provision for investment in a resilient and robust technical platform from which to deliver build-to-share applications as part of the remit of the Office of Government Chief Information Officer; the provision for the funding of the Civil Service learning and development shared services project; an additional provision for the design of an administrative system to support the implementation of the single public service pension scheme and the funding of the next phase of work of the Public Service Pay Commission.<\/p> <p>  On Programme B of the Vote, public service management and reform, members will recall that I had the opportunity to discuss the next phase with the committee during my appearance last week.  Nevertheless, I once again draw members&rsquo; attention to the main points of the new framework which I launched last December.  There has been progress since the first reform programme was started in 2011 in areas which include procurement, shared services and Civil Service renewal, as well as public service reform, all of which continue to play a key role.  The key pillars are, first, delivering for the public; second, innovating for the future; and, third, developing people and the organisation.<\/p> <p>  Work continues to implement the actions included in the Civil Service renewal programme.  I published the third annual progress report last June which showed that much had been achieved under the programme of change since the plan had been initiated.  While the renewal plan was envisaged as a three-year programme of work and is being delivered on a phased basis, I see Civil Service renewal as an ongoing process.  We will continue to embed the changes across Departments and offices this year.<\/p> <p>  In addition to progress in implementing public service reform, we continue to pursue a wide-ranging reform programme aimed at delivering an open, accountable and ethical Government approach underpinned by a transparent and effective public service.  Key areas of focus are the data sharing and governance Bill; the open data strategy; and a statutory review of the operation of the Protected Disclosures Act of 2014 which will be published in the first half of 2018.<\/p> <p>  I will turn briefly to the issue of public service pay.  Last year when I briefed the committee, we were addressing the aftermath of the Labour Court's ruling on Garda pay and the undermining effect it had had on the Lansdowne Road agreement.  I outlined a two-phase process designed, first, to stabilise the Lansdowne Road agreement and then to negotiate a successor.  We have had success in following this approach.  The Government has negotiated the new agreement which is a significant achievement that will deliver the full dismantling of the financial emergency legislation in way that is affordable and that I believe is fair, but challenges remain.  The Public Service Pay Commission is examining recruitment and retention issues in the health sector.  Legacy issues associated with new entrant grades are also being examined and a report will be submitted to the Oireachtas by March.  Both issues are likely to prompt difficult discussions later in the year, but the current environment is largely stable.<\/p> <p>  As Minister with responsibility for the public service and public service reform, I am committed to ensuring we will continue to use digitisation to deliver more efficient and effective services.  Our own surveys have shown that people want to use more public services online.  We have seen a positive approach to using the digital services gateway and the public services card and MyGovID, demonstrating that the public understands the importance of having a reliable, authenticated and secure means of online verification.  We will continue this work when making services available throughout the year.  However, we also want to make sure no one who wants to transact business electronically will be left behind.  In that regard, we hope to announce some assisted digital initiatives later in the year.<\/p><p> In 2018 my Department will lead the second phase of the three-year spending review process which will take place in advance of the 2019 Estimates process.  It will build on the successful spending review in 2017 which culminated in the publication of more than 20 technical papers.  While moderate expenditure growth is planned, there continues to be many public service demands.  We must have a continual focus on the totality of spending to ensure public funds will have the maximum effect.  The intention is that the spending review process will help to broaden the Government's options in the budgetary process and assist in funding new policy measures.<\/p><p> As members will be aware, last Friday my Department published the national development plan.  The plan demonstrates the Government's commitment to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructural and investment needs.  It reflects an appropriate balance between the need for additional investment, the sustainable capacity of the economy and the need to adhere to responsible spending.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to present the Estimates.  I will be pleased to answer questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#B01100","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":840,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I never expected to utter those words.  On the question related to Brexit and cross-Border funding, I assure the Deputy that it is a major focus for me and my Department.  I will comment on the current position and what we would like to achieve in the future.  In the immediate aftermath of the referendum in the United Kingdom on leaving the European Union, my Department engaged with the British Treasury and I engaged extensively with the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB.  Our first priority has been to secure existing programmes which are worth more than &euro;500 million and will continue until 2020.  In the aftermath of the referendum on Brexit, concerns were expressed that difficulties could arise in the roll-out of the next phase of the funding plan.  We have addressed these concerns.<\/p><p>We have committed 73% of the funding available under the PEACE programme and 79 projects valued at &euro;176 million have been approved.  With regard to the INTERREG programme, the second major funding stream, we have committed 78% of the funding available under it and approved 27 projects valued at &euro;208 million.  My short-term priority was to ensure existing commitments were realised.  I am confident that the programmes in place until 2020 will be completed.  Beyond 2020, I am committed to implementing programmes to succeed the current INTERREG and PEACE programmes.  The Department is examining the legal basis for EU programmes that operate in Third Countries, in other words, those operating in non-EU countries in which the European Union has a strong interest.  I am committed to developing a means of maintaining this work.<\/p><p>The December statement on the Brexit negotiations included the following:<\/p><blockquote>Both parties will honour their commitments to the PEACE and INTERREG funding programmes under the current multi-annual financial framework.

I presume they must be made before 2020, given that preparations need to be made for these programmes well in advance of their commencement as they cannot be implemented at the last minute.  Yesterday the Committee on Budgetary Oversight met to discuss the equality budgeting process, which falls within the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

The first will be in May, when we expect a communication from the European Council on its proposals for the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework, MFF.  This is important because most of the funding used to underpin the programmes comes from the EU budget which will be determined by the new Multi-Annual Financial Framework which will have to be negotiated.  As to what we will do before and after that, my officials and I regularly engage with the Commission on what will be the precedent for implementing replacement programmes.  I have visited areas where a number of the programmes are in operation.  Some months ago, for example, I visited Derry where I observed the programmes in action.  While I was aware of some of the projects being undertaken under the PEACE and INTERREG programmes in counties Cavan and Monaghan, my support for this work was reaffirmed when I witnessed the tangible effects of the investments in addressing many of the difficulties still experienced by communities.<\/p> <p>  Funding for the equality proofing initiative is located across a variety of expenditure lines in the Department.

I have complained to the Minister previously about the absence of women in the room when his Department has been present, so I am delighted to welcome two women to the top table this morning and to acknowledge that there are other female officials in the audience as well.  There is a great deal of talent among women in the public service, but having that recognised fully in the Department of Finance has been difficult.<\/p> <p>  My second point affects both of our constituencies.  We all know that there are large numbers of young people who are either in college or have finished it and who are from ethnic minorities or have come from countries around the world to live in my constituency, which is the Minister's home area, and in his constituency, which is in many ways my home area.  I hope that the Department has a policy, through its influence on the recruitment process, to ensure that those young people, many of whom have done excellently in school and college, have a share of the opportunity to be recruited into the public service.  Some 30% of the people in various parts of Dublin are not originally from Ireland.  They or their parents came to live here.  In this light, it is time that we saw the fantastic diversity that exists in Dublin reflected in recruitment policy.  Just as it is odd not to see women present at the top table, it is equally odd not to see the diversity of Ireland.  It would be a reflection of our success story.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask about public service pay and section 39 organisations.  I am concerned about the hospice movement.  There are hospices in all of our major cities and right around the country, with several in Dublin.  There is a major hospice in Cork.  Since hospice staff members are employees of organisations governed by section 39 rules, they have been unable to access the increases that the Minister referred to in the context of the public pay restoration programme.  That programme has been long overdue and I was a part of the Government that introduced it, but I am disappointed that it does not cover the people who work in section 39 organisations, including organisations that provide vital services to persons in the broader health sector like Rehab, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Irish Hospice Association.  Unless the Minister finds a solution, at the end of the two-year period, which will be soon, there will be a 3% negative differential between the pay of a nurse who works in a hospice and one who has stayed working in a hospital, perhaps one that is close by or even on the same campus.  The same will hold true across sectors where there are health professionals, allied professions and others.  They are waiting.<\/p> <p>  There were moves to establish a process, but the Department has stated that it is unsure about who took the cuts.  Almost every nurse or doctor in those institutions took the cuts in a spirit of helping the country in its darkest hour when the finances had collapsed.  Now they find that they are being told that they cannot have the cuts reinstated.  It will pose a major difficulty to recruitment and retention.  There is a worldwide shortage of health professionals, teachers and so on.  They are getting plenty of offers from a range of countries around the world, some of which are aggressively recruiting them.  If there is a hard crash-out Brexit by the UK, the UK will recruit aggressively for almost all categories of public service staff.  Currently, those are being recruited from the wider European Union.<\/p> <p>  Has the Minister a solution to this unfair situation?  People in vital, publicly funded health and other services are not getting pay restoration.  In a relatively short time, they will have a 3% minus differential compared with other people working in the hospital next door.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#D00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":847,"content":"<p>Before I answer the Deputy's question directly, I will say a brief word about the earlier point that she put to me, as it is important to me.  She raised the question with me previously, but I was not in a position to answer it fully then.  She asked about where we were in terms of diversity in our appointees, particularly through the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  In 2017, the proportion of female appointees through PAS was 52% of all appointments.  Since discussing the matter with the Deputy, I recently spoke at an event at the Institute of Directors in Ireland where I said that this was a pace of change that I wanted to see continue.  From what I see in my Departments, we are making progress on a number of levels - by levels, I mean tiers within Departments - but when we reach certain strata, the degree of progress is not what I want.  I want to ensure that we continue making progress on this year after year.<\/p> <p>  Regarding what we are doing to respond to the new Ireland that is growing up in our primary and secondary schools, the PAS is working with NGOs that represent the range of nationalities to which the Deputy referred.  Within that, we are particularly focused on the country's Polish, Lithuanian, Romanian, Latvian and Brazilian communities.  To promote public service job opportunities across Ireland, we are moving into a space where the PAS will be targeting the awareness of jobs in those communities via social media.  We will also ensure that the same work is done to focus on our Traveller, LGBTI and disabilities communities and Irish language groups.  This important piece of work will continue within the PAS.<\/p> <p>  At a practical level, we have redesigned the various websites that our citizens may use to become aware of job opportunities to incorporate new technology to support candidates who have disabilities or use English as a foreign language.  The main reason for doing this is that the citizens who depend on these services are changing in front of our eyes.  As families grow up and kids leave school, we need public services that reflect the make-up of modern Ireland.  The community that the Deputy and I live in reflects how we can do that well.  We are going to keep at it.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question on section 39 organisations directly, we are further advanced in dealing with this matter than we were earlier in the year.  We have put together a process, which has been acknowledged by the representatives of employees in the section 39 organisations, to better understand and penetrate what has happened.<\/p><p>Even from the initial work we have done, it is showing different things happened in different organisations.  I acknowledge that it is the case that wage differentials are developing in some organisations.  We will have to reflect on what that means.  It is not the case for all organisations, however, and different organisations responded in different ways.<\/p><p> We are now on the third round of wage change in the public service.  The previous two rounds of public service wage change happened in a way that did not cause the difficulties the Deputies raised now.  We will need to get a better picture of what has happened in the section 39 organisations in their entirety.  I hope we will make progress in getting to that understanding in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#D00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":849,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his answer on diverse communities.

Obviously, there is a large African population in Ireland, as well as significant populations from different countries in Asia.<\/p><p>The previous Government moved the quota for employing people with a disability in the public service from 4% to 6%.

People are aware that many PPPs are ultimately more expensive than direct State borrowing, particularly when interest rates are low.  We have also moved into a different stage of the economy.  Will the Minister confirm that the cap on investment in PPPs for the national plan has been removed?  If so, why?  What is the Minister's targeted percentage for PPP finance?<\/p><p>I tabled a series of parliamentary questions to all Departments on the amounts committed to PPPs.  I am still waiting for an answer on discount rates and interest rates.  Working out the financial cost of a PPP is extremely difficult.  The two companies which feature largely in PPPs are Capita and Carillion.  The latter is in a state of collapse.  From reading a recent commentary in the <i>Financial Times<\/i>as to how Capita runs its own business, it is far from organised and is run in an appalling way.  In the context of the Carillion collapse and Capita's enormous difficulties, why would the Minister outsource internal audit services in a variety of Departments to Capita?  Why do that when one could use public service recruitment for the Comptroller and Auditor General's office?  The contracts are not large.  Why do particular services such as internal audit need to be outsourced?  I would have thought many people would be willing to work in the public service.  Is it the case that there is now a difficulty with recruiting people into the public service?<\/p><p>There is a slick putting together of the information and maps in the national development plan.  Kilkenny, Carlow and Wexford, however, are not on the main map for national development.  That surprised me and I am sure it surprised the Chairman even more.  Kerry is also not on the main map.  The south east and south west are significant places.  The maps are glitzy and look fantastic.  I welcome that Waterford is included.  Why are the other counties in the south east blacked out, as well as Kerry?  Will the Minister give us a more detailed explanation as to why that is the case?<\/p><p>I was the Minister for Social Protection when the public services card was initiated.  One of the reasons for developing the card was to provide a decent, respectful and humane service to people like pensioners who use public transport.  In recent times, there has been much criticism of the public services card.  However, for pensioners who use public transport, they can get on the bus with an identity card which they can use like a Leap card and with dignity and privacy.  In terms of public service delivery, that is a big gain.<\/p><p>When dealing with many people in retirement or in their 80s or 90s, one has to allow flexibility.  If they have a difficulty with some kind of a request from some unknown bureaucracy, they may find it difficult to respond.  Departments must be quite flexible in acknowledging that, as we do this transition, it is necessary to recognise people's human rights, individuality and where they are at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#E00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":850,"content":"<p>Recruitment from Asian and African communities is already in train.  The answer I gave to the Deputy referred to new groups we are now targeting.  That is new work under way in recent times on top of the work we have regarding Asian and African communities.<\/p> <p>  There is a 3% target in place across all Departments for the employment of citizens with disabilities.  My Department has exceeded that target.<\/p> <p>  I have recommended in the national development plan that the current limit of 10% on the exposure of annual Exchequer allocations for PPPs should be replaced.  I will be publishing further policy on this in the coming months.<\/p><p>I adopt a very careful attitude to the use of PPPs.  I operate on a case-by-case basis.  Any Department proposing to use PPPs to fund infrastructure has to be able to demonstrate to me and the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, that doing so would result in better value than having the Exchequer borrow the money directly.  Therefore, the context in which PPPs are now being used has changed by comparison with a number of years ago.  There are clear criteria that Departments have to meet.  I will be supporting and implementing PPPs only on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p> With regard to what the Deputy said about the outsourcing of audit services, I am not familiar with the specific service referred to but I will obtain more information on it.  I would imagine from having dealt with such matters in the past that an audit service of the kind in question would proceed to public procurement only if it related to an area of specialised auditing that was felt could best be done by an outside company or body, or if we did not have the capacity to do the work.  From my experience of dealing with this across a variety of Departments, I am aware that all Departments, including mine, and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General have very significant audit facilities in place.<\/p><p> I will have to get a copy of the particular map the Deputy is referring to.  Maps I have seen, particularly in respect of transport projects that are identified, refer to both the south east and south west.<\/p><p> With regard to the public services card, I take the Deputy's point.  It is true that the use of the card to help senior citizens to gain access to their free travel entitlements has been a real success.  As I said on a number of occasions, I expect that as the card is rolled out for new services, Departments will exercise the right amount of flexibility in making it work for individual citizens.  Later in the year, we will be announcing a number of assist initiatives to try to help in this regard.  I do not want the rolling out of the card to create a new digital divide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#E00500","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":852,"content":"<p>I have a couple of points.

It is an issue the Minister raised in his opening statement when he said he wanted open, accountable and ethical Government underpinned by a transparent and effective public system.  Everybody in the committee subscribes to that aspiration.  The Minister has direct responsibility for holding up 27 legislative measures that have been passed by the D&aacute;il or both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Some of them were passed by the D&aacute;il with the Government's support.  However, it is clear at this stage that there is now a Government policy not to provide money messages to legislative measures, including measures before this committee.  One measure, for example, is legislation I sponsored.  It was drafted by the Law Reform Commission, which knocks on the head the Taoiseach's argument that these are drafted overnight.  It is legislation the Government supports and which the Minister's predecessor in the junior capacity of that Department asked me not to bring before the committee until the summer of last year because of the Department's workload.  I agreed to do that on the basis that it would proceed.  The legislation is still not allowed to proceed because no money message has been provided.<\/p> <p>  I will outline what this legislation provides for, and this is just one example from 27 legislative measures awaiting money messages.  The Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill provides for an update of our insurance laws.  Those laws were drafted on the basis of court rulings in Britain arising from the 1630s and 1640s in terms of merchant shipping.  The Bill ensures that when one's house is struck by lightning and burns to the ground the insurance company cannot refuse to pay out as a result of it declaring that one's burglar alarm, which had nothing to do with the lightning strike on the house, was faulty or was not the type that was identified in the insurance contract.  The legislation is very sensible.  It is about balancing the scales of justice for the consumer as opposed to the large insurance company.  It also puts an onus on the insurance company to ask for information instead of being able to nullify insurance contracts because the consumer did not know what information should have been given freely and voluntarily without being requested.<\/p> <p>  There are many other measures.  The D&aacute;il has just passed what is known by the public as the jail the bankers Bill.  It will allow bankers to face up to five years in jail if they lie to the Central Bank.  That legislation was drafted by the legal division of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It was written by legal professionals on my instruction and guidance, yet it will not get a money message.  Why is the Minister's Department holding up allowing these Bills to be scrutinised on Committee Stage, which the democratic wish of the D&aacute;il?<\/p> <p>  I wish to make another point.  There would be a logical argument if some of these legislative measures caused a charge on the public purse, but the measures I mentioned do not cause a charge.  They change the law but the Department does not have to create a new budget line to implement them.  They are not about changing tax bands or introducing new motorways or the like.  They are about changing the laws to ensure better rights for consumers.  It is not a draw on the public purse.  It might be a draw on the purse of the insurance companies as perhaps they might not make as much profit.  Will the Minister explain why we are in this position two years later?  There is also a question which the committee has discussed in private session.  Why should this committee continue to facilitate Government legislation when the Minister is refusing to accept any legislation from the Opposition despite those measures being agreed by the D&aacute;il, sometimes unanimously?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#G00500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":872,"content":"<p>That is not an Estimates matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#G00600","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":873,"content":"<p>It is a matter for an effective public system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#G00700","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":874,"content":"<p>It is not an Estimates matter and I am here today to deal with the Estimates, which the Deputy will undoubtedly raise with me.

However, it is not about an individual piece of legislation.  It is relevant to this.   The reason I say it is relevant is because the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in his opening statement, talked about political reform, accountability and ethical Government.  He has introduced this topic.  There is an issue here because the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il yesterday said that unless parties sign up to the capacity review of the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser, OPLA, of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Dunning report, then the money messages will not be forthcoming.  He is taking a blanket approach in relation to this.<\/p> <p>  He is not looking at legislation on a one-to-one basis.  We have two years now of legislation before the committee, and it is not just this committee, because the Minister and his Department make the calls in respect of all of the other items of legislation.

He is the line Minister in the Department which is responsible for deciding if money messages are presented or not in respect of outstanding items of legislation.

I do not expect the Minister to be aware of it but I want him to become aware of it.  It is included in the national development plan and it is a matter of public expenditure.  On page 49 of the national development plan, it is stated, \"The following regional and local roads will be progressed over the course of the National Development Plan ... Carrigaline Western Distributor Road\".  When I was on the county council over a decade ago, we passed the Part 8 planning for that particular project.  In 2010, the project was about to collapse completely.  I intervened directly with the then Minister for Transport, Noel Dempsey, to ensure that funding would be provided to complete the compulsory purchase order, CPO, process.  Mr. Dempsey gave a commitment to provide the funding.  The Department provided 50% of the funding.  The council came up with the rest.  The land has now been secured.  Later this year, the detailed design of that particular project will be completed.  Planning is in place.  The CPO has been completed.  Detailed design will be done later this year.  Carrigaline is a town of approximately 17,000 people.  It is choking with traffic.  There is a residential development under way across the road from where I live.  Three hundred houses with planning permission are being built.  Ultimately, there will be approximately 800 houses.  The T&aacute;naiste lives in the town.  He will be well aware of this issue.  I was glad to see the project included in the national development plan, but I got a parliamentary reply from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, in which he states, \"My Department is, however, liaising with Cork County Council with a view to positioning the project for development in the post 2021 period.\"  It is all very fine for this to be in the national development plan, but the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is saying, \"Come back to me in 2022 or beyond\".  He is saying post-2021.  That is not good enough.  That project is shovel ready.  I do not expect a direct answer from the Minister.  The project is included in the national development plan.

The EU and international division deals with the development and implementation of strategies at European Union and euro area level, and internationally on economic, fiscal and financial policy formulation and the cross-departmental co-ordination of EU policy.  It manages the EU budgetary process and EU economic governance.  It also builds relationships through Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network and ensures that both I and the Department are fully apprised of EU and international developments. <\/p> <p>  A dedicated Brexit unit within the EU and international division was established in July 2016 to manage Brexit work across the Department.  This includes co-ordination of the Department&rsquo;s contribution to the overall Government response to Brexit, including input to the EU-level negotiation process and domestic preparations to ensure that our country and economy is Brexit ready, and liaison with the Central Bank of Ireland, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and other agencies as appropriate.<\/p> <p>  Several proposals for the deepening of economic and monetary union, EMU, will be discussed at the European meetings in 2018.  These relate to delivery of banking union and capital markets union, convergence in a more integrated economic and fiscal union and promotion of structural reform. <\/p> <p>  The EU and international division also manages our relationship with the International Monetary Fund, IMF, the European Central Bank, ECB, and the European Commission in the context for our former programme of financial support.  The division has responsibility for the management of membership of, and policy development relating to, the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  The European Commission is due to bring forward its proposals on the post-2020 multi-annual financial framework in May.  This will be a key challenge and priority for the Department.<\/p> <p>  During 2017 the funds, insurance, markets and pensions division made a positive contribution towards Council agreement on a range of dossiers, including the anti-money laundering directive and European market infrastructure.  The revised prospectus regulation and the fifth anti-money laundering directive were concluded in 2017.<\/p> <p>  In the area of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, CFT, we had a favourable assessment in the Financial Action Task Force, FATF, mutual evaluation in 2016-2017.  The report, published in September 2017, acknowledges the strength of our CFT systems, but includes a series of recommendations.<\/p> <p>  The first report of the cost of insurance working group was published in January 2017.  Work commenced on the cost of employer and public liability insurance, culminating on the publication of the report in January 2018.<\/p> <p>  The international financial institutions division manages Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with a number of international financial institutions.  These include the IMF, the World Bank Group, the European Investment Bank, EIB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Development Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank.  Our membership of these institutions provides Ireland with a voice at important fora on global economic and international development issues.  Most recently Ireland became a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.  The year 2017 also represented the largest ever annual financing by the European Investment Bank in Ireland.  More than &euro;1 billion of new financing was signed last year with new investments around the country. <\/p> <p>  The banking division is responsible for contributing to the development of a financial services system capable of supporting economic growth and job creation.  This involves policy areas such as the provision of credit, SME financing, consumer protection and addressing mortgage arrears.  That division focuses on supporting the needs of the SME sector.  Along with officials from that division, I have appeared before the committee to discuss matters such as the tracker mortgages.  Decisions I have made recently in that and other areas include doubling the level of compensation that the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman may award to a consumer who has been adversely affected by the action of a financial services provider.  I am now taking steps to appoint two new members to the Central Bank commission with a particular focus on consumer protection.  That process is under way.<\/p> <p>  The shareholding and financial advisory division is responsible for the management of the State&rsquo;s investments in the banking sector.  It responsible for the management of our shareholding in the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and represents my interests regarding the oversight of the agency.  A key highlight here was the successful IPO of AIB.  That unit also works on many issues relating to credit unions <\/p> <p>  The tax division manages taxation and budgetary policy.  It is responsible for analysing, drafting and preparing legislation, including the Finance Bill and the completion of the annual budget process.  As I noted in my budget speech, a key part of its work programme in the coming year will be initiating a process to consider options for the amalgamation of USC and PRSI.  I aim to have this work complete by the end of June.  I recently announced a review of the local property tax, on which the committee has been briefed.  The Finance Act 2017 provides for an exploration of other issues, such as the potential application of a tax on vacant residential property.  I consider that the objective to be met by such a tax would be to increase the supply of homes.<\/p> <p>  The economic division is responsible for developing a strategy for the Irish economy across all sectors and the economic analysis of departmental policies.<\/p> <p>  The funding allocation sought for the finance group of Votes for 2018 totals &euro;407 million, which compares with a 2017 Vote group total of &euro;389 million.  This is an increase of &euro;17.9 million or 5%.  The primary driver of this increase is the provision of a &euro;15.7 million increase for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  I will touch on that in a moment.<\/p> <p>  The gross allocation sought for the Department of Finance Vote in 2018 is &euro;42 million, of which &euro;10 million is provided for a fuel grant scheme for disabled drivers, a further &euro;950,000 is provided to fund the office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  Leaving these aside, my Department&rsquo;s allocation provides for the administrative and non-administrative costs of the Department.  The vast majority of this, some 61%, is provided to cover salaries and allowances, with a further &euro;5.3 million to cover facilities and non-pay costs.  The remaining &euro;6.9 million is provided to cover the legal, advisory and committee costs necessary to support my Department.<\/p> <p>  The allocation for Vote 8, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, is applied towards a single audit and reporting programme.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is independent of my Department and is a constitutional officer.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is responsible for controlling the release of funds for public services as approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, auditing public accounts, undertaking independent examinations and reporting the results of the work to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. <\/p> <p>  The financial audit role covers 290 sets of accounts produced by public bodies.  These bodies have financial transactions that total over &euro;200 billion.  The allocation for this Vote is &euro;7.927 million, which is an increase of 15%.<\/p> <p>  On Vote 9, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners has requested a budget allocation of &euro;357 million.  Three quarters of Revenue's budget relates to payroll.  Revenue plays a vital role in our economy by collecting taxes and duties due to the State.  These receipts underpin Government&rsquo;s capacity to fund vital services and facilities.  In 2017, Revenue collected a record &euro;50.7 billion.  It continued to support taxpayers in meeting their tax and duty obligations.  For example, 2.2 million payments were made through online Revenue services.  A key priority for Revenue is PAYE modernisation, on which work is well advanced.  The 2018 Estimates provide for an additional &euro;3 million in capital and current funding for IT developments required for the administration and smooth transition to PAYE modernisation.<\/p> <p>  Non-compliance with tax and duty obligations is an ever-present challenge.  In 2017, the Revenue yielded &euro;575 million though its audit and compliance interventions.  There were 24 criminal convictions, an increase of six on the previous year.  I have allocated an additional &euro;4 million in the 2018 Estimates for an additional 100 compliance staff.<\/p><p>Tackling tax evasion is always high on Revenue&rsquo;s agenda.  In 2017, 2,786 disclosures with a declared value of &euro;84 million.  Revenue has initiated a new inquiry to identify and pursue taxpayers engaged in offshore tax evasion and avoidance.<\/p><p> In other areas, Revenue continues to assist the Department of Finance in the formulation and implementation of tax policy.  It will support my Department in the review of the Coffey report.  In the context of Brexit, Revenue has been participating in the interdepartmental work co-ordinated by the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade. <\/p><p> On Vote 10, the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC, has a budget of &euro;1.626 million in 2018, a 1% increase on the previous year.  The significant increase in the 2018 Estimate is to provide for the TAC with the resources needed to advance its programme of modernisation and reform and to address its caseload in an efficient and effective manner, while also meeting its obligations and accountability as an independent Civil Service body.  Specifically, during 2018, as a result of the Revised Estimate, the commission hopes to recruit more staff, including tax-qualified case managers.   It will also move office during 2018 to premises which are fit for purpose, largely to allow for multiple hearings and meetings with appellants to take place in parallel.  Further expenditure by the TAC is in the area of ICT as it addresses the significant level of appeal cases.<\/p><p> I thank members for their attention and I commend the Estimates to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#O00600","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I only have a few minutes because I have to go to the D&aacute;il.  I would like to focus on the comments he made on the issue of mortgage arrears and the potential sale of 14,000 family homes and 4,000 rental accommodation units to a vulture fund by Permanent TSB.  When did the bank inform him of its decision in that regard?  Did the bank consult him on the decision?  Bank representatives have informed the committee that they have entered into confidentiality clauses with potential buyers.  Where stands the process?  Did they consult the Minister?  Does he accept that regulation is required to allow for administrative sanctions by the Central Bank if the buyer breaches the code of conduct on mortgage arrears or the Consumer Protection Code?  Does he further accept that regulation in itself is not the issue?  The issue is that the loans will be sold to entities that only have a short-term interest and more regulation will not provide additional protection to those borrowers than that which exists.  These vulture funds, which are ruthless, have no intention of renewing agreements that have been made or entering into accommodation such as split mortgages, arrears capitalisation or interest only payments and, therefore, it is likely that there will be mass evictions in some cases and repossessions in others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#P00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":1008,"content":"<p>I have not yet been consulted formally by Permanent TSB representatives regarding their intentions, though as the process moves forward, they are required to formally consult with, and inform, me regarding the magnitude of what is under way and to ask for my views on certain matters.  The regulations we have in place have played an important role in dealing with mortgage arrears and in reducing the number of non-performing loans, NPLs, throughout the economy and within banks.  However, I have indicated that I will examine the 2015 Act with a fresh eye, conscious of the change that is coming up.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the role of vulture funds, as the Deputy will be aware, the process is only in its early stages.  I am limited at the moment in terms of what I can say because of the commercial sensitivity about some of this but I am aware of the human sensitivity in respect of how people will feel if they believe their homes will be affected by this.

What additional protection will the regulation of these funds give to any of the 14,000 homeowners or the 4,000 renters whose loans will be sold to a vulture fund?  We all know that this is not the issue; the issue is selling long-term products to entities that have only a short-term interest.  That is  a serious issue and there is only one solution, which is not to sell these loans to vulture funds.  I do not deny the issue in respect of Permanent TSB's balance sheet, which has to be dealt with, but we cannot throw these families and renters to the wolves.

The number of repossessions that have occurred is low relative to expectations and to the experience in other countries.  I reiterate that I will engage in a fresh examination of the regulations.

I want to do the right thing by all but an exceptional challenge that I face on the other side of the balance sheet is that 28% of the loans in third largest bank in the State, which has deposits of &euro;17 billion and more than 2,000 staff, are impaired.  It is vital in the upcoming period that a way be found to reduce the number of NPLs that bank and other banks have if we want a safe and secure banking system.

The other insurance companies, XL Catlin, Shaw Insurance Agency, Legal and General, Beazley Insurance, Beazley Re, Royal London, Eversure Insurance and others have committed to coming to Ireland from the insurance side but they are never mentioned.  The only company that was mentioned was that Lloyds Bank did not come.  I am satisfied that we are doing well with financial services.  The conversation I had with the Central Bank of Ireland is that there are dozens, not ten or 20, but dozens of companies that are in a conversation with it.

The largest announcements I have been to include ones at YapStone in Drogheda, Pramerica in Letterkenny, Northern Trust in Limerick and MetLife in Galway.  The one of that scale in Dublin was Fidelity.  We are focusing on the regions.  Some 30% of the jobs in financial services are now outside of County Dublin and we are establishing really strong hubs around the country.  I use Letterkenny as the best example, with interaction between two very large companies, Pramerica and Optimus, and Letterkenny Institute of Technology.  Many people would not have believed that the skill sets and abilities were available in a small to medium-sized town.  Letterkenny's population is approximately 20,000.  The skill sets are there.  If there is a deficit, the institute of technology steps in.  It is very fluid and fleet of foot to try to ensure that there is not any failing with regard to skill sets or abilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018022200002#P01100","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519291800,"counter":1018,"content":"<p>Is there an estimate of the number of jobs that have been confirmed?

As I said, we are pleased with where we are.  It is important for people, which I am glad the Deputy outlined.  It is no longer about the quantum of jobs but the standard and quality of the job.  We should move up the value chain.  An example of that is Kroll Bond Rating Agency, KBRA, which is the first rating agency to decide to base itself in Ireland.  We now have rating agencies coming here too.  We now have the largest exchange-traded funds, ETF, sector in Europe.  The Deputy knows that aviation is quite strong.  We intend to focus on other areas too.  The big area I outlined in the 2018 action plan was sustainable and green finance.

We recently had a vice president of the European Commission, Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis, here and I raised this issue with him.  As the Minister of State knows, Irish borrowers continue to pay well over the European average in interest rates, including both mortgage holders and commercial borrowers.  While we have a Single Market for goods and services, we do not have a Single Market for financial services.  If we had a true Single Market, Irish customers could borrow from German banks, French banks and Italian banks and could avail of much lower interest rates.  The Commissioner indicated that the European Commission is working on the area.  It should be a priority, given that Irish borrowers are paying much more than the eurozone average.  Our Government should take a strong interest in this issue.  We would all welcome more competition in the Irish banking market but it seems unlikely that that will happen.  It is not seen as an attractive market and it is very small.  The best way to help consumers at a European level is to bring about a fully functioning Single Market for financial services.

There is really no reason, in a proper Single Market, Irish consumers should not be able to buy products from these banks.  It is an issue that we should be particularly strong on because of the high rates here.  We should be to the fore in pushing for that Single Market system to come into effect for financial services.  I take the Minister of State's point about potential downsides.  We have had Setanta Insurance and hopefully no more such incidents will occur because of the passporting in and the fact that firms only have to be regulated here for conduct of business purposes.

I expect that, at the June or July European Council and the meeting of finance Ministers across that period, we will make greater progress in putting in place the policy framework needed for the realisation of the banking union, which will ultimately lead to banks being more active outside current jurisdictions.  I will make two points in that context.  A long-term consequence of the banking crisis that we went through is the increased nationalisation of banks.  There has been a trend towards banks being refocused in their home market.  As the Deputy knows, even in an Irish setting, large banks were required in many cases to divest their presence in international markets, as was the case for Irish banks.<\/p><p>The prospects of that happening for Ireland in terms of new forms of established banks coming in are medium-term prospects.

Currently, the Tax Appeals Commission is not fit for purpose.  The Minister provided details to me in a reply to a parliamentary question.  I have it before me on my telephone &ndash; I am on aeroplane mode, Chairman.  More than &euro;1.6 billion in outstanding tax is caught up in the appeals system.  Over 3,600 appeals remain to be resolved.  The issue is that the number is growing and the problem is getting worse.  In 2017, over 1,700 new appeals came in and 252 were resolved or concluded.  The net increase in 2017 alone of 1,500 appeals is staggering.

There are over 1,000 appeals for each commissioner.  Without significant intervention this problem is not going to be resolved.  In fact, it will get far worse.  The Irish Tax Institute has raised significant concerns over this issue with the Minister and the Department.  The appeals system is an important part of our tax code and system, as the Minister is aware.  It is now open to abuse.  If a person wishes to kick an issue into the never-never, the best way to do it is to appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is giving a 1% increase in the budget in Vote 10 for 2018.  The Minister described this in his opening statement as a significant increase.  It is 1%.  That is not terribly significant, to say the least.

In 2016, the figure went to &euro;0.844 million.  The provisional out-turn for last year is &euro;1.07 million and for 2018 it will go to &euro;1.6 million.

This morning, media reports indicate that banking analysts are saying that to do anything with legislation or regulation relating to the sale of Permanent TSB loans would make it less attractive for the vultures.  That gives us a sense of the type of market we are now into.  In commentary this morning, Davy stockbrokers pointed to political opportunism and said that the loans totalling &euro;2 billion were typically owned by people who will not pay and who do not want to pay and so on &ndash; the non-payers.  The firm is saying that typically those involved are homeowners whose mortgages are in arrears and who refuse to engage.  That is what is going on in the media and in the bubble of the bankers.<\/p> <p>  I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that Permanent TSB has 14,000 homes.  AIB is lining up with some type of sale as well.  We know from the exchanges with the other banks at this committee that they too are lining up and that there will be issues for homeowners.  Permanent TSB said in its response to our initial informal approach that the bank would not be in a position to discuss the composition of the loan portfolios, criteria, levels of arrears information etc.<\/p><p>Permanent TSB has confirmed that it and prospective bidders have signed non-disclosure agreements as part of the sales process.  The point is that all of this information is in the public domain anyway, regardless of whether it is misinformation or is correct.  We intend to issue a formal invitation to Permanent TSB to appear before the committee next Tuesday.  We will discuss with the bank the make-up of these loans, the cohort of people who are in difficulties, the length of time they have been in difficulties, what they have done resolve these difficulties and so on.  This will give a greater understanding to the public, the Government and the Opposition of exactly what is going on within Permanent TSB.

In respect of the other banks and what is generally happening with the sale of SME loans, some of which involve good businesses attached to bad loans and so on, it is reported that agricultural land is now being examined by the banks relative to the loans they have issued to the farming community.  In the context of reviewing the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015, will the Minister consider insisting that the banks at least hold off on their sales until such time as the legislation is actually reviewed?  When he is reviewing that legislation, particularly in respect of homeowners, will the Minister consider expanding the mortgage-to-rent scheme?  Will he consider reconfiguring Abhaile in order that its remit is extended to mortgage resolution?  Will he consider the credit union movement and the funds it has in this respect?  Will he insist on the banks working through each and every loan they have so that we know that at the end of the process, should they have to go to a general sale, every single customer has had the opportunity to engage with the bank on the full suite of resolution mechanisms that are currently available?  When I asked one of the banks at this committee if it engaged with customers on the basis of debt for equity, for example, it said no, it did not suit it to do so.  They have not been engaged with customers.<\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il that the regulation currently in place will extend to the vulture funds.

I can only say that it is 100 times worse for those who are engaged with vulture funds.  I represent customers when they go to these funds.  One customer, as is typical of quite a lot of cases, has tried to engage since last year and the fund has not responded to any of his information requests.  It has not offered any engagement or resolution.  Any offers that have been made in other cases come back with the same answer, that it is not good enough and it wants more money.

Going back to a comment I made earlier, I am very conscious of the worry that is encompassed in that figure of non-performing loans.  However, we need a stable, secure and successful Permanent TSB in Ireland.  On the one hand, we have a direction that has been issued from an independent central bank that is regulating this bank and whose regulation the bank is required to meet.  There is a level of bad loans that is five times the eurozone average, despite the progress the bank has made.

I keep it under review with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to see if any changes are needed to make the scheme even more successful.  The last review of the scheme took place in February 2017, which was not too long ago.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked about the credit union movement.  It is open to any organisation to decide if it wants to acquire any of these loans, if it feels doing so would benefit its balance sheet and fit in with its business model.

I will do it against the background of saying the current legal framework in place and the institutions which have been in place to manage this very difficult issue for many years within the country have played an important role.  I cannot comment on any individual and it would not be appropriate for me to do so.  Of course, we are all aware of citizens who have reached resolutions with their banks and agreements which have led to a significant decrease in mortgage arrears on non-performing loans.  I have many colleagues, including Deputies Peter Burke and Bernard J. Durkan, who have been raising the matter with me and will look at further change if it is needed and how and when I can do it.  Of course, I want to do it as soon as I can, but I do not want to lose sight of the fact that the framework we have had in place has enabled a resolution for many citizens of banking difficulties which, a number of years ago, had looked nearly insurmountable.

It appears from that circumstance that the scales are tilted in favour of the institutions and the vulture funds in this case.

I am querying this with the regulator but there is unease in the market, not just in cases of road insurance but with public liability and employers' liability insurance.

On average, motor insurance premia are down by 16% year on year.  There has been an increase of 57% from the low point, but that was when there was a price war and the outcome of price wars never tends to be good.  We are not going to see decreases of 57%.  The employer liability and public liability reports were done, they went to Cabinet and they have been published.  A lot of work has been done, some of it following the recommendations of the motor insurance report of 12 months earlier.  The Personal Injuries Commission has been established and Mr. Justice Kearns has produced its first report.  He is working on a second part, which will be very telling as it will cross-reference payments in the Irish system with those in our nearest neighbour, and maybe some other jurisdictions.  It will compare what people get from similar claims in the UK to what they get in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  One line sticks out from the employer liability and public liability reports, which asserts that one cannot have low premia and high awards.  We have high awards and that is what we are trying to deal with.

There are a number of aspects to this.  The general data protection regulation is to start in May.  A recommendation on employers' land public liability insurance will be that, if somebody has a claim, that he or she must present it within 28 days, the period for which somebody can hold information.  If there is a video camera recording an event or potential accident, somebody has to present the claim to the individual within the period, otherwise the data have to be deleted.
