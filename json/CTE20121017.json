Fleming who is the principal officer based in Tubbercurry with responsibility for RSS, T&uacute;s and CSP; and Mr. John Lee, who is assistant principal reporting to Ms Donnelly on community employment and is one of our accountants.<\/p><p>  The committee has invited us here to discuss how unemployment can be minimised and the roles community employment and the other schemes can play in supporting people in getting back to work.  Pathways to Work sets out to improve how the State engages with and supports the unemployed to get back into the workforce.  It is being delivered alongside the measures in the Government&rsquo;s action plan on jobs to help create new employment opportunities.  The approach set out in Pathways to Work is designed to build on existing Government policies to ensure that as many new job opportunities as possible are filled by those on the live register.  The challenge in Pathways to Work is to ensure that the creation of new jobs results in a reduction in unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment so that individuals do not become permanently disenfranchised within our society.<\/p><p>  The Department of Social Protection is engaged with the delivery of income support payments, activation of those of working age and the control of fraud and abuse of the system.  On activation, the aim of the Department is to engage with every unemployed individual to ensure that his or her first day out of work is also the first step on the pathway back to work.  Future funding of employment programmes, particularly community employment, will reinforce the key objectives required by the Department as outlined earlier.  This requires a more focused engagement with people on programmes such as CE and greater targeting of activation places and opportunities to further the progression of unemployed people into work.<\/p><p>  Community employment is one of a number of employment schemes managed by the Department of Social Protection.  Other smaller programmes that are similar in many respects to community employment are the rural social scheme, the community services programme, job initiative and T&uacute;s.  Members of the committee have been furnished with a copy of the financial review of CE schemes.  Therefore, I will not go into the background and the main features of CE in detail although I am very happy to take questions on the review.  I will, however, point to a number of key areas that I feel are pertinent to the committee.  In addition, I will make reference to the other schemes already mentioned.<\/p><p>  Over the years CE has become a vital service to communities in remote rural areas and areas of urban disadvantage.  It has developed into a somewhat unique programme that integrates employment interventions and training for the individual with community services.  It is the largest labour market activation programme in Ireland.  The 2012 budget for CE is approximately &euro;340 million and the programme has 23,300 places, including approximately 1,400 supervisors.  Some 1,136 CE schemes throughout the country provide a wide range of social services to local communities.<\/p><p>  A key function of CE is supporting social inclusion and counteracting the drift into long-term unemployment.  The programme is targeted in the main at people over 25 who are long-term unemployed and very distant from the labour market.  Participants on CE are in receipt of specified social welfare payments for a minimum period of one year and include people on the live register, lone parents and people with a disability.  Within these categories there are participants associated with long-term disadvantage such as ex-offenders, people with drug dependency and people from the Traveller community.  CE is a broad and flexible programme that has been utilised to address many social challenges presenting at individual or societal level such as rehabilitative programmes and supporting communities in the provision of services.<\/p><p>  Many new entrants to CE come from a background of educational disadvantage.  Just over half of new entrants to CE have a qualification of no higher than junior certificate.  Of these, one in five had only primary level education or no record of achievement.  Males on the programme tend to have lower education attainment than females.  In 2011, more than 37,000 components of learning were completed by CE participants and nearly 17,000 of these were accredited by FETAC under the national framework of qualifications as minor awards.  Approximately one quarter of CE participants are between 25 and 35 years with more than half aged 45 or older.  This programme is predominantly focused on older, low-skilled jobseekers and requires a different type of environment from other programmes - one that supports and understands the adult learner.<\/p><p>  I have said CE has had two main objectives: to help the long-term unemployed gain employment and to support organisations in providing services to communities.  This dual mandate can lead sponsors to be over-focused on the service provision sometimes to the detriment of the progression of the job seeker.  The primary focus of the Department for the CE participant is to assist them in gaining the skills and work experience to enable them to enter paid employment.  Of those who left CE in 2011, we estimate that 19% went into employment and a further 7% went onto further education.  Given the current economic environment and taking into account the profile of participants, this can be considered a relatively positive outcome.<\/p><p>  The Department is conducting a policy review of the effectiveness of its full range of employment support programmes.  The outcome of this review will help determine future policy with regard to the role and appropriate scale of many of these activation programmes.  Ultimately, of course, decisions in this area are a matter for the Minister and the Government.  The Department is committed to reforming community employment to ensure progression of the individual, support for the sponsor in the delivery of service and value for money for the State.<\/p><p>  I will now deal with some of the other smaller programmes.  The rural social scheme supplements the incomes of those engaged in small-scale farming or fishing and who are in receipt of or have an entitlement to social welfare payments.  The scheme gives participants the opportunity to engage on a part-time basis in providing services of benefit to their local communities.  There is no expectation of further progression and no training requirement other than that related to compliance issues and health and safety.  Current participation is capped at 2,600 places with 130 supervisors and a budget of approximately &euro;45.6 million.<\/p><p>  The community services programme supports the provision of services by community organisations.  Currently the programme supports approximately 2,800 employees directly and another 800 to 900 indirectly in 423 not-for-profit companies and small co-operatives.  The community companies supported are required to generate a significant level of their resources from the delivery of services by charging fees or selling goods and services.  Grant levels as a proportion of turnover in the companies vary from approximately 15% to 85%.  The 2012 budget is &euro;45.4 million.<\/p><p>  The job initiative scheme was launched in 1996 and initially provided three years' full-time employment for people who, on entry to the scheme, were 35 years of age or over, unemployed for five years or more and in receipt of social welfare payments over that period.  Further entry to the scheme was suspended in 2004 when those already on the programme were given the right to remain on the scheme indefinitely.  Its main purpose was to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for work opportunities.  This was achieved by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities.  The job initiative has 1,176 participants operating on a full-time basis with a budget of &euro;27.1 million.  <\/p><p>  T&uacute;s, which is the most recent of these initiatives, aims to provide short term, quality work opportunities for those who are unemployed and to provide certain services of benefit to communities.  The programme was announced in the budget in December 2010 and became operational in the middle of 2011.  Participants are placed with local community organisations to provide resources to maintain and improve local amenities and facilities in rural and urban communities with inputs being funded either by T&uacute;s itself or through local community fund-raising or other income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101700003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver Egan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350465000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Before inviting members to ask questions, will Mr. Egan give me a summary of the financial review?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101700004#C00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350465000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The previous budget required a reduction in the materials and training provision under the community employment scheme from approximately &euro;24 million to &euro;11 million.  This led to considerable pressure in the earlier part of the year.  As an interim measure, in the spring we guaranteed that no scheme would close while the review was ongoing.  Subsequently, our teams around the country engaged in a series of detailed meetings and reviews with various community groups.  The result was that, ultimately, additional funding was provided and the materials and training budget for this year is now approximately &euro;20.5 million.  This has addressed the issues from our perspective.  We have built in a review mechanism to allow sponsors who believed they had a difficulty in their funding position to make an appeal.  To date, about 12 appeals have been made in total and no sponsors of whom we are aware have had to cease owing to financial pressures.  That is not to say, however, that there is not a need for greater efficiency and to put greater pressures on individuals.  There is obviously pressure, but we believe the funding issue has largely been dealt with to the satisfaction of sponsors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101700004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1350465000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>From where did Mr. Egan get the extra money?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101700004#C00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350465000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>It was secured within the Vote for the Department of Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101700004#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1350465000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le Mr. Egan agus a fhoireann as ucht teacht isteach inniu.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go bhfuil an pl&eacute; seo &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh againn sula dtagann an tuairisc chun cinn.  It is important that we have this discussion, I hope, before finalisation of the policy report and that we have some input or that the views expressed today will have a bearing on what will be presented.  In a way, it is pity that it has taken this length of time, but it is important that we get the community employment scheme correct.  There has been a debate for a long time about the role of community employment.  It is good to see that there is an acknowledgement of its two roles - to help the long-term unemployed to gain employment and to support organisations in providing services for communities.  Often the second role is forgotten.  It appears that it is forgotten by some of the Department's staff who are dealing with community employment programmes and appear to be continuously harassing some of the programmes in my constituency with regard to progression and so forth.  Perhaps Mr. Egan might remind staff who are dealing with community employment programmes which are struggling with issues I will outline shortly that one of the primary roles of the scheme in many cases is to support organisations providing services for communities.<\/p><p>  I received replies to two parliamentary questions from the Minister yesterday.  Perhaps Mr. Egan might elaborate on them.  I asked that consideration be given to extending eligibility to people under 25 years of age.  The reason is the huge growth in the level of youth unemployment in recent years.  This group is not being captured by any similar scheme which can guarantee them additional employment and a work placement where they are not being exploited.<\/p><p>  In the other question I asked that consideration be given to extending the availability of extensions.  In the past the community employment scheme was available to a number of people for two and three years to ensure they could progress at the other end.  Mr. Egan states in his presentation that last year 19% entered employment and that a further 7% went into further education.  He has correctly pointed out, given the context, that this is very good.  However, it also proves the need in many cases for an additional year.  According to the reply I received yesterday, the extra year is restricted to 10%; therefore, it is not available to many people who need an extra year or even six months to complete a training course.  I urge that greater consideration be given to this aspect.  That is one of the key points to emerged from the discussions I have had with community employment groups in my constituency, in which there is a concentration of special programmes supporting child care facilities.  The budget and the timeframe, particularly in the case of child care services, do not allow people to gain the proper qualification to move on to the private sector or elsewhere.  There are two issues involved.  First, the time is not available to many of them anymore and, second, the budget cut announced earlier this year and confirmed with a slight change in the recent report is still substantial in the case of training and materials.  The alternative is T&uacute;s, for which there is no training budget.  This means that those who wish to follow a specific path of training and working in that environment have no options.<\/p><p>  I have a number of other questions, but I will leave it at that for now in order that other members can ask their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101700004#C00600","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350465000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>To put the matter in context, the labour market activation review is nearing completion.  Perhaps I might give the Deputy a flavour of the issues we are discussing, bearing in mind that we have not yet reached firm conclusions.  We hope the report will be finalised in the next number of weeks and that we can publish it thereafter.<\/p><p>  The issues we are examining in the activation review include how to make the range of programmes for which my colleagues and I have responsibility more effective in the context of labour market progression.  We are extremely conscious of doing this in a way that protects the services provided for community groups and the vital services provided.  It can be a difficult balancing act to get the mixture right and it is taking us a little time to work through it.  The way we see the community employment scheme working as we move forward is that an individual learning plan, about which my colleague, Ms Donnelly will talk, will be carried out with each individual when they join.  It will identify those people who can work through the programme and move on with one year's experience and the individuals who might need a longer term progression which we would allow to happen within the parameters of our budget line.  We are conscious of the need to cater for both sides in that regard.  As the Deputy said, there is a 10% figure.  That procedure has been in place for a number of years.  We would like to improve on it to make it more focused on the individual and help him or her to secure progression.  We are conscious of the need for continuity of service, particularly in the health care area and programmes dealing with disability, drugs and so forth, and to balance the progression of an individual against the need of the community group to continue the service.  Ms Donnelly will talk about this aspect in greater detail.<\/p><p>  We are carrying out a detailed review of child care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101700004#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver Egan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350465600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The Deputy tabled a question on those under 25 years and received a response.  There is a balance to be struck in the allocation of community employment places.  We have a large cohort of long-term unemployed people.  Community employment schemes were designed to meet the needs of the long-term unemployed.  Other programmes were designed to cater for people under 25 years.  The Department of Education and Skills has a wide range of programmes.  For example, Youthreach was designed for disadvantaged young people who missed out on education.<\/p><p>  When consideration was given to extending community employment schemes we focused on learning.  People on the scheme would undertake significant pieces of learning and get the opportunity to complete that learning while they are on the programme.  If they have completed their time on the scheme, it is important the sponsor examines whether they can continue their education through evening programmes or programmes devised by the Department of Education and Skills and provided through the VEC.  That is an option.  We are most anxious that people will be able to complete their qualifications.  The one year or three years is available for people who need considerably longer to complete their course.  The three year programme can be extended to four years in certain instances.  If the participants are engaged fully, for example if they were referred through employment services where they have identified their needs in an accurate way and that matches the needs of the individual, they already would have a portfolio of learning that needs to be completed.  That needs to be taken up by the scheme sponsor and by the community employment supervisor and implemented.<\/p><p>  I note the point made by the Deputy on the reduction in the training grant and the importance of this training for people on schemes.  We are mindful of that and the Minister has increased the allocation announced in the budget in 2012 by &euro;1.3 million.  We know that further provision is necessary and we have entered into detailed discussions with the Department of Education and Skills, in particular with the VECs on how they can provide those training and educational services to participants on community employment at no cost to the individual scheme or to the programme.  We have advanced discussions with the VEC in the Dublin region.  We are very aware that the VEC is very active in the Deputy's area in providing training and education.  The City of Dublin VEC has agreed to provide a range of programmes that are very much tailored to the needs of people on community employment, in particular literacy, numeracy, communications and child care.  We are looking to establish the primary needs of schemes in the Dublin area with a view to matching that up with what the VEC can provide.  That will be supplemented by the budget that each project has for training.<\/p><p>  On the question of child care, we have entered into detailed discussions with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Community employment is a very important support for the provision of child care services in communities.  The very clear message we are getting from the Departments of Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs is that when participants come in to take up a place on a community employment scheme it is very important that they enter into a whole programme of learning and than when they leave they have a qualification in child care that is now regarded by the sector at Fetac level 5.  It is very important that they have a given provision to undertake that learning while on the programme.  We are looking at the child care stream to see how we can make a streamlined experience for the learner on community employment so that they come in, they already have a career plan and are very clear they want to have a profession in child care. They work in a quality child care project, they get the mentoring and support from the community employment supervisor in their learning and they attend the VEC for their child care programme or some other provider.  That can be funded by the Department of Social Protection under the budget that is available or it can be funded and supported by the VEC.  We are very adamant that this is a very important development in terms of community employment.  I have had discussions with some community employment child care schemes and the county child care committees as well as officials in the Department. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101700005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Donnelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1350465600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Since the committees were reconfigured I am a member of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and am no longer a member of this committee.

It has been able to balance individual advancement with the provision of community services, which is extraordinary.  That intervention has been severely weakened in recent times.  We go down that road at our peril.  We lose out on both aspects.  We lose in terms of the delivery of community services and the advancement of the individual.  We must pull back from that.  We must recognise the value and the values of community employment in its fullness.  In that regard, I think the Department has listened too intently to the ESRI, a body which is no fan of community employment schemes.  In letters to the Minister I have been urging her to look at the work of two young academics from UCD, who have come to different conclusions about how the balances can be adhered to without damaging either community services or individual advancement.  The ESRI is quite hostile to community employment in its twin objectives.  That advice, so-called, should be cast aside.  I cannot understand that the thorough work done by the two UCD academics has not been taken on board completely.

We must not cross this mark of diminishing it and taking away some of its dynamic qualities.<\/p><p>  I had a number of meeting with the Minister and the chief executive officer of the City of Dublin VEC.

I was not always happy about some of the private providers.  It is very important that the VEC, which has a tradition of more than 100 years in the city of providing education and training, plays a role in community employment.  It is a credible body that can stand over training and education and will give a profile to the community employment schemes that offer reassurance of their quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101700005#D00500","speaker":"1031","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350466200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Can the Deputy give the committee the name of the paper by two UCD academics that he mentioned?

I am sorry for being late.  I am rushing to the Seanad.  I would like to endorse much of what Deputy Conaghan has just said.  I am hugely impressed with the very broad range of work that is being carried out under community employment schemes throughout the country.  I am from Galway.  A recent event in the Shantalla area of the city brought all of the community employment schemes in the locality together.  I thought that was very wise on their part.  One would be hugely embarrassed if one could not give them all time.  The work they are doing is incredible.  Everything is community-based, which needs to be a cornerstone of our efforts to keep our communities and our society together.  Work is taking place in areas like mental health, child care and social work.  There is a huge range of heritage work going on.  I was impressed by the commitment of the group.  Some of those who would never have bought into learning if it had not been a requirement of the scheme are now doing so.  I was also impressed by the professionalism of the co-ordinator of the scheme, who is inculcating planning and teamwork among those involved.<\/p><p>  There should be no cutbacks in community employment schemes.  I will make that point to the Minister when the Seanad debates social welfare on Thursday.  Any cuts in this area would represent a very poor economy.  It would represent a huge level of stupidity at this time, when we want people to engage with their communities.  Not only are those involved doing good work in the mental health area, but they are also improving their own mental health, which can be at risk at times of unemployment.

I would like to ask two questions about these schemes, which are minimising unemployment.  One of the officials said that the training grant has been increased by &euro;1.3 million since last year's budget.  Is that correct?  What feedback has the Department received from the groups on that?  How do they find it?  When it was broken down across the groups, did they find it adequate?  What options do individuals have when they come off these schemes after three years?  It has been pointed out that they might have an option of a fourth year in some cases.  People have to come to see me to tell me they suddenly needed anti-depressants because they had withdrawal symptoms when their schemes ran out.  I would like to hear what the officials have to say about that.  At the end of the day, this represents good financial value, based on the outputs and the added value to communities.

I will first deal with the point that was made about the level of the grant on the training side.  As I mentioned earlier, the original cutback would have been from &euro;24 million to &euro;11 million.  The funding for materials and training increased to &euro;20.5 million.  That came from a combination of national training fund moneys and Department of Social Protection resources.  Training is adequately funded this year.  We know that an under-spend will probably occur this year.  One of the unfortunate side effects of the debate that took place earlier this year was that training was deferred because there was a feeling that there would be insufficient funds.  When funds are made available later in the year, it is harder for sponsors and individuals to organise the provision of training.  We will certainly have adequate funding this year.  We will face a challenge in the future to build strategic relationships with the VECs, to link into SOLAS, to get the necessary training provided within the totality of the envelope available to the Exchequer and to ensure we are getting the best value for money.

I come from a county which has won three national awards in the Tidy Towns competition, none of which would have been achieved without the input of community employment schemes.  This year, Abbeyshrule won a national and European award.  We will have a civic reception for participants in the local community employment scheme, many of them volunteers, who helped bring the village to where it is today.  The reduction last year in the value of the materials grant for community employment caused a major outcry.  Any further cuts would have a devastating effect on community employment schemes.  I plead with the officials to ensure no further cuts are included in the upcoming budget.<\/p><p>  We must not lose sight of the fact that the sponsors of community employment schemes are volunteers who do not receive any rewards, financial or otherwise, except the support of their respective communities.  They give their time to establish and manage community employment schemes that provide major benefits to local communities.  For example, community employment has helped rejuvenate the tourism industry through improvements to heritage sites and so forth.  The rural social scheme also delivers major social benefits.  Small farmers, in particular, many of whom are isolated in their communities, are brought together and linked in to their local community. <\/p><p>  Community employment schemes and State and semi-State bodies, such as Waterways Ireland and the Office of Public Works, should link up and co-operate more.  Waterways Ireland has done extensive work on re-opening the Royal Canal from Dublin to the River Shannon.  I am fond of walking different stretches of the canal from time to time and I have noted significant deficits along the route, for example, areas where walkers must traverse soft bogland.  Under an arterial drainage scheme carried out in the mid-1960s, a large amount of spoil was taken from the River Inney and left on the river bank.  This continues to damage farmland and farmers have indicated to me that they would welcome its removal to be placed along soft areas of the canal towpaths.  Such an initiative should be considered under the rural social scheme.  It is only one of many examples of work that could be done under the scheme.<\/p><p>  Community employment schemes did not play a role in the re-opening of the canal which proved to be a major community asset.  Much more needs to be done to conserve heritage sites along the banks of the Royal Canal.  This issue should be examined to ensure heritage is placed on the map.  Local knowledge about townlands and folklore has been passed down through the generations and should be utilised.  The folklore of local areas could be collected as part of a tourism project.  I refer not only to the canals but several other areas where work of this nature could be done. <\/p><p>  As I noted, any further cuts in the value of material grants would have a devastating effect.

The supervisors of the rural social scheme - there are fewer of them as it is a smaller scheme - are employees of the local development companies.  Their role is to deliver a range of work over numerous community bodies.  It is not just a single body.  Whether employed by the sponsoring local development company in the country the work is delivered across a range of community bodies, it is not necessarily dedicated to a particular community body in that the work of a participant on the RSS can extend across a range of bodies and a range of work during the course of a year.  It also takes into account their farming activities.  For example, they may work longer hours in winter time on the rural social scheme and shorter hours during the summer.

It is a huge area and it is important that we get it right and do not further exacerbate the problems.  How are we to going to address the issue of recruitment for many child care schemes, particularly those catering for people with a disability?  A figure I was given by Citywide indicated an 84% drop in applications since the budgetary change which did away with the secondary benefits which applied to that category.  Given that the numbers applying are limited the existence of some the child care facilities are threatened.  That is a major challenge.<\/p><p>  Mr. Egan mentioned the effects of training and materials grant on schemes.  In many cases we are getting services on the cheap that should be provided by the State but that is a policy decision.  It works out at approximately &euro;1,000 per person.  The cost of a FETAC level 5 course in child care is approximately &euro;700.  That means the budget is virtually gone for the participant and one is left with only &euro;300 for a year or a year and a half.  Has consideration been given to increasing the numbers?  I realise that at the end of the day, the decision rests with the Minister.  There are 180,000 long-term unemployed people, many of whom are five or six years unemployed by the time they reach 25 years of age but there are only 23,000 places.  In a comment or a contribution it was indicated that there is a concentration on throughput rather than results, that there is a need to get as many people on to community employment as possible.  That is fine but if there are not results the only way is to hold them until the progression is guaranteed and to get more people on the scheme, which means increasing the numbers rather than a faster throughput.  I wish we had more time to debate the issue.<\/p><p>  I welcome the financial review which has much to do with the management.  For those of us who were on CE sponsor groups in the past, there are major questions in respect of the pressures on CE to get sponsors because of the additional liabilities, given that some are incorporated.

On disability, approximately 14.3% of the participants would be classified as having a disability, quite a significant cadre.  This changes around a little, but generally stays at that level.  We have complex restructuring to do on this because we are very aware of the multiplicity of outcomes from this programme and the various levels for whom it tries to provide.  We are trying to be as nuanced as we can be.  That is one of the reasons for the delay in the completion of the labour market activation review as we are trying to get the weightings of the various factors correct.<\/p><p>  With regard to the numbers on the scheme, currently there are 22,726 people on it, including supervisors.  I mention this because in the context of the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, we are conscious of a change in the constitution of those numbers.  The numbers represented by single parents would be down at 14.4%, whereas it was higher a few months ago at 20%.  The numbers are still coming through in overall terms, but the mix is changing significantly.  We are conscious of that and of the difference that makes in terms of the scheme.<\/p><p>  With regard to the social economy, Mr. Fleming works with me on the community services programme, CSP, and we think some elements of CE should be looked at within CSP.  We are conscious of the potential power within that with regard to the social economy.  We are looking at this to see what we can do within the schemes to point them in the right direction and to help community enterprise generally.  Mr. Fleming is part of the team as we work towards that.  We can give further detail on this if required.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned savings.  We stated in our report that we think we can save approximately &euro;3.5 million in a full year.  This will be achieved through obtaining better value on insurance, which we have been getting, looking at the audit requirements and seeking better value there, and looking at pooling expenditure in a more efficient way.  We have achieved considerable savings this year already and believe the potential is there for more next year.  Again, this must be nuanced and we are conscious of the need to make the rules easier to follow.  We have relaxed the necessity around different bank accounts this year to try to help sponsors in that regard.  We hope, in our ongoing discussions with sponsors and supervisors, to take on board further ideas on how to improve the situation.<\/p><p> Without getting into policy areas which have yet to be decided, next year we hope to get greater alignment between the various community schemes the team here represents, secure better outcomes for individual learners and, at the same time, maintain and, where possible, improve services to community groups.

On my right is Mr. David Connolly, community representative on the NEC of SIPTU, next is Ms Doreen O'Connor, a child care worker, Mr. Briscoe, a CE supervisor.<\/p><p>  I will give a brief overview of community employment.  It is Ireland's principal labour market programme, with the aim of enhancing the employability and mobility of the long term unemployed by providing employment opportunities for them in their communities.  It aims to facilitate them to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment.  In addition, it assists them to develop both their technical and personal skills which can be used in the workplace.  Community employment involves a part-time work placement with an employer or sponsor in a community based setting and operates in both urban and rural areas of disadvantage.  It is by far the biggest programmes of its kind in Ireland.  There are approximately 23,300 CE workers carrying out valuable work in communities all around the country.  There are currently 1,123 CE programmes in operation.  Community employment also provides a range of vital community services. <\/p><p>  Community employment is an effective means of addressing long-term unemployment by providing accessible and appropriate opportunities for employment and training.  Through participation in community employment in a supported community based environment, CE workers can regain confidence and acquire new skills to help them re-enter the active labour marker.  It also plays an important role in helping to realise equality and inclusion for many who find themselves disadvantaged.  Participation on CE is drawn from the live register and, consequently, often represents those at greater risk of marginalisation from society, work and learning.<\/p><p>  In evaluating CE, it has been noted that CE schemes have had a number of attractions for disadvantaged groups such as lone parents, including flexibility, a strong social dimension and service orientated work. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101700009#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350468600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I hope Mr. Darragh O'Connor heard what the officials from the Department of Social Protection had to say.

Can it be done within a year or does it require more time than that?  The information I have is that it is not always possible to complete a FETAC level 5 child care course in a single year or even to progress beyond that.  The use of community employment schemes as a vehicle through which people attained child care qualifications and progressed to full-time employment is not an option any more because the private sector is now demanding level 6 qualifications and it is my understanding that it is not possible to complete levels 5 and 6 in a single year.<\/p><p>  How have projects been affected by the changes relating to those on disability allowance and lone parents allowance?  I quoted figures earlier from CityWide which indicate that there has been an 84% drop in recruitment for community employment schemes.

In the presentation by Department officials they mentioned the financial review which says &euro;20.5 million was provided for training and materials this year compared with &euro;29.4 million in 2011.<\/p><p>  The issue of double payment was raised.  The feedback I get as a public representative is that most people felt the double payment was not sustainable or justifiable.  Some CE participants had larger incomes than public service employees or even their CE scheme supervisors.  The payment was unsustainable, from a budgetary point of view, and was a disincentive to people seeking work, in the public sector, for example, where they would earn much less.  This would arise for people whose families were of a certain size and had large social welfare payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101700011#K00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1350469200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation and their ongoing campaign.

There is a practical issue in areas such as drug rehabilitation and child care, where we are seeing an impact.  A high proportion of CE child care workers are lone parents and have been in receipt of those additional payments.  We are now finding that child care facilities cannot find staff to meet their ratio requirements and this is putting pressure on their existing resources.  Many of them are contemplating reducing the number of children they take on.  This reduces their income stream and leads to a vicious cycle.  Practical issues arise as a result.<\/p><p>  In drug rehabilitation projects, where 1,000 places are ring-fenced, there appears to be a huge reluctance among people who need to avail of these services to give up their disability payment and go onto a CE scheme.  People seem to be fearful that they may not resume their disability payment when they come off the CE scheme.  They have medical needs and need their disability payment.  The demand for drug rehabilitation services has not declined but schemes are finding it difficult to persuade people to join, because of the financial implications.<\/p><p>  I will ask Mr. Seamus Briscoe to say a few words about how the cuts to training and materials grants have affected CE schemes since last year's budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101700011#K01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350469200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>The cuts had a disastrous effect on training in the first seven or eight months until the reintroduction of a training budget, of sorts, amounting to approximately &euro;250 per participant.

Schemes have been very successful in sourcing literacy and further education programmes through the VEC or through the agencies that provide them.  We were successful in getting people to junior certificate and even leaving certificate standard.  It is often left to a supervisor to deduce that a person has a literacy difficulty or is dyslexic and to progress that person to the next level of education.

We know from our meeting with the Minister that it was foisted on that Department in an attempt to deal with something of the scale of 60%.  We need to acknowledge that the officials were the ones who had to deal with much of that stress.  As Mr. Briscoe said, people at local level felt under threat because the future of their jobs schemes was up in the air.  It is important to acknowledge that the officials were in a difficult position where they had to deal with everything while at the same time trying to engage with people.  I think they found that the engagement through the unions in particular helped them to work through the process.  We are not pretending it is anywhere near the end of the process but that was an important point.<\/p><p>  Mr. Darragh O'Connor referred to the community employment campaign run by SIPTU.  Many of the activists are in the Gallery to hear the evidence to this committee.  It was important that we engaged with the Government backbenchers and the Opposition parties.  Much of the change happened because of that internal pressure on the Minister from the parties.  We learned that there are many Deputies who are very connected into the work of community employment and the wider community sector and the benefits and argument for it.  We have a very informed electorate.  However, our concern now is that we have been warned by the Taoiseach and the Minister responsible that this budget will be the worst ever in their term of office.  I do not know why they keep telling us it will be the worst ever.  This creates a serious threat to the future of community employment.  We ask the committee to be aware of this issue because there is a danger that the Minister rather than the Department could decide that we should start with last year's allocation and then have the argument.  It is vital the committee ensures the Minister allocates the funding necessary for this programme into next year so that another crisis is avoided.<\/p><p> I refer to the important work by the Department officials and their presentation today.  Despite all the stress and turmoil, we now have evidence in financial terms to show what it costs to run community employment.  We have recommendations that value the service side as well as the activation side.  Coming to the end of this year and into next year, we have much more concrete evidence of the costs and the fact that the scheme is run very efficiently and has been developed over many years.<\/p><p>  Mr. Oliver Egan said there are cuts of &euro;3.5 million to be found.  It is good if they know that but it should be retained in the programme because, in fact, their own report shows there is a greater demand for training.  It is welcome that the officials who produced this report acknowledge the importance of training in the current environment.<\/p><p>  I have two further points to make.  The Minister assured us we would be involved actively with her and the officials, and this has happened.  However, we will now be facing a potentially ominous report on the activation process, in other words, labour market activation.  There seems to be a mindset and an obsession - some of it driven by the ESRI and the Forf&aacute;s report and this seems to be contaminating the troika representatives - that the only reason for community employment and other schemes is to do with activation into the labour market.  We know in this country that there is not an active labour market in this current environment.  The representatives have said new approaches need to be developed, and social economy is one such approach.  I remind the committee that when Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn was the Minister responsible for enterprise back in the 1990s, the size of community employment schemes was doubled because the infrastructure was capable of doing so.  We are not arguing it is all the one thing.  It is good to hear the Department officials saying the T&uacute;s programme should be aligned, as should the RSS, but in doing so the differences in wage scales and conditions need to be addressed without undermining or diluting the effectiveness of community employment.  The other schemes should be brought up to the same level.<\/p><p>  With reference to the double payment, there is no question that the decision to remove the payments from lone parents and those with disabilities had a major impact on people who have been recognised as among those most likely to be living in poverty.  Recent research work in UCD has shown that in the general population there is a 16% risk of poverty but it is 35% among lone parents.  The argument that they are getting an income over and above what others who are on the scheme receive misses the fundamental point.  It was not just an income, rather it was to address the circumstances of those who are lone parents or those with disabilities because their circumstances are different from the rest of the population.  It was designed to act as an incentive to ensure this participation would be of benefit to them and their children.  The case being made is reflected in the Department's report.  It states there should be tailor-made approaches to those circumstances.  For example, we support the drugs projects and child care projects.  It is not a case of one size fits all.  We argue it is vital a means is found to re-involve lone parents or those with a disability.<\/p><p>  The VEC programmes were very effective in the earlier days of the community employment scheme.  They are a vital element in providing quality training and also because they are in receipt of much of the funding that was taken away from the Department of Social Protection and was taken over by the Department of Education and Skills.  There is a strong argument for a more active involvement by the VECs.  However, in doing so, they need to talk to the local sponsors, the workers and the trade unions about their requirements in order that it is not another one-size-fits-all approach that suits the VECs.  Those are the issues I want to deal with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101700012#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Connolly"},{"type":"speech","time":1350469800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I refer to the figure of &euro;36 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101700012#L00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1350469800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>It is a question of how many schemes actually closed down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101700012#L00500","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350469800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>The Department's review contains the more accurate figures.

If we are to be able to facilitate lone parents and people with disabilities to access CE, which is the main avenue for them to partake of work or training opportunities, consideration must be given to child care provision.  I am reluctant to put an exact figure on it but some kind of additional payment would need to be made.  This would be in recognition of the fact that people are obliged to meet certain costs, such as those relating to buying lunch, paying transport costs, etc.  We would love the payment to be restored.

Last April, just over 20% of the participants on community employment schemes were lone parents.  This represents a significant drop on the previous position.  Some 16% of the participants were those with disabilities.  As Mr. Darragh O'Connor stated, we want to ensure we do not end up losing the entire concept behind community employment, namely, the benefits it has for the services sector, the individuals who partake of the scheme and the labour market, as a result of pressure arising from the scale of the unemployment problem.  Community employment is targeted at those in particular circumstances such as the long-term unemployed, lone parents and those with disabilities.  There is a belief that after being unemployed for six months, people need to be doing something and this gives rise to the pressure to which I refer.  As Deputy Connaughton said, we need to ensure community employment will be viewed not merely as the quickest way to get large numbers of people back into the labour market.<\/p><p>  I hope the thrust of the Department's presentation will be reflected in the wide range of labour market activation programmes which exist.  I hope the baby will not be thrown out with the bathwater and that it will not be a case of deciding that it is all just about how large numbers of people can be placed on community employment schemes.  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh stated, rehabilitation is no longer working in the cases of many lone parents who are drug addicts.  There has been an 84% drop in this regard, which is an extremely serious development.  Ring-fencing 1,000 places for those who are addicted to drugs was a vital element in the context of rehabilitation and really had nothing to do with CE.  We do not want to lose these.  There must be an incentive in the context of facilitating certain people with regard to CE rather than obliging them to just fit in with everyone else.

Studies show that in respect of CE, one gets the biggest bang for one's buck in areas such as child care and elder care where high skills specific training is provided.  If we are going to take this on in a serious way, then people need to be trained up to FETAC level 5 or level 6 or whatever is the industry standard.  In addition, people must be given the time to pursue and complete the relevant courses.  What is required, therefore, is access to quality training.  Such training is provided by VECs or other providers.  In such circumstances, three years is a realistic goal because not only will people have an opportunity to complete their training, but also the organisation involved will also get something out of it.  A three year period would ensure there would not be a constant churn of people through those organisations.  In other words, individuals would not leave immediately upon obtaining a qualification.  There is a need to bring some kind of stability into the workforce which relates to community organisations.  These are the key points we are trying to get across in the context of the training aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101700013#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1350470400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I asked this question because some of the schemes with which I am dealing are very frustrated that extensions are not being granted.

I welcome this earlier interaction on the 2013 expenditure allocations and on the budgetary challenges facing the Finance group of Votes.  If I may, I will begin by making some general comments on the economy, our progress under the terms of the EU-IMF programme of support and other strategic objectives set out in our strategy statement earlier this year.<\/p><p>  The economy is expanding once again and that is to be welcomed.  In April last, my Department projected GDP growth of 0.7% for this year; six months later, the indications are that a growth rate somewhere in this region will be achieved.  However, the external outlook, that is, the outlook for growth in many of our trading partners, has deteriorated over the summer.  As a small and open economy, this is not good news for us.  My Department is currently working on its latest forecast, which will be published in the coming weeks, taking account of this and other recent data.<\/p><p>  Turning briefly to the public finances, it is clear that we are moving in the right direction after a number of difficult years.  The most recent estimate of the 2011 underlying general Government deficit, that is, the deficit excluding the direct impact of State support to the banking system, is 9% of GDP.  This compares to an equivalent 2010 deficit of 10.8% of GDP.  Importantly, the 2011 deficit was well within the limit set as part of the EU-IMF programme.  All of the quantitative fiscal targets set so far as part of that programme have been achieved, most recently for the end-September Exchequer primary balance.<\/p><p>  The end-September Exchequer returns were generally positive showing robust tax revenue growth.  Indeed, tax revenues in the first nine months of the year were 1.5% ahead of our expectations with three of our &quot;big four&quot; sources of tax revenue - income tax, corporation tax and VAT - performing better than expected.  While there are spending pressures in the health and social protection, I remain confident that we can meet this year's 8.6% of GDP deficit target.  What is clear also, however, is that we continue to spend far more than we collect in revenue.  Closing this gap further in the years ahead presents a real challenge to policy-makers but we must remain steadfast in our commitment to reduce the deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2015.<\/p><p>  As the committee will be aware, the eighth review mission on the EU-IMF programme began yesterday.  We are again in the position of having met our commitments under the programme for quarter 3, that is, to the end September 2012, both in terms of policy reforms and quantitative targets.  A substantial number of actions - by our count, over 160 - have now been completed since the commencement of the programme.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the quarterly review mission is to evaluate performance against the targets set for the fourth quarter of the programme of financial support for Ireland including fiscal developments, the macroeconomic outlook, progress on commitments in the restructuring of the financial sector and structural reform.<\/p><p>  Ireland has successfully completed seven reviews of our programme to date and I am sure that the troika will once again find us to be meeting all of our targets, making real progress in restoring order to the economy and public finance, re-structuring the banking system, getting back into the markets and getting people back to work.  Ireland's strong programme implementation has been recognised by our European partners, by the IMF and by the markets<\/p><p>  Turning to our objectives within the banking and financial services sector, work is continuing across many areas.  Significant progress has been made in the Irish banking sector since the start of the EU-IMF programme, at the beginning of 2011, to our current position at October 2012.<\/p><p>  Recapitalisation of the PCAR banks - AIB, Bank of Ireland, and PTSB - and IBRC has been completed with a total cost to the State of &euro;64.1 billion.  Approximately &euro;15.5 billion was also generated through burden sharing with bond holders.  In addition, a significant sale of the State's stake in Bank of Ireland to private investors was successfully concluded.  Recapitalisation for PCAR banks was completed on time and below expected costs.  In December 2011, the European Banking Authority published a survey on European banks' levels of Core Tier 1 capital using certain stress assumptions.  In the results of the survey, the Irish banks ranked amongst the best capitalised banks in Europe.<\/p><p>  Restructuring of the Irish banking system underwent considerable transformation.  Restructuring realised the new blueprint for the banking system, with two pillar banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, and mergers between AIB and EBS, and INBS and Anglo Irish Bank.  Directors on boards of the banks have been renewed so that only one board member is <i>in situ<\/i> who was there in 2008.  All 2011 de-leveraging targets for the banks have been met.  Since the start of the programme, total covered bank de-leveraging of &euro;56.7 billion has been achieved to end of June 2012, which was a fairly significant demand.  It comprised &euro;44.6 billion at AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB together, and &euro;12.1 billion in IBRC.  Significant disposals are targeted for the second half of 2012 as part of the pillar banks' planned run down of non-core balances.<\/p><p>  The banks' funding positions have improved significantly.  Deposits in AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB have stabilised with net inflows achieved since last year while reliance on ECB funding is down on previous levels.  The banks have also achieved &euro;6.9 billion of wholesale repo funding which, together with the levels at which their senior bank bonds are trading in the market, suggests that significant progress has been made to restoring investor confidence and with it, market access.<\/p><p>  Bank guarantee support in the form of the ELG has reduced from &euro;375 billion in September 2008 to &euro;90 billion at end of June 2012.  Given that other EU member states have encountered difficulties with their banking systems Europe is now seeking new ways of breaking the link between sovereigns and their banks.<\/p><p>  A key objective for 2013 is to find the best option for a long-term financing solution for the Irish banking system and to replace promissory notes with an instrument that is more favourable to the State's finances.  In addition, it is in the interests of the State that the Irish banks continue to build on their viability to ensure the return of a vital and healthy banking system in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Much work has been undertaken in the area of mortgage arrears.  The Personal Insolvency Bill has passed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and will move to Report Stage in November.  The director designate of the insolvency service has been appointed and will oversee the creation of the vital infrastructure to underpin the legislation.  The enactment of this Bill is a key legislative priority for the Government.  The banks have been piloting resolution options through the course of Quarter 3 of this year with Central Bank oversight in advance of broader roll-out and a comprehensive advisory service has been established of the banks' own strategies to deal with those in arrears.<\/p><p>  In terms of SME credit, access to credit for viable businesses and individuals remains a key Government priority in supporting economic recovery.  The pillar banks have been set ambitious targets for sanctioning of lending into the economy.  The target for 2012 is &euro;3.5 billion and the banks are being closely monitored to ensure that they meet these targets.  The Department is also working closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to facilitate the implementation of a temporary loan guarantee scheme and a micro-finance fund.  The Credit Review Office is an important instrument in providing a valuable appeal mechanism for businesses that have had their credit applications rejected by the pillar banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700004#C00400","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350480300,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Is it agreed to publish the Minister's opening statement?

I will put questions during my initial contribution.  I am all for reform and opening up the budget process to have meaningful input by Oireachtas committees such as this into the Estimates process but I spent a few hours going through the documents forwarded to us to get my head around what we are trying to do and I find it difficult to see any meaningful basis for the numbers set out in them.  The Minister acknowledged in his opening remarks that the figures do not reflect the reality on the ground because of a number of issues.  They are prepared on a no policy change basis, they do not reflect the ongoing restructuring in the Department, and we also have the admission by the various bodies in the other Votes, such as the Comptroller and Auditor General, Revenue Commissioners and the Appeal Commissioners, that if they are required to stay within the comprehensive spending Estimates ceiling, they will not be able to their jobs effectively.  There are hard hitting comments in their contributions.<\/p><p>  On the Estimates issue generally, the Department's four Votes seem to necessitate a broad cut of approximately 3%.  There are no details as to how that will be achieved.  The Revenue Commissioners have been clear that further reductions in their budget will impact on their ability to do their job and potentially will result in a revenue loss of more than &euro;400 million.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has said if his office is subject to further cuts in line with the Estimates, it will not be able to fulfil its constitutional mandate.  I question the basis of these figures.  Perhaps the Minister can put them in layman's terms and explains the purpose of this process and how we can meaningfully engage with him and have a proper input into the Estimates as he goes forward to prepare the budget.<\/p><p>  The Minister made an extensive opening statement covering a broad range of sectors in the economy.  He referred to the fact that the economy is growing again in GDP terms at least.  It did so last year and it remains to be seen whether it will achieve the 0.7% growth target this year.  Where will growth come from over the next few years?  When will the medium-term fiscal statement be published?  I understand it is due this month.  Is the Minister looking at his Department revising the growth forecasts for 2013 and 2014 because they form the foundation of the budget he will present with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in December?<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to the issue of mortgage arrears but did not refer to the striking intervention by the Central Bank director, Fiona Muldoon, yesterday.  Does he agree with her sentiments that the banks are not doing enough and are not fulfilling their responsibilities, having been adequately recapitalised, to face up to the crisis in a comprehensive way and deal with each borrower in distress on a case-by-case basis?  Can the Minister give us a sense of the work that is ongoing in the preparation of the budget?  He must make a fiscal adjustment of at least &euro;3.5 billion.  Is he still looking at that figure in broad terms?  Will he wait on the latest economic data, right up to the November Exchequer returns, before he finalises the overall adjustment and its composition?  If he could give us a sense of the process, it would be most helpful.<\/p><p>  Given the developments in Europe and the European summit meeting later this week, when the Minister sits down to prepare next year's budget, will it be adopted on a no change basis in the context of Ireland's bank debt and the promissory note and the interest bill to service the national bill?   Will he prepare the budget on the basis that no deal will come into effect in 2013 in respect of ESM recapitalisation and a restructuring of the promissory note arrangement?  Will the Minister give us a sense of how savings will be achieved in the various Votes within the Croke Park agreement framework and the Estimates ceiling?  Given the way the process works, as the Minister indicated, there is little point going into each Vote because all we can do is examine the ceiling for the departmental allocation.  We do not know yet how that will be allocated across the respective Votes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700006#E00500","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1350480300,"counter":119,"content":"<p>The Deputy is critical of the base position but we are following the instructions of the committee in providing him with that particular set of figures.  We are, therefore, complying with its request in giving members that base data.  The concept of no policy change is how much would it cost to deliver the same service in 2013 as in 2012 if nothing changes.  That is what a no policy position means and it is the start of the Estimates process.  If there are changes, for example, when we bring in a property tax, as we said we will in the budget, the Revenue will need additional resources because it will be in charge of collecting it and a certain amount will have to be added to the Revenue Vote.  That is the way it works and it will be the same across the subheads.<\/p><p>  As to the relevance of the committee's work, this is an opening up of the process.  Members are now aware of the opening position and they can have a view before we make decisions in the Department.  If the committee decides the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General need more resources to do more value for money audits, for example, as the Deputy has been advised in the briefing notes and he says, \"Give them more money\", I will reply, \"Where am I going to get it?\"  He might also propose the alternative way of providing the resources.  This is a genuine attempt to involve the committee in policy positions before the budget is structured.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also remarked that he had many briefings from various units in the Department.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and the Revenue are independent in the exercise of their functions and they will negotiate separately on their Estimates with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Clearly, at this stage of building the budget, they are making the best case possible and taking up negotiating positions to give them the strongest leverage when they come to agree the figures.  One has to think of it as a process where people in different parts of the system are trying to get the resources they feel are necessary to achieve their objectives.  That is what is going on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700006#E00600","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1350480300,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Is that not dismissive of what they are saying?

They have gone through this in detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700006#E00700","speaker":"993","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350480900,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I am not casting any doubt on the submissions that are being made.  However, there is an ongoing process at the end of which a Department or a section of the Department gets a particular amount which may be higher and lower.  So a negotiation is going on.  The break-even point with Revenue is if the extra resources enable it to collect more than the cost of the additional resources.  That seems to be where the sum is and where the breakpoint is.  We are at the early stages of a process which will culminate with the full budget on both the expenditure and tax sides.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked me where I expect the growth in the economy.  The economy is growing and a number of sectors are growing very strongly.  As I pointed out in last year's budget, as well as complying with the conditions of the bailout programme and the memorandum of understanding, we are also running a kind of parallel programme where we are building on the strong sectors of the economy and repairing the weak sections of the economy.  Ideally growth should come throughout the economy.  The strong areas at the moment are self-evident.  Inward investment is very strong.  IDA Ireland had a record year last year and is heading for a record year again this year in terms of the value of inward investment.  Despite the bad summer, farming and the agrifood industry is doing very well.  One of the new features covered is the demand from places like China for baby food sourced in Ireland.  Some big orders are coming through to the main co-operatives and dairy companies.  Everybody knows there is great potential in the Irish farming industry, particularly in the dairy industry, when quotas are eliminated under the CAP in 2015 at which point the Irish farming community will no longer be inhibited by caps on volume and will be able to produce.<\/p><p>  The financial services sector is also quite strong and there is more activity and growth there.  In general terms goods and services on the export side are strong.  The domestic economy is what is weak.  I would hope we will see growth in that area when confidence rebuilds.  We have very high savings ratios of 14% at present.  That is historically high and quite high by international comparisons.  If that were reduced to 10%, which would still be high, that four-percentage point drop would switch to expenditure, which would add 1% per annum to GDP growth.  So there is a potential for growth in the domestic economy, but it was related to confidence.  It is also related to what the Deputy also commented on and what one of the regulators of the banks said yesterday about clearing personal debt.  The two big drags on the economy are national debt and personal debt.  If we could get solutions for both national debt and personal debt, we could take the fetters off the economy and it would drive forward.<\/p><p>  The Deputy spoke about mortgage arrears and I would share his disappointment that the plans outlined by the Government were slow to be implemented by the banks.  However, they are at it now under the monitoring of the Central Bank.  Several interventions have been pilot tested in the past quarter and are ready to go.  I hope they go with them quickly because it would help on the personal indebtedness side.  The policy is that it must proceed on a case-by-case basis.  In parallel with that the Insolvency Bill is working its way through the Houses of the Oireachtas - it is on Committee Stage now.  That will also make a major contribution.<\/p><p>  The banks were tardy in two ways.  First, they did not pay rigorous attention to arrears and was potential to collect more in arrears if they had applied themselves to it - there was a certain amount of drift.  Second, they did not make case-by-case arrangements with people who are in great difficulty and whose ability to repay mortgages is impaired.  That was what was being said yesterday by both the regulator from the bank and the Secretary General of my Department, and it is a view I share.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700007#F00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1350480900,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Does the Minister believe it would be preferable for the banks to sit down with borrowers on a case-by-case basis and agree debt write-downs as mentioned by the Secretary General yesterday if necessary outside of the insolvency system without borrowers having to go through a personal insolvency arrangement with the bank?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700007#F00300","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1350480900,"counter":124,"content":"<p>There is a hierarchy.

The second thing I would envisage is if the case-by-case attempts to solve people's problems are not successful, then the voluntary arrangement provisions of the Personal Insolvency Bill would be the next range of intervention.  In a very small minority of cases the option of bankruptcy exists because that is also provided for in the Personal Insolvency Bill.  So there is a hierarchy of interventions.  In an orderly society where the laws apply properly and the banks are active, that is the way I would see it working out.  The forecasts will be reviewed, as they always are, at the end of this month.  It is too early to say whether they will be altered.  We are not going to forecast the forecast.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about the position on the budget.  There is ongoing work on the budget.  I am trying to figure out how I will collect approximately &euro;1 billion in extra taxes this year.  The Deputy knows the basic arithmetic.  The general adjustment is &euro;3.5 billion, of which approximately &euro;1.25 billion is tax.  Of the &euro;1.25 billion, approximately &euro;290 million is a carry forward from this year.  While this is subject to small variations as we get nearer the day, the net position on the tax side is approximately &euro;950 million to our &euro;960 million - slightly less than &euro;1 billion.  On the expenditure side there is &euro;2.25 billion and there is some carryover.  There is some of it and capital reductions and I am sure the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will give the exact figure later this afternoon if the Deputy asks the question.  On my side of the house I am figuring out the best and fairest way of doing that much on the tax side that is pro-enterprise, pro-growth and pro-jobs.  On his side of the House, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will shortly be participating in bilateral meetings with individual Departments to get the necessary adjustments on expenditure to give him what he requires.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700007#F01800","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350481500,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Should the bank debt deal in respect of the budget be based on a case of \"deal or no deal\" in terms of debt servicing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700008#G00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1350481500,"counter":141,"content":"<p>We will see.

I hear the banks will throw every legal and accounting resource they can at ensuring the money we made available to them is not surrendered to mortgage holders.  The Minister stated this needs to happen.  I do not believe the domestic economy will get going until a very large proportion of this unsustainable debt has been cleared.  This will not involve restructuring or interest only arrangements, but debt surrender.  We will see what will be the effects of the personal insolvency legislation, and it can go in many different ways because the courts will have huge discretion.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners suggest they will not be able to reclaim &euro;265 million due to a lack of resources next year.  Will the Minister comment on this?  Does the Minister agree with Christine Lagarde's recent comment that the austerity-only approach we are using in Ireland is not working?  This was backed up recently by Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize-winning economist, in a speech he gave in Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700009#H00600","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1350482100,"counter":177,"content":"<p>With regard to multi-year figures, I believe three year figures are available.

The Chairman stated the banks will come before the committee shortly and the Deputy will not upset me if he presses them hard on these issues.  The Central Bank made clear its position that setting out the portfolio of interventions would be of benefit, suitable and appropriate and the Department of Finance supports this initiative by the Central Bank.  The Houses of the Oireachtas are putting in place support through the provisions of the personal insolvency legislation.  The time for excuses is over.<\/p><p>  As I stated, the Revenue Commissioners will negotiate like everybody else with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The agreement position for the Revenue Commissioners is to show that extra staff would collect at least their own salary and overheads in additional revenue.  This is the best point and is where it will fall with regard to whether it would be an extra ten or 20 people.  When the Government took decisions on the property tax it took complementary decisions to provide extra resources and staff to the Revenue Commissioners so this discrete piece of work could be carried out without any crossover effects on its existing task of collecting revenue.<\/p><p>  The Deputy stated he had a particular difficulty with regard to costing proposals.  I do not know what this difficulty was because every day of the week I clear dozens of parliamentary questions from Deputies and a very high percentage of them ask about the cost of this or that and what the yield would be from another 1%.  I send out dozens of these.  The Deputy should take it on faith that if he does not receive an accurate costing it is because there is a technical difficulty in providing a costing which we can stand over.  Deputy Michael McGrath tables many such questions, and Deputy Pearse Doherty holds the record in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700009#H00900","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350482700,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700010#J00200","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1350482700,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Sometimes, I wonder what people are up to when they ask such questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700010#J00300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1350482700,"counter":183,"content":"<p>The Minister will find out in a minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700010#J00400","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1350482700,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Mention was made of the austerity-only approach of Christine Lagarde.  There are two sides to economics, namely, supply and demand.  Recent work done by the IMF, the report of which members have seen, gave rise to a great deal of comment.  The IMF was referring to a wider range of countries than just Ireland.  The simple analysis of the IMF paper is that, if one removes &euro;1 in expenditure cuts or taxation, on average it hits GDP by 50 cent.  The multiplier under Keynesian theory is one half.  The IMF stated that it might have been wrong and that the multiplier could have been one, in other words, &euro;1 for &euro;1.  Examining the small print, though, the IMF stated that the multiplier depended on circumstances and could be anywhere from 0.9 to 1.7.  It is quite a large range.  One could examine the small print even further.  In Ireland, the multiplier seemed to be approximately 0 and there was no effect, since we were such an open economy and a certain flow of inward investment compensated for the removal of demand.<\/p><p>  It is a complex issue.  My opinion is that trying to stimulate demand in Ireland on its own is not a solution that would give strong results.  I would favour a more demand-driven approach in Europe at this point in the cycle.  It stands to reason that if all of the peripheral countries are doing budgetary corrections and the AAA rated countries like Germany, which accounts for one third of the European economy, are strong but also hold back and continue to contain expenditure, there is nothing to compensate for the demand that has been removed across Europe.<\/p><p>  Our problem is not particularly that demand at home is down.  Rather, our emerging problem is that demand in customer countries is decreasing.  Our model of success is export-led growth.  We need our customer countries to continue purchasing our goods and services.<\/p><p>  What Mr. Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank is doing is effectively a demand management initiative.  It is not quite printing money, but intervening in the bond market is a method of releasing demand. If that initiative is brought on board, it will be helpful.  The quantitative easing model used by the Federal Reserve in the US and by the Bank of England is not legally permissible for the ECB, but Mr. Draghi is quite creative and I hope that the intervention of the new French Government stressing the importance of a jobs and growth strategy will also move in that direction.<\/p><p>  I am not  that far from the Deputy's analysis but it would not be fruitful to consider the matter from the small constraints of an Irish economy.  To be effective, it must be Europe-wide and operate in parallel with fiscal correction in the stronger countries, not in substitution.  Sweden is the only country that has already picked up the baton.  Its finance Minister introduced an expansionary budget in September.  During my conversations with him, he stated that someone needed to take the lead.  He hopes that other AAA rated countries will follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700010#J00500","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1350482700,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The Minister said that inward investment, which is at record heights, compensates for the removal of demand from the domestic economy.  I put it to him that that is manifestly not the case.  Inward investment by multinational corporations is highly specialised and highly capital-intensive.  While the jobs created are of course welcome, such investment is highly capital-intensive.  The billions of euro which the Minister takes out of the pockets of ordinary people could be used for the creation of massive numbers of jobs because the domestic economy is labour-intensive.  Perhaps the Minister would further explain this.  I put it to the Minister that this is borne out by the 14,000 fewer people in work in quarter 3 than in quarter 2, the hammering of consumer spending in the first six months of this year and the fact that emigration is, unfortunately, at an all time high.  The Government's austerity agenda is a disaster.<\/p><p>  Perhaps the Minister would be more precise on the issue of the external outlook, which he said is not good news.  In my view, that is putting it mildly.  Is it not the case that the EU is effectively moving decisively into recession and that this is what is predicted even in Germany?  Against this background and that of austerity across the board, what is the prognosis for the 27 million unemployed people in the European Union, including the hundreds of thousands here who are unemployed?  The Minister will be aware from articles in the <i>Financial Times <\/i>and <i>The Wall Street Journal <\/i> that &euro;2 trillion to &euro;3 trillion in profits remain uninvested by big corporations throughout Europe and investment in the eurozone is at a 60-year low, which is a disastrous situation.<\/p><p>  In regard to the national debt, can the Minister give us the percentage GDP projected for 2011, 2012 and 2013?  Can he also tell us how much of that is due to the bank bail-out and the total interest payments in each of those years?  The Minister said that during the Irish Presidency two important issues - namely, financial regulation and continuing reform of financial services market - will require our energy and commitment.  What commitment, given that Ireland is resolutely opposed to the proposed mild reform of a financial transaction tax on speculation on the billions swashing around in the financial markets?

Given that the legislation in respect of the property tax is far more grave, will it be January or February before it is enacted?  In other words, will plenty of time be provided for consideration of it?  Also, how will stand the existing legislation in respect of the household charge following enactment of the legislation in respect of the property tax?  Will that legislation be revoked at the end of this year, or is it the intention that it will apply for the first six months of next year or until the property tax comes into force, so that the household charge will apply for the first six months and the property tax will apply in the second six months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700011#K01300","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1350483300,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Deputy Higgins is a bit of an enigma to me always.

What is being proposed in Europe, so far, is a form of stamp duty starting at 0.1% on certain transactions.  We have a stamp duty on share transactions already so we are one of the few countries in Europe with a significant financial transaction tax.  Our stamp duty is at 1%.  In the United Kingdom there is a stamp duty of 0.5% on the same type of transaction.  What is being discussed in Europe at the moment is the introduction in certain other countries of stamp duty on share transactions and possibly other transactions of 0.1% at a minimum.<\/p><p>  We are not joining that piece of enhanced co-operation because there are 33,000 people employed in financial services in Ireland.  The United Kingdom has indicated that there are no circumstances in which it will be bound by a financial transaction tax emanating from Europe.  In those circumstances there would be a transfer of jobs, particularly out of Dublin into London, if we were tied into a financial transaction tax that would extend the base along the lines being suggested by some people in Europe.  There is a strong number of dossiers on financial services coming through under the patronage of Commissioner Barnier.  When Ireland has the European Presidency, carrying that portfolio of work forward will be part of the co-operation between the chair and the Commission.<\/p><p>  We can get a schedule on the national debt, as I came here to discuss the Estimate.  We can also get the rest of the information requested by the Deputy.  On the external outlook, the Deputy would have seen various estimates, and it looks as if after the presidential election in the United States there may be a way to recovery.  There are certain signs that the US economy is recovering but that has not yet been proven.  There are certain difficulties in various other economies, including China.  The prospect internationally is not particularly optimistic at present but these kinds of positions can sometimes change very quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700012#L00500","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1350483900,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I have two questions, with the first relating to the promissory note and the second relating to mortgage arrears.

Will those shareholdings be sold with the cash flow earnings of those heavily indebted mortgages, which also have long timeframes?  Ultimately, the level of debt over a long duration will give huge profits to the people who buy the banks in their currently impaired state.  They will be a lucrative asset when the position starts to come right.<\/p><p>  I propose that there should be a moratorium on any profit making for the banks that should be stitched into any contract before the sale.

There is a concern, particularly as we approach Christmas, about jobs in the retail sector because they depend on the Christmas rush.  There is a marked measurement of sentiment that consumption drops before budget week and increases again afterwards.  In other words, people have the same amount of money at the end of November as they had at the beginning of December but they spend it far quicker after the budget.

That sounds good but let me drill into the Minister's figures.  Reducing the figure from &euro;131 million to &euro;100 million would be a saving of more than 30%.  The numbers employed in the public service during that period will have been reduced from 320,000 to 282,000 and we are well on the road to achieving that, which is a reduction of 12%.  As there is 12% fewer staff in the system, our requirement for accommodation should be reduced by 12%.  Reducing the accommodation bill of &euro;131 million by 12% would bring the figure down to &euro;116 million.  Therefore, 12% of the reduced bill for accommodation is due to a reduction in the number of public servants and the balance is due to rent reduction.  I compliment the Minister of State on that.<\/p><p>  Yet NAMA, the largest property management company in the country has only achieved an average of 14% rent reduction in the years from 2009 to 2015.  It would be better to employ community welfare officers who have succeeded in cutting the rent supplement to a greater extent.<\/p><p>  The Minister represents a busy constituency and is well aware the community welfare officer tells the landlords to cut the rent.  If he were told the cuts in individual rent supplement payments were 14% during the five year period, he would say it was not good enough.  Yet the figures supplied by the Minister of State translate into a 30% reduction but half of the reduction is attributable to the 12% fewer staff.

One may have taken a lease on a property for ten or 20 years, and that still stands irrespective of the state of the economy.  I have figures that show the actual average cost of what we have negotiated against the market price.  Let me illustrate this point.  The average cost per square metre that we have negotiated is &euro;409.  The market average cost is &euro;675.  Let us take the cost per square metre in Dublin, where we have negotiated leases at &euro;289 per sq. m compared to the average of &euro;344 per sq. m  Of course, we should be able to negotiate a lower price, because we are the biggest player in the business.  We are the people who should be looking for break clauses and should be getting out of leases, and we are.  Deputy Fleming made some very positive comments on NAMA during a previous committee meeting, on which I followed up earnestly.  We are aggressively in the market and are getting out of leases.  The new public sector will no longer be taking out long-term leases because we have fewer numbers.  As one would expect because of our clout, we are way ahead of the market in terms of what we negotiated because we have the power to do that in many towns, such as the Deputy's town of Portlaoise, where we are by far we are the biggest player.  If we were not there, then there would be no Portlaoise, which would be terrible.<\/p><p>  A very aggressive strategy has been deployed by our property people.  We can do even better than that.  The way in which we can do better is to be given the directive role, which as I said, will be covered in the proposal we will bring to Cabinet in a matter of weeks.  That will give this office a much greater responsibility in putting pressure on Departments to move.  I think I described it previously to the Deputy as a gigantic chess board which the Office of Public Works has to negotiate.  It is not just about moving one group of staff from A to B.  There are consequences in terms of the numbers involved, the fit-out that is required and whether one has the capital investment to do it.  Those aspects of property management will be accelerated with the new power we will be given under the property memo.  The success that we have experienced in recent years in negotiating lower rents is manifest.  However, Deputy Fleming wants more and if I was on the other side of the House I would have the same questions.

I can state bluntly that the radical reductions occurred in recent years.  The organisation is at its lowest point in terms of numbers for a very long time.  People are having to do things differently.  I will give an example.  The OPW provides architectural help and support to the Department of Education and Skills with regard to the provision of new school buildings.  It can be argued that the OPW should have been doing that before now.  All of that work used to be done by the private sector.  Given that the OPW's architects are not as busy with capital projects as they used to be - the funds are not there - it is understandable that the OPW has been asked to assume responsibility for this.  It is one example of how the OPW is doing things differently.<\/p><p>  I will give a second example.  The OPW's owned estate comprises approximately 60% of the 2,200 buildings it uses.  It is possible that more should have been done in recent years to audit those buildings in terms of thermal efficiency.  Many old and significant buildings should have been adapted for these purposes.  That work is having to be done now.  A great deal of the direct labour that used to be done by the building maintenance service is now being outsourced to contractors because of the squeeze that is on.  The Deputy was right to mention that the reduction in the coming year will be just 1.4%, but he needs to have regard to the enormous reductions of recent years.  We are at the bones of the organisation.  If we start to take more people away, we will have to question whether the OPW can continue to perform the key roles it is asked to perform.<\/p><p>  Most of those who work in the OPW are industrial staff.  They work on the ground in our communities every day, in line with the functions given to them by the State.  The OPW has 1,200 industrial staff and approximately 500 civil servants.  It is not a traditional organisation like the individual Departments.  The majority of OPW workers are industrial staff.  Some members of the committee might be aware that I have tried to recruit volunteers to help us to present our heritage sites.  Approximately 30 pilot projects involving community groups have been rolled out this year at local heritage sites.  The volunteers are helping us to present our sites and offer additional value.  We are working with local communities to try to reinvent the organisation.<\/p><p>  Deputy Donnelly asked about the future of council buildings following the decision announced by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, yesterday.  It is a crucial question.  When I go around the country, I see many brand spanking new buildings with no one in them.  The level of economic activity has brought them into question.  We have responsibility for central government rather than local government.  There is a very strong argument for a property management section within central government to have a remit across the public sector.  That is the space we are moving into.  I said something similar in response to a question asked by Deputy Fleming earlier.  Not only do we have to ensure the function is co-ordinated by central government, but we also have to go further by examining whether better uses can be found for all the public buildings that exist.  Many buildings will be freed up as a result of the decision that was announced yesterday.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked what we would lose in the event of further cuts.  I am very proud that we have managed to ring-fence certain areas, such as flood relief, when cuts have had to be made.  Today's floods in Cork and elsewhere have reminded us of the importance of continuing to roll out capital funds in this regard.  I made a significant announcement that funds will be made available over the next two years for a project in Bray, which is in the Deputy's constituency.  At a time when capital expenditure is being reduced, it is important for this country to continue to invest in flood relief.  Flooding is a major problem, especially in light of the global warming issue.  We have been able to ring-fence that.  It could be argued that further budgetary cuts would lead to the closure of heritage buildings or the withdrawal of some of the guides who show the public around.  We are not at that stage yet.  Workers across the OPW have bought into the changes that have been made within the organisation and agreed to deliver services in a much more efficient way.  I thank them for their forbearance in that regard.<\/p><p>  I do not disagree with what Deputy Donnelly said about the three month budget window.  I think it would be a good thing.

Certainly it is a challenging environment.  I wish to focus on one or two issues.  The Minister mentioned his observations from driving around the county where he saw spanking new buildings, many of which are empty.  My concern is with older buildings.  In the context of local government reform it is possible there will be a substantial number of older buildings which have been in the care of the State in one form or another up to now which may be searching for a tenant.  I am aware - I regret to say this - of many older buildings, some of which have fallen into a state of considerable disrepair, which have considerable heritage value and which under the law of the land, if in private ownership, would possibly be the subject of derelict site notices and compliance orders.  There is a significant challenge for the OPW on how to aggressively pursue the various State agencies, Departments, fisheries and education agencies and the HSE, as their leases on premises expire or are reviewed to move these people into tenancies in these areas.  Is the Department actively involved in compiling an inventory of these buildings and the guesstimate of the costs involved?  There is one such building in Macroom, a former FCA premises, which is in a deplorable state of disrepair.  It is a fine building in the centre of the town.  That is just one example; I am sure the country is littered with similar type buildings.  That is regrettable because such buildings are part of our built heritage and, notwithstanding the difficult times, there is a need to work as hard as possible to transfer tenancies into these buildings.  After an old building has been vacated for six months and the heating has been turned off it falls into a state of considerable disrepair and dampness.  If a building is vacated for six years, one has a real problem.  Many of these buildings have been unoccupied for a long period.  Most town councils around the country are probably housed in old Victorian era buildings which have found a useful way of contributing to the public good but, if vacated, would deteriorate significantly.  That is an issue of which we need to be conscious and work aggressively to remedy.<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to Finglas Garda station and a community cr&egrave;che.  There is much fear in rural areas, although not exclusively, in the context of community policing that there may be a further review of the Garda barrack network as to the likely sustainable number going forward.  Given their low value, particularly in rural areas, closing and putting them up for sale will yield little if anything in the short term because there is no market to purchase many of those buildings for which the OPW is responsible.  Perhaps the Minister would explore the option of making those facilities available to community organisations in order that they can be a fulcrum for delivering social welfare services, community welfare services, Teagasc services and, although in the current environment the Garda authorities may say it does not want the responsibility of maintaining these buildings, they would still be available to the local Garda for community alert meetings or to maintain a presence in an area.  We have to think outside the box in finding new uses, working with local communities.  Whether by lease or nominal lease arrangement that issue should be pursued.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700018#R00300","speaker":"986"},{"type":"speech","time":1350486900,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his remarks.  The whole question of property management is a key part of the public sector reform programme, about which the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has spoken to this committee and the Committee of Public Accounts.  We will be in a much better space when we get the memo through, which will help this organisation to move people around, with agreement, but in a way that maximises floor space.  There is nothing as bad as going into a building that is heated and maintained with a floor unoccupied.  At  present people can move around willy nilly, with just two weeks advance notice, and move elsewhere but we have to pick up the pieces.  I am being honest.  That is not the way to run a property effectively.  We need to have much greater control of property in working with the organisations.  We have started the inventory process which was a key decision of the public sector reform plan.  At first level it will be across Government and not only across each Department but each of the agencies within those Departments.  We have a much better focus on where those buildings are located around the country and their condition.  The Deputy is correct that the cost involved in maintaining these buildings and bringing them up to a standard is astronomical.  In some cases one might argue that it might be easier to hand them to another organisation.  It depends on what the organisation is but I accept many of the buildings are in strategic locations in towns throughout the country and we do not want to diminish that in any shape or form but we have got to manage it.  The new tools we will be given under the public sector reform plan will greatly help us in that regard.  Of course, we have very few new buildings.  That is the reality of capital.  It is about managing the resource we have and adapting that in a more clever way.  Shared office space will be a key issue.  Next year our organisation, working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, will launch a new shared service facility in Clonskeagh for HR which will bring together 350 civil servants to deal with all HR transactions within the Civil Service.  That is a building we custom made in an open plan office.  If one comes to our head office in Trim, one will see an open plan office.  As far as I am concerned that is the office of the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700018#R00400","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350486900,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Is it only for HR?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700018#R00500","nonspeaker":"Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming"},{"type":"speech","time":1350486900,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Sorry, it is HR, payroll, pensions and banking; the first four areas of shared service.

Before becoming a member of this committee, I was involved with the committee dealing with the environment.  One of the concerns we dealt with recently concerned the geo-zoning of areas by insurance companies and the position where certain households, because they were in a particular zone, were unable to avail of flood or subsidence insurance and so on.  A strange comment was made one afternoon by the representative of the Irish Insurance Federation indicating there is no clear correspondence with regard to insurance in areas where flood remediation measures have been carried out.<\/p><p>  The Department and the Minister of State's predecessor spent significant sums of money in recent years on such works, yet households in those areas still have difficulty in obtaining household insurance.  Also, the insurance companies continue to geo-zone those areas as places at risk.  Perhaps it is not a function of this committee, but I would be grateful if it could examine the regulations with regard to how domestic or home insurance operates.  I would be grateful too if the Minister of State could give some indication at a later date as to how the Department interfaces with the insurance industry with regard to works carried out by the Department.<\/p><p>  My city was flooded this morning by a tidal flood.  We rarely get fluvial floods, but we did a couple of years ago.  A number of businesses are in difficulty currently due to the fact that some works are waiting to be done.  These works are probably listed for completion in the next two to three years, but insurance companies just give a blanket refusal to requests for insurance by these businesses.  If a guarantee was provided that the required works would be carried out over a one to two-year period, those companies might be able to get a particular type of insurance, with an excess in place.  For example, a retailer might not be able to get insurance on the property for the two or three-years period while waiting for the work to be done, but should be able to have stock to hand insured.  A further difficulty for such retailers now is that major suppliers, such as Musgraves, are questioning supplying stock to them because they feel the stock is not safe.  This is a huge issue for businesses.  For companies trading on a one-to-one basis, any difficulties with stock and cash flow will create a huge crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700019#S00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1350487500,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I will make a brief comment on that.

We started a process of negotiation with the Irish Insurance Federation last year and talks are ongoing.  It is a matter of great concern to me that we have not managed, thus far, to bring the discussions to a satisfactory conclusion.

We had a good working relationship with his immediate predecessor and I hope the Chairman has the same meteoric rise as he had, in a short period of time.  I am glad to be here because what is happening today is an important step in developing a much more democratic system of scrutiny over the budgetary process.  The current series of meetings between Ministers and various committees represent the first time that committees have convened hearings not just on expenditure outturns for last year, but on prospective Estimates for next year, which is very important.<\/p><p>  The detailed Estimates allocation has not yet been settled and therefore it is timely that elected representatives, such as the members of this committee, should express their views on where the quantum of expenditure for next year should be allocated.  This represents a step in the whole-of-year budgeting process that I announced in the comprehensive expenditure report last December and is a key element of the new medium-term expenditure framework.  As part of this framework, multi-annual expenditure ceilings have been set out for every Minister and Department and these ceilings form the basis upon which Estimates are proceeding.  As Members will be aware, on 28 September last, I published the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 2012, which will put these ministerial expenditure ceilings on a statutory basis, which is one of the commitments made under the EU-IMF programme.  I look forward to discussing and debating that legislation in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  After last December's announcement, I wrote to all committee Chairs inviting them to avail of this new opportunity to participate in the Estimates process in <i>ex-ante <\/i>fashion with Departments.  We are all embarking on new territory and I am pleased to be part of that vanguard today.  In this spirit, I am happy to engage with the committee on next year's Estimates for my Department and associated offices.  I have no doubt that many constructive and thoughtful views will be expressed and upon listening to those views, which will have a bearing on the final Estimates allocation, I assure members that I will have due regard to all worthwhile suggestions that are made.  When the 2013 Estimates are brought before the committee for examination in the new year, we could usefully return to some of the topics and themes that we have canvassed today.  This is, in itself, an important new dimension of accountability and it will enhance the role and policy relevance of committees.  <\/p><p>  I wish to refer now to public expenditure policy even though, strictly speaking, it is not the purview of the work we have to do today, in terms of examining the Department's Estimates.  My Department has the lead role in formulating national expenditure policy, both current and capital, within the context of the Government's overall fiscal policy.  It is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the most challenging and demanding briefs in the Government as a whole and I am satisfied that my Department exercises its role in a skilful manner. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700020#T00300","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350489000,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

We are engaged in dialogue with every line Department with regard to the reduction of the ceiling of both current and capital expenditure to be achieved each year in order to reach the target set in the memorandum of understanding with the troika and indeed, with the commitments in the programme for Government.  We all know what are the main stepping stones.  The Government is committed to having a general government deficit of no more than 8.6%.  We are determined to achieve that and it will be achieved.  It is a painful and difficult process but we will do it.  The target for next year is 7.5% and we need to work incrementally to reduce the deficit below 3% - our target is 2.9% - by 2015.  This will be achieved in a number of ways.  We have set out the medium-term fiscal framework by way of both reduction in expenditure and tax increases and we have set out the annual plan to achieve this.  For next year, 2013, the ambition is to reduce expenditure and increase taxes to make a consolidation of &euro;3.5 billion.  This will be a reduction on the expenditure side of &euro;1.7 billion on current expenditure; &euro;0.55 billion on capital expenditure which is already in the capital framework; the balance of &euro;1.25 billion will be from taxation.  These are challenging and very demanding targets and doubly so in the context of increased demand on public services.  For example, a manufacturing company which decides to reduce staff numbers and costs will find it very difficult to increase its productivity to the extent that we are expecting the public service to increase its productivity.  However, we have done this.<\/p><p>  There has been much negative comment about public sector workers.  In my view they have risen to the challenge.  They have taken very significant pay cuts with an average of 7%, plus a pension levy of 7%.  The average reduction across the public service is 14%.  It ranges from 3% at the bottom to about 30% at the top.  A ceiling has been imposed on top pay so rates at that level have been significantly reduced.<\/p><p>  The Chairman's specific question is about public service pay.  Some recent commentary has said that if we could just savage public service - some expect people to pay to come to work in the public service - that this would solve all our problems.  That is not the case.  However, we need to have a significant contribution to the pathway to economic solvency from reductions in the pay bill.  We have targeted a significant reduction in numbers which have been reduced to date by 28,000 from a peak.  I acknowledge to Deputy Fleming that the process was started by our predecessors.  We still have a way to go, however.  I have indicated I wish to accelerate the pace of downsizing and that is why I have asked for a voluntary focused redundancy programme rather than a general programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700022#V00300","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350489600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming before the committee.  Commencing a general debate on the Estimates for the coming year at this stage is a first small step in the right direction.  I say this despite the fact that the documentation with which we have been presented is based on the policy for 2012 and that the cost of any new policy which might be adopted has not been factored in.  We are operating to some degree in a vacuum, but I accept that this is only the beginning of the process.<\/p><p>  I wish to raise one point in respect of which I would like clarification in order that I might frame my questions.  I take it that the &euro;51 billion in respect of the departmental ceilings represents both current and capital spending.  If that is the case, I will proceed.<\/p><p>  The comprehensive expenditure review has been completed and legally binding targets are going to be imposed on Ministers and their Departments.  What sanctions will apply in circumstances where such targets are not met?  Will it be possible for a Department to simply state at the end of a year that it overspent by &euro;500 million and that it will require additional funds for the following year?  Will sanctions be imposed in respect of this matter?<\/p><p>  Will the Minister assist us in understanding the macro figures with which we have been presented relating to the budget?  Both he and the Minister for Finance have stated the budget adjustment for next year will be &euro;3.5 billion.  The Minister for Finance has indicated that approximately &euro;1.25 billion will be raised on the taxation side.  He has also stated that as he will be carrying forward a figure of between &euro;200 million and 300 million, he will only be obliged to find &euro;1 billion in this regard.  All of this means that some &euro;2.25 billion is going to have to be raised on the expenditure side.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has indicated that expenditure for 2012 was &euro;51.88 billion and that the target for 2013 is &euro;50.589 billion.  That is a difference of approximately &euro;1.3 billion and illustrated in the schedules with which we have been provided.  Will the Minister indicate how it is expected to get from &euro;1.3 billion to &euro;2.25 billion.  I cannot glean what the full picture is from the information provided.  The Minister has indicated that the overall budgetary reduction already includes capital.  From where will the other &euro;1 billion that will make up the adjustment come?  Perhaps he might clarify the position in this regard.<\/p><p>  The next matter to which I wish to refer may not come within the Minister's remit, but given that he has responsibility for public expenditure and reform, he should be able to explain the position.  How is the charge for interest on the national debt worked into the budget figures?  We are discussing taxation and reducing expenditure.  One of the most significant elements of the budget is the cost of servicing the national debt.  This can, depending on international conditions, etc., vary enormously.  I do not know what is the figure for servicing the national debt - it could be &euro;7 billion - but where does it fit into the figures presented to us today?<\/p><p>  The issue of increments was the subject of much discussion both inside and outside the House during the past week.  When the Minister for Finance was before us, we did not have an opportunity to discuss everything with him.  We have been presented with so much documentation that I am only getting the opportunity to read it as we go along.  However, a note was circulated by the Revenue Commissioners which indicated that the average pay of its employees for this year would be &euro;48,844 and for 2013 &euro;49,477.  Revenue notes that this higher average pay will be as a result of the increased cost of increments - approximately &euro;3 million - in 2013.  I accept that the Minister may not be in possession of the note to which I refer which was presented to us during the session with the Minister for Finance.  Revenue employs fewer than 6,000 people, or 3% of the overall public service.  How much, therefore, will increments across the entire service cost?  Revenue appears to have highlighted this as a significant issue.  Will the Minister elaborate on it, particularly as increments are the subject of ongoing discussion and comment.  Does the Minister expect that discussions on increments and targeted savings on allowances - if such are to take place - will be completed by budget day?  If they are not, how will savings, etc., in this regard be factored into the budgetary figures for the coming year?<\/p><p>  A stimulus package of &euro;2.25 billion was announced last July.  Is this money included in the Estimates for next year?  If not, how is it contemplated within the arithmetic relating to the budget?<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to shared services.  We have been informed that it will cost in the region of an extra &euro;10 million to do what he has just outlined in the context of new policies and shared services.  Based on the figures with which we have been presented , provision has not yet been made in this regard.  It is projected that the cost of superannuation and retired allowances will be &euro;466 million.  This is despite the fact that under the comprehensive review of expenditure, a maximum figure of &euro;438 million has been set.  The outcome of all of this is that in addition to the &euro;10 million additional cost for shared services, there will be a further shortfall of &euro;28 million.  I accept that pensioners are going to have to be paid.  This means the Minister will be oblige to find &euro;38 million to cover the shortfall to which I refer in addition to identifying how to reduce expenditure in his Department's group of Votes by 8%.  I wish him well in his efforts in respect of shared services.  However, he is going to be obliged to find an additional &euro;38 million in order to pay for them and to cover the overrun in respect of superannuation and retired allowances.

We will have to make a calculation on growth and tax revenues next year.  It is like the old story of asking directions, when the person asked says if I were you I would not start from here.  It depends on where we start from.  The target outturn figure for this year is a deficit of 8.6%.  We expect to be comfortably within the target.  The previous Department of Finance fiscal forecast indicates a deficit of approximately 8.4%.  If we are at 8.4%, then the journey to 7.5% is a shorter journey than if we are at 8.6%.  There are a number of factors.  The first is what the outturn figure will be for this year; how robust is the inflow of tax; whether it will exceed what we expect and what the projections of that will be for next year and what is the growth estimate.  As members are probably aware, we have revised down the growth figure.  The original estimate last year for this year was 1.2%.  We are still expecting growth of a more modest nature of between 0.5% and 0.7%, depending on whose forecast one takes.  Whatever growth figure is determined for next year will also impact on the quantum of money adjustment that we will determine in the budget.  The details are not set down in stone in that regard.<\/p><p>  The next item on the list of questions relates to increments.

I should advise the committee on the matter as I spoke about it on public radio.  We had a discussion on the issue last week during Question Time when Deputy Fleming in particular made a reasonable request about whether I had investigated stopping increments for those earning more than &euro;100,000.  I did consider that.  As I indicated, the bulk of increments are paid to low-paid public servants within the Civil Service, 50% or slightly more are paid to clerical officers who are not well paid.  The nature of increments is that they are paid to the entrant&rsquo;s grade whether it is to the Garda or teachers.  Increments are for those who start off on the lowest grade.  That would not be the place to start in order to make savings but at a higher level one could make a justification for it.  I asked for the advices of the law officers of the State on the feasibility of doing that.  It would not make much sense targeting people earning more than &euro;100,000 in terms of the quantum of money involved.  The clear advice I had is that increments constitute basic pay and represent part of the terms and conditions applicable to staff.  Pay scales form part of the public announcement of the terms and conditions for recruitment purposes or when promotional competitions are run within the public service.  Increments are awarded as part of pay for pension purposes and therefore their suspension or alteration would have a long-term impact.  In essence, the only way one could remove increments would be by agreement or by legislation.  The latter would be open to challenge in terms of contract law.<\/p><p>  On the stimulus package and where that sits-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700024#X01500","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1350490200,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I am looking for the figures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700024#X01600","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1350490200,"counter":361,"content":"<p>The stimulus package is not in the figures in that it is predicated on an external funding source, namely, the sale of State assets plus investment money from external investors including the European Investment Bank.

The only thing the Minister said that I can agree with is when he defended low and middle income public sector workers, but I point to the fact that his Government and its predecessors have hammered them significantly already.<\/p><p>  In a previous era Croke Park conjured up the excitement of Gaelic football and hurling.  Croke Park is now a term of abuse of public sector workers, but it is manufactured and contrived by sections of the media to hammer and denigrate public sector workers and try to divide them from private sector workers for an agenda that is appropriate to a billionnaire-owned press and not the interests of society.  <\/p><p>  The Minister should be more forthcoming on behalf of public sector workers whom he is hammering on behalf of this bailout fiasco and publish examples of what the increments for low and middle income workers mean, namely, that they are critical to their lives and they have every penny spent for their children, their mortgages or whatever ten years before it arrives.  We should have the truth on that.  The dishonest tactic is to use the &euro;100,000 and &euro;200,000 plus salaries, which I agree are scandalous.  The aping at the higher echelons of what was going on in private capitalism was the only aspect of benchmarking that was completely wrong, and that is being used to hammer the low and the middle income earners.  The Minister should bring the facts and the truth out and not allow this vicious propaganda campaign that has been ongoing for a number of years.<\/p><p>  I put it to the Minister that the reality of the Croke Park agreement, far from being the Eldorado for public sector workers it is conjured up to be by sections of the press, is leading to the destruction of the public sector.  Taking 28,000 jobs out of the public sector has had and is having a detrimental effect on many services, and front line workers such as those in health are bearing the brunt.  That is being conveniently overlooked and the Minister is looking for more now, even when the 2008 OECD report pointed to a modest public service in this country by comparison with European Union counterparts<\/p><p>  I put it to the Minister that his fine words here about external service delivery masks a cruel agenda of privatisation.  It is cruel in many areas but I will put just one to the Minister, namely, what is happening in the home scene.  Public sector home helps are being told to spend less time with elderly residents who desperately need their care.  At the same time leaflets from private providers of paid care are being left in elderly people's homes to pressurise their families to supplement the reduction in public care by paying for these privateers, which they cannot afford.<\/p><p>  I am conscious that when the Minister leaves here he must present himself to the vigilantes of the troika.  Unfortunately, it is their demands that will determine the outcome of the budgetary process.  We might as well be talking here for the next week or leave now because nothing that we say will carry any weight in that regard but I ask the Minister to convey to them that there is huge resistance for this bailout of the European financial system at their behest on the backs of our people, and that resistance will continue.  They live in a cocooned environment.  Why are they staying in the Merrion Hotel, the most expensive hotel in Dublin, and is the Minister paying for that?  Who is paying for it?  They are coming here demanding that we bleed our people.<\/p><p>  The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was here earlier and he outlined some of the same figures.  However, to impose further cuts in capital spending and in the current spending against a background where there are 14,000 fewer jobs in the country in the third quarter of this year compared to the second quarter will mean it will all go in one direction, which is to the detriment of jobs and will result rising emigration.  This whole policy is a disaster.<\/p><p>  The pensions for former officeholders is a scandal and a source of enormous anger.  Of all the anomalies that hurt people it is what is mentioned to me on a daily basis, and there is a basis for it.  That former Ministers are on pensions of over &euro;100,000 is obscene.  The Minister might say he will cut them but a cut of 10% or 15% is nothing.  Nobody should be on a pension more than, say, the equivalent of an average industrial wage worker when he or she retires from their public sector job.  It is incredible that while we have this pressure on home helps and so on, and that is not to tritely put one up against the other, we have these levels of massive pensions.

There is an element, not only in the media, which wants to divide public sector workers and private sector workers.  That is wrong.  They are mutually dependent.  Everybody in the State is dependent on decent public services when we or our family are sick, when our children go to school and when we want to feel secure on our streets with a decent level of policing.  All of that is provided by public sector workers, and the private sector depends upon it.<\/p><p>  I have no compunction in defending the public service but we are in a very broken position economically, and people know that.  We need to work towards balancing our budget because no matter what else we do we cannot continue to heap debt upon the next generation.  We are borrowing substantially more now than we are getting in tax revenues.  We need to balance that equation, and we cannot endlessly tax.  Deputy Higgins and others talk about some pot of gold taxes that is available.  This is the budgetary process.  If the Deputy has any suggestions he should submit them to me and we will have them costed, and any good suggestions will be seized upon.<\/p><p>  In terms of the bailout fiasco, as the Deputy calls it, the bottom line is that last year we were dependent on the troika, that is the IMF, the European Central Bank and the European Commission, providing us with sufficient moneys to keep the country afloat.  Without that we would have a disastrous reduction.  If we had to downsize our public services to the amount that our income in tax revenue would fund it would have been a disaster.  The only people who gave us affordable money last year, and this year, are the troika.  If we had tried to borrow it on the markets it would have been unaffordable, if we could get it at all.  That is the reality of it, and there is no escaping that.<\/p><p>  I gave my view on the issue of increments.

The Deputy is not campaigning against the private sector bin collectors in the same way as he campaigned against the public ones.  He will probably adopt the same approach to water and other services.  That is the very strategy that will ensure privatisation.  Those of us who are interested in quality public services know that public companies such as the ESB can compete with the best.  We do not believe electricity should not be paid for because it is provided by a public company.  This points to the absurdity of some of the Deputy's views on these matters.<\/p><p>  We need to have reforms.  Some services are better offered in the private sphere and others in the public sphere.  We need efficiencies.  I hope to have the efficiencies of the private sector match the integrity and quality of the services of the best of the public service.  This is the reform plan and what we are working towards.<\/p><p>  Pensions for former officeholders are a disquieting issue.  This is why, shortly after I entered office, I examined how we could reduce these pensions.  I introduced the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill and went as far as my legal advice would allow to lower them.  The advice is that pensions are preserved property rights under the Constitution.  Therefore, the claw-back had to be proportionate.  If one adds the pension abatement for pension holders, the significant taxation that applies and the universal social charge, one finds a great difference in the gross and net figures.  <\/p><p>  With regard to public pay generally, we often compare gross figures without examining the net figures based on the significant increases in taxes that now fall on all workers, both public and private.  In the public sector there is the additional 7% pension reduction which is a 7% tax, no matter how one slices and dices it, over and above the normal tax that falls on the private sphere.  Net rates present a different picture, but I agree entirely with the views on a very tiny category of earners, including senior politicians, senior public servants and some very senior officeholders in the public sector who have very large pensions.  There are specific proposals in the programme for Government on the calculation of tax supports for future pensions within the public and private sectors and I hope they will be implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700026#Z00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1350491400,"counter":372,"content":"<p>With regard to the constitutional problems associated with pensions, there is anxiety over the expected turnout in the referendum on the rights of children.

Getting an understanding from our European counterparts has been one of the priorities of the Government from day one.  As I told the committee previously, there are three strands to our economic policy.  The first, which is the most talked about, is working towards balancing the budget, which is the 2.9% deficit by 2015.  We must do that because we cannot continue to borrow.<\/p><p>  Equally, we need to have a jobs and growth strategy.  I have announced the first phase of that.  That will be funded in the ways I indicated and will have a significant jobs impact from next year on.  We need to run out more phases of that.  Importantly, we have put the jobs and growth agenda on the European agenda.  Our voice is being heard increasingly and the jobs and growth agenda is now a formal part of the Heads of Government Council meeting.  There is a particular focus on jobs.  As bad as we are, and we are in a difficult situation, especially on the unemployment front, it is frightening to look at a country such as Spain where youth unemployment is well over 50%.  We need a social policy to deal with that.<\/p><p>  The third strand of our economic policy has been to renegotiate the terms of the deal, and particularly to disconnect the banking debt from the sovereign debt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700027#AA00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1350492000,"counter":390,"content":"<p>We need a write-down, nothing more, nothing less.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700027#AA00300","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1350492000,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I know exactly what we need but I am also trying to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700027#AA00400","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1350492000,"counter":392,"content":"<p>It is justified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700027#AA00500","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1350492000,"counter":393,"content":"<p>Please, let the Minister respond.

Many of us who are first-time parliamentarians find it quite oppressive to be sitting here with restricted numbers and, ultimately, going into a budget without going through the process of having the larger scale numbers, especially at a finance committee, and with the figures being supplied to the specific committees thereafter so that we can have an advanced and mature debate as to how the country gets out of its woes, but I welcome this step.

There is an additional universal social charge of 3% for the self-employed earning over &euro;100,000.

If a graduate started in the private sector on a deal with a salary of &euro;28,000, four months holidays, a permanent job from which he or she could not be removed and a very attractive pension, I would argue that person would not be devastated at not getting a 5% pay increase the following year.  I believe we could be far more targeted.<\/p><p>  When we looked at the Minister's expenditure proposals for this year, I made the point to him - in some cases he agreed - that across the board many areas under his remit, including stationery, travel and legal fees, are increasing year on year.  At the margin all of those should at the very least not be increasing.<\/p><p>  My final point relates to health, which may be outside the remit of this conversation but is very much within the remit of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The schedule from the comprehensive review of expenditure shows a 2% reduction in health spend over two years, which is 1% per year.  When adjusted for the young population, the analysis indicated that we have the second highest <i>per capita<\/i> spend on health in the world after the US.  There is a massive opportunity for billions to be reduced with no detriment to service.  The Minister has argued that his Department is very small, as it is, and it is very difficult to get much meaningful money out of that.  In the Minister's broader remit, a 2% reduction in health for the period from 2012 to 2014, should be seriously reviewed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700030#DD01900","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1350493800,"counter":493,"content":"<p>Does the Minister have time to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700030#DD02000","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1350493800,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I have until 5.30 p.m., at which point I need to return to the office.  I believe we have dealt with increments.  The Deputy has the notion that we should stop increments for everyone.  There is an issue of intergenerational solidarity.  People on the top of the salary scale do not get further increments.  That money is bagged, if one likes.  It is an old idea that as one matures in one's job and acquires new skills, one goes up the scale.  That is as it has been since the foundation of the State.  We are in difficult times and we need to consider how we can do it.  I have said I have an open view on all these matters but there is a legal imperative.  I have explained to the committee that the legal advice I have is that it is a contractual issue and any action in that regard would be challenged.  However, it is something we might look at.<\/p><p>  The Deputy just throws out figures.  An increment for a teacher is not 5% of salary.  I believe the teacher's starting salary for a recent graduate who has spent four years in college is reasonable but not excessive.  We have reduced it by 10%, as the Deputy knows.  We have looked at entry grade salaries across the private sector and some are quite low.  However, there are many graduate entry grades that would be analogous to that.  I am mindful of impacting repeatedly on entry grades because we need to ensure if we make adjustments, they are done on a fair basis across everyone in the public service.  If we are to make adjustments in salary, we should not discriminate between how the salary is acquired and whether it is acquired in the public sphere or the private sphere.  The way to make everyone in society make a fair contribution is through general taxation.  However, that is a debate we can have.<\/p><p>  I am mindful of costs in my Department.  The Department was created last year and is getting new functions.  For example, we are determined to pull the procurement service into the Department and I have advertised for a new procurement officer.  Some very good private sector people have applied for that.  We have not gone through the process and I do not know who will emerge.  Anybody applying for these new jobs in my Department is on contract for a fixed term and we expect results.  That is how we will run the Department.  My Department is not a typical Department that has been there forever and there will be expansion.  We are pulling in new services, including shared services and procurement.  We have created the economic advisory service.  All external reviews of the public service have pointed to a deficiency in economic analysis and we are recruiting world-class young economics graduates to advise not just my Department but across the sphere.  These will add to initial start-up costs as we do that, but I believe they will have a very significant impact on savings in future.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's final point was on health.  We have all seen that a reduction in health expenditure is very painful.  We are doing three things simultaneously, which is difficult.  First, we are downsizing numbers.  The biggest component of public service numbers is in the health area, which has been significantly downsized while trying to keep services going.  Comparing health services internationally is difficult because what comprises health services differs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700030#DD02100","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350494400,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Does the Minister believe 2%-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700031#EE00200","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1350494400,"counter":497,"content":"<p>We are already ten minutes over time and Deputy Donnelly has already had 30 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101700031#EE00300","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1350494400,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I have a supplementary question.

If accepted, they would contravene the provisions in the Bill that exempt private arrangements from vetting.  Furthermore, these amendments would require the vetting of persons who provide any level of childminding for any period.  This is not practical.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy may know, the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 2006 already require vetting for all persons working in child care facilities that provide a service for three or more children.  The national vetting bureau Bill also requires that any agency or relevant organisation providing childminding, nanny or <i>au pair<\/i>  services must apply for vetting disclosures in respect of the persons that it employees to provide such services.<\/p><p>  However, the &quot;relevant organisations&quot; definition contained in the Bill very deliberately excludes private arrangements made by parents to have their children minded outside of regulated child care services.  This is for a number of reasons, but principally two.  First, it is not practical or feasible for the State to seek to police all private childminding arrangements.  For example, if a parent chooses a grandparent, in-law, neighbour, nanny, <i>au pair<\/i>,  sibling or family friend to mind his or her child regardless of whether that person is paid, the parent is free to make child care arrangements that are appropriate to his or her circumstance.

It would not be remotely practical for a parent giving a child or some children a lift to have to be vetted.  Where there is a commercial arrangement, involving the school bus driver or a bus hired by a team on a weekly basis to take a team of 14-year-olds or 15-year-olds somewhere, for example, it would fall under the Bill.  It is detailed in paragraph (8) of Part 1 of Schedule 1: \"Work as a driver of a public service vehicle which is being used only for the purpose of conveying children.\"  A driver in that position must of course be vetted.<\/p><p>  We are trying to allow people get on with their ordinary lives but for public service vehicles or commercial operations, individuals regularly in contact with children must be vetted.  In our constituencies there are many different sports teams with parents involved.  Parents who are coaches of such teams must be vetted.  I am sure that where sons and daughters of the members have been on teams, many of us have gone to look at a game and we would pick up a couple of their friends on the way.  Often, parents may alternate this practice if they do not watch every match.  It would be impossible to provide for vetting in those circumstances, and it would be a gross invasion of individual privacy, as well as family and friend relationships.  It would impose a burden on the vetting bureau that would be impossible, and we could end up in a position in which large portions of the population which provide temporary assistance with family sporting arrangements would have to go through a vetting process.  Even worse, these people would be criminalised if they did not go through the process.  We must be very careful in achieving a balance.  We believe this legislation has achieved that, although I like to say that in these cases nobody has a monopoly of wisdom.

In practical terms, the Garda has informal relationships with a variety of police forces around the world for vetting purposes.  We cannot compel the police force of any other country to co-operate with us, but a number do.  If we receive similar requests, we also co-operate.  The Deputy is seeking to amend the section to provide expressly for something that already happens in practice.  I am advised that the amendment is not necessary.  If the bureau is asked to vet an individual and knows he or she has been working outside Ireland or that information is given, it does not need express authority to seek the assistance of other police forces because it can already do this.  There is no prohibition on it doing so and, of course, it happens in practice.  My advice is that it is unnecessary, therefore, to insert the proposed wording in the legislation.<\/p><p>  Let us say, for example, an individual has been resident in Ireland for ten years.  That person is vetted and there is no difficulty during his or her time in Ireland, but he or she came here from a far flung country, not necessarily in the European Union from where we receive a great deal of co-operation but, for example, somewhere in South America.  I do not want to create an obligation whereby before the Garda gives a response to a vetting application, it must communicate with and obtain a response from a police force in South America.  One might find, first, that one will not receive a reply and the whole thing could become gridlocked, or one might receive a response that is completely inaccurate and could create a problem.  I am anxious to ensure we do not create a perception in the legislation that we have the capacity to obtain accurate information from any country in the world.  Of course, we can receive information from certain police organisations, whether it be Northern Ireland with which we have significant co-operation or one of the international police organisations in certain circumstances.<\/p><p>  I will seek a further view from the Attorney General on the amendment.  I have to be careful not to include something in the legislation that either could give rise to a perception that the impossible can be done or that does not create a barrier for individuals who have lived in this country for many years but who have a foreign nationality or have become Irish citizens in recent years.  They might have lived, for example, in Sri Lanka, Pakistan or India, in the early years of their life and there might be difficulties in obtaining information from there.  This could block them from gaining reasonable employment which they are perfectly suitable to obtain.  Perhaps the Deputy might let us give further thought to this amendment before revisiting it on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012101700007#F02100","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1350481200,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's offer to seek advice from the Attorney General.  On the basis of what he said, that is logical.  However, one can understand the concern.  Irish, British or citizens of many other European states and so forth can be checked by the Garda, but there is a fear that there might be a vacuum in security otherwise.  The Minister has pointed out that this could discriminate against an applicant and, in most cases, it probably would.  However, that fear is about the one or two exceptional cases where the state from which they come happens to be unco-operative or inefficient in its response times.

In these situations it is wise and prudent to err on the side of caution by not vetting them.  The onus must be on the applicant sponsoring body to ensure it is in a position to put forward people who can provide reliable information from their home jurisdiction.  We live in a global village and there have been instances in the past, perhaps not involving child welfare issues, where people in this country from other jurisdictions had serious criminal records which the State, regrettably, discovered only at a later date, at some cost to citizens of the State.

However, in the context of the practical work the vetting bureau has undertaken so far, there has not been an example of which I am aware of a circumstance in which somebody who originally had a foreign residence but has been living in this country for many years has been vetted and deemed suitable for a position was subsequently proved not only to be unsuitable but to have a concealed foreign criminal record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012101700007#F02400","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350481800,"counter":608,"content":"<p>I am a bit of a green horn so I must ask about this.

I would ask for the opportunity to consider that.  There may be difficulties as a result in the sense that we could not have a situation where if an incident occurred and garda&iacute; were merely investigating it, they would furnish a series of possible suspects to the vetting bureau where those people could all be entirely innocent.<\/p><p>  There are human rights issues involved also.  Vetting as envisaged under the legislation is vetting of the individual at the time the vetting is undertaken.  It could be a logistical nightmare to have rolling vetting and any issue that subsequently arose about an individual would be the subject of further additional information. <\/p><p>  Putting this in the context of other legislation, if someone is vetted and is working with children and is subsequently charged and convicted of a sexual offence, under the Sex Offenders Act that person is required to inform his or her employer of the fact he or she has been convicted if he or she works with children or vulnerable adults.  If he or she fails to do so, that is an offence.  I originally hoped to have a new sexual offences Bill published before the end of the year but based on the schedule it will be published some time in the first half of next year, but as far as we can make some of the protections in that area more rigorous, we are addressing that in the new Bill.<\/p><p>  An issue is that when someone is convicted, he or she must register as a sex offender within seven days of moving to a new location and we are examining this area.  Again we must be careful.  If someone was convicted of a minor offence, such as not paying half a dozen parking tickets, should that be included in circumstances where he or she works with children and vulnerable adults?  Offences would have to be identified for when it is appropriate, which member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be responsible for reporting it to the vetting bureau and the creation of a separate section within the vetting bureau to track where people are employed so the information can be communicated.

For example, in relation to dealing with soft information, the person being vetted must be informed about what information is available and be given the opportunity, through the processes prescribed in the legislation, to address it if he or she believes it to be untrue or inaccurate in some way.<\/p><p>  This amendment is unnecessary for a number of reasons.  The operation of any legislation has to be compliant with the Constitution in its entirety, not just in respect of two specified Articles.  It is, therefore, not appropriate or necessary to suggest that a Bill should be compliant solely with the Articles named by the Deputy in his amendment.  Equally, the operation of legislation must be compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights.  In any event, I consider that the wording of subsection <i>(f) <\/i>of this Section pays due regard to the principles of the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  This states that the bureau shall have regard to &quot;whether the rights of the person have been considered and taken account of in a manner that is consistent with fairness and natural justice&quot;.  <\/p><p>  In effect, this Bill, like all others, is subservient to the express provisions in our Constitution and the court judgments interpreting their application.  It would be most unusual, in that context, to publish legislation that recites within it that it must meet a certain requirement of a particular Article in the Constitution because there is a particular vision within the Constitution which requires that legislation accord with it when it is enacted through the Houses.  One of the reasons we have provisions for an Article 26 reference to the Supreme Court is that, where a Bill has gone through both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il and the President has a doubt about its constitutionality, it can then be tested under that reference.  <\/p><p>  We have a double-lock mechanism with regard to legislation.  In the first instance, we have the obligation on Government to publish legislation that is not at variance with or in violation of our Constitution.  Ultimately, if there is an issue as to the constitutionality of legislation, the President can make a reference, having consulted with the Council of State.  If all of that fails and there is a constitutional impropriety, it is open to any citizen to bring a constitutional case if they deem it appropriate or if they feel that rights are being violated.  The particular Articles named by the Deputy could be relevant and applicable, if that was the case.  Indeed, if there was an issue relating to the European Convention on Human Rights, again, under legislation enacted some years ago, the courts have an entitlement, domestically, to proof legislation against that convention.  Finally, citizens have a right to go to the European Court of Justice.  There is a whole range of protections in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012101700009#H00200","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1350482400,"counter":625,"content":"<p>We are not doing too badly given that this is my seventh amendment but only our first disagreement.

It is really valuable that Deputies, at an early stage, can contribute to the drafting and publication of Bills, rather than simply being confronted by them, as a substantially completed project, when they are presented by Government.  This early input will ensure that we will have far better legislation enacted by the House.  I am very grateful for the work of the committee and thank Members for their co-operation in completing Committee Stage.  I am very anxious to enact this Bill as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012101700009#H03700","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350483000,"counter":657,"content":"<p>We also wish to recognise the work the officials have done on the legislation, and the work done by those in the Office of the Attorney General.

We are very pleased to be here and it is the first time the organisation has appeared before an Oireachtas committee.  With me are Mr. J. J. Kavanagh, managing director of J. J. Kavanagh and Sons, which has operations in London and runs a service from Urlingford to Kilkenny which is older than the State as it started in 1919; Mr. John Halfpenny, managing director of Halfpenny Travel in Dundalk which runs another long running bus service, from Blackrock to Dundalk, which started in 1920; and Mr. Noel Matthews, director of Matthew Coach Hire Limited which runs commuter services from Dundalk to Dublin.<\/p><p>  The Coach Tourism and Transport Council, CTTC, advocates for full, open and fair tendering for all public service obligation bus services.  We call for the tendering to take place on a phased basis over the five year period from 2014 to 2019.  Routes should be tendered for on single contracts and in small bundles to ensure maximum participation by transport companies in the tendering process.  The success of this new system will depend on well designed and judiciously enforced service level agreements.  This is in contrast to the current situation which is best described by the Competition Authority in a document submitted to the National Transport Authority, NTA, last year.  It stated:<blockquote>Where there is a lack of competition, businesses are not incentivised to attract customers.  For example, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are the sole service providers of PSO services.  There are not sufficient incentives or external pressures on Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann to deliver high quality PSO services in an efficient way.  As a result, the consumer suffers higher prices, less choice and lower quality, and the public finances pay higher subsidies than are needed.<\/blockquote>We echo these comments and hope the committee will help us overturn this situation.<\/p><p>  It is beyond argument that savings will be made by tendering for public service obligation routes.  The only question is how much can be made in savings.  The current PSO subsidy to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann is approximately &euro;110 million a year.  Calculating the percentage that would be saved is difficult, but we have used the recent value for money review of school transport to benchmark the savings that could be made.  The value for money review estimated that private operators were 21% cheaper or more efficient than Bus &Eacute;ireann.  A 21% saving on PSO services suggests savings to the State of &euro;23 million a year without a deterioration in services.  This is backed up by Privatisation and Regulation of Urban Transit Systems, a study published in 2008 by the OECD which tracked the effects of privatisation on the efficiency of public transport systems throughout the world.  All reports consistently state savings are made - costs were reduced by 38% in Adelaide; by 34% in Copenhagen; by 40% in Greece; by 26% to 34% in Helsinki; by 18% according to one report and by 10.5% according to another in London; by 30% in Spain; by 8% to 15% nationwide, by 13.4% in local bus services in Sweden; and by 33% in Perth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101700003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Mullins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350462900,"counter":704,"content":"<p>He heard Mr. Mullins's call.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101700004#D00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350462900,"counter":705,"content":"<p>In respect of airlines, we are all familiar with the example of Ryanair.

Mr. Mullins's presentation was good in that it seeks to address some of the issues of concern.<\/p><p>  On London Bus, I was part of a transport committee in 2004 which visited London Bus, at which time we were told that while there were service level agreements in place, the quality of the service diminished over time, with operators, having undercut each other to the extent that they were not able to deliver the service, having to effectively tear up their contracts.  The cost to the national Government of taking control of the service again was enormous because of the deterioration in services.  Are there any lessons to be learned from that which would allow service providers here ensure they are in a better position?<\/p><p>  Mr. Mullins spoke of the benefits to the State.  I am not opposed to what is being proposed but would like to tease it out with him.  Mr. Mullins referred to significant savings and set out the experience in a number of other jurisdictions.  However, additional costs will have to be borne by the State in managing the smaller bundles.  Currently this is done by way of direct contract with one company, in respect of where there are also inherent failures.  If we are to have multiple bundles the National Transport Authority will have to take on greater costs.  In my opinion, there will be cost transfer rather than cost savings.  Has Mr. Mullins undertaken any analysis of the costs in this regard?<\/p><p>  On the transfer of undertakings, this is a real issue.  I am not a labour law expert.  However, it would be worth while taking a greater look at this issue in terms of costs and so on.  If the new providers do not take on former CIE staff, this cost will have to be borne by Bus &Eacute;ireann or Dublin Bus or the State, in terms of redundancies.  While there are significant potential savings to be made, Mr. Mullins did not outline the additional costs likely to be borne by the State.

There is concern that major companies in the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland would monopolise the industry, in terms of their taking on the more profitable routes rather than providing services to small rural villages.

What percentage of the school transport routes would have a service?  There has been a review and restructuring which has led to a reduction in such routes over the past 12 months in particular.  If the private operators had a larger share of that market, would they provide a more competitive service at a reduced cost, which may enable the Department of Education and Skills to fulfil the old school routes?

How much integration is there with Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland in promoting the country?  There is a role for everybody in the transport industry to become involved in bringing more people into the country.  A significant number of beds are lying idle in hotels and guest houses and there is a role for the private operators here to get into the global market.

There is significant scope for development and much encouragement given by authorities in London.  We have received funding from Hertfordshire County Council to expand and develop our services to a greater extent over there, including costs and capital expenditure.  There is a proactive mood in London with regard to public transport.  I suggest that public transport in London is growing and the model used is very effective and has more than adequate controls.  For example, there is currently development of a prototype bus for launch in London, and that has been instigated by Transport for London.  It is like the older red buses that had a platform instead of a back door.  The cost of operation in London relative to the market size is quite small, and the market is working.  Deputy Dooley was there eight years ago and there has been remarkable change since then.<\/p><p>  We are here to discuss public service obligation, PSO, routes.  The network is defined and we are talking about being allowed to tender for these routes.  This is separate to commercial routes, which are licensed by the National Transport Authority.

We seek those services.<\/p><p>  For all the shortcomings in the map, one can consider the south east, where there is a comprehensive network of services operating at no current cost to the Exchequer.  Many of the services provided in rural Ireland today come through private operators at no cost to the Exchequer, and many of the services operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann in rural Ireland occur one day a week.  To say there is a comprehensive PSO network operating in rural Ireland is wrong, and the comprehensive service is operated by private companies.  If the private operator was allowed to tender, the service network would be enhanced dramatically and there would be an increase in activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101700006#F01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. J.J.

There is an issue here.  If things go the way we expect, a great deal more work will be done by the private sector and less work will be done by the State companies.  Inevitably, those companies will contract.  What will happen with the staff?  First, it is written in the legislation that this would happen over a five year period starting in 2014.  We are two years away from that so we are looking at a seven year timeline.  Over that period there will be natural attrition of the Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus ranks.  Second, those companies are introducing cost saving measures.  There will be people who simply wish to transfer across, as there will be more job opportunities on our side, and there will be lay-offs.  However, one cannot hold up the progress that public transport must make in this country simply because there will be a cost to Bus &Eacute;ireann or Dublin Bus in laying off staff.  There will also be benefits to the two companies.  We expect to end up inevitably buying vehicles from them, so cash will be going in the opposite direction.  In addition, we will be hiring staff if everything goes the way we plan.<\/p><p>  I will move to Deputy O'Mahony's questions.  First, I wish to express my gratitude to him.  When we were here a few weeks ago, it looked as if we would not be invited to appear before the committee.  Deputy O'Mahony explained that he would look into it, after which we were invited.  We are grateful for that.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about membership of our organisation.  We have 65 companies, all family owned.  There are 1,900 operators in the country, but a very large proportion of this sector consists of one and two vehicle companies.  Our organisation was formed as a coach tourism trade group and one had to have at least two coaches.  Traditionally, the slightly larger companies were members of our group and the minibus drivers and smaller companies may have joined other organisations.  It is safe to say that even though they are not our members, we are speaking largely on their behalf.  The combined fleet of the Coach Tourism and Transport Council, CTTC, is more than 1,000 vehicles.  We employ approximately 2,000 people directly and several thousand indirectly.  Therefore, even though we are a small number of the 1,900 we are quite a large proportion.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about the downside.  It is a little like the Aer Lingus and Ryanair situation.  Aer Lingus suffered when the system changed.  There is no doubt it went through a great deal of pain.  However, it has come out the far side as a very strong, lean, efficient and dynamic company.  It was not like that before the airline industry was restructured.  Undoubtedly, the company and its staff went through pain.  Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus will have to go through a similar process, and that is the downside.  However, we cannot let that downside stop the progress this country must make in terms of public transport.  PSO services are too expensive.  We are proposing to reduce the cost by &euro;20 million per year.  That is a win for the Exchequer and the taxpayer.  We are proposing that we provide the services.  We are very good at it and we have proven that year in, year out over the decades, despite the best efforts of the Government to stop us in all sorts of ways, unfairly in most cases.  We are offering as good a public transport service, if not better, and we are offering to do it at a lower cost.  They are two wins.  There will be a downside from the point of view of Bus &Eacute;ireann, which the committee will hear about later, but we cannot let that relatively small group of people stop the progress this country needs to make.  There is also the capital investment issue whereby the State has invested very heavily in vehicles.  All our vehicles are self-financed.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about Belmullet and Senator Mooney asked about Roosky and various other places.

The only place on which the private operator could compete was on the expressways and by establishing new routes.  What we would intend to do with PSOs is turn them commercially, with the help of the National Transport Authority.  We believe they do not meet the needs of their target market.  They are running at the wrong times and they are really old services.  Times have changed and towns have grown.  The PSOs do not suit the needs.  If we were successful in getting a PSO contract, we would like to work with the NTA to revisit the times, perhaps, and the route and integrate it with others.  I do not believe there should be school buses, rural transport buses, express buses and so forth.  They are all buses.  One bus can do the lot.

The same goes for the Roosky and Dromad issue.  It would bring a mix into the commercial operation but would not undermine the commercial viability of those operations and it would not leave communities completely isolated, as is happening at the moment.  The current system is purely driven by profits from non-stop services from one city to another, which has been a disaster in Britain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101700008#H00500","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1350465300,"counter":739,"content":"<p>Mr. Mullins said there is room in the PSO contracts for the State to run services in these small areas on a subsidised basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101700008#H00600","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350465900,"counter":741,"content":"<p>I wish to make an observation on the map.

As Mr. Mullins stated there is a significant difference between inter-urban and local service routes.  It is like comparing apples with oranges.  At present the intercity routes are commercial routes operated by every company.  Some rural services operated by the State company are PSO routes.  Those operated by the private operators are commercial routes because there is no subsidy available to them.  Throughout Ireland, every service operated in every provincial town and city by the State company is a PSO whereas every service provided by a private operator is a commercial route, at no cost to the State.  In Waterford city, some 25 to 30 buses are operated by the State company, each one of them provided and paid for by the State at a cost of &euro;200,000 per unit, which approximates to &euro;5 million.  We, J.J. Kavanagh and Sons, and Suirway Bus &amp;amp; Coach Services operate services in the city at no cost to the State.  We buy our own vehicles.  Members should embrace the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland, CTTC.  We have a proven track record of providing transport services.  We provide 90% of the transport for incoming tourists and 85% of the school transport service.  We can deliver and save the State money.<\/p><p>  Senator Sean D. Barrett asked about capital investment.  The State capital investment has distorted competition in the market.  The number of vehicles that have been provided by the State for the CIE companies in the past ten years is phenomenal.  There are 85 coaches waiting in Wrights to be delivered to Dublin Bus at a cost of &euro;300,000 per unit.  The private operators have never received or requested a grant from the State, yet we have the most modern up-to-date fleet.  Ireland has one of the most modern fleets in Europe.  The investment incurred by private operators in the past ten years in particular has been phenomenal.  We have the safest fleet in the marketplace at no cost to the Exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101700009#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. J.J.

We spoke at the Joint Committee on Transport in 2008 and 2009.  Most of what we predicted at that stage has come to pass.  We have done most of what we promised to do.  In 2008, we were worried about the effect the motorways would have on towns and villages.  We said we would stick with the towns and villages for as long as we could, while acknowledging that we were likely to have problems on commercial routes in the future.<\/p><p>  In 2009, we spoke about the efficiencies we would introduce at Bus &Eacute;ireann to ensure the State got a better return.  We also went through the Deloitte value for money report that was drawn up for the then Department of Transport.  The report had come to the conclusion that Bus &Eacute;ireann was as efficient and effective as its European peers even though it received one of the lowest subventions in Europe.  The OECD report that was mentioned earlier spoke about the savings that could be achieved in cities with many millions of residents.  Bus &Eacute;ireann's subvention has been reduced by 25%.  Those savings are in the system.  The pain has been taken.  There are more savings in the system.<\/p><p>  The role of the National Transport Authority in the direct award contract is possibly misunderstood.  The authority is heavily involved in everything Bus &Eacute;ireann does with regard to the public service obligation contract.  We work together on a daily basis.  We have met all of the authority's targets.  I will speak later about our high customer satisfaction rating.  We have achieved the efficiencies and effectiveness measures that are required for the Exchequer.  I will go through them later in the meeting.<\/p><p>  The map of Ireland that is being shown to the committee depicts the approximately 350 public service obligation and intercity routes we provide.  We also have approximately 6,000 school bus routes, which cover every corner of this country.  We serve thousands of towns and villages.  I could not possibly have all the information on each of them.  That is why I have brought my regional managers with me.  I hope that between us, we can answer most questions about what goes on around the country.  No other organisation in this country can match Bus &Eacute;ireann's road transport reach.  AA Roadwatch and all the radio stations contact Bus &Eacute;ireann every morning to ask us about traffic conditions.  That aspect of our role came to the fore during the bad weather of recent years.  Bus &Eacute;ireann knows how the roads of this country work.<\/p><p>  As a transport management company, Bus &Eacute;ireann plans all of its routes.  I have mentioned our extensive reach.  We have inspectors in every locality.  We know the schools, the towns and our customers.  We are able to bring our local knowledge to bear on a national basis.  Our motto is \"think local - act national\".  Bus &Eacute;ireann has 2,500 staff in 17 locations throughout the country.  We have 90 people based in Tralee and 70 people based in Stranorlar, to give two examples.  We have smaller numbers of people in many other villages and towns throughout the country.<\/p><p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has a complex and sophisticated network.  It facilitates 78 million passenger journeys every year.  It has a turnover of just over &euro;280 million.  We have 2,500 employees of our own, as I have mentioned.  There are more than 8,000 people in our system as a whole, when aspects of our business like bus hire and school transport are considered.  Some 25% of our maintenance is outsourced.  The livelihoods of 6,000 people who are not employees of Bus &Eacute;ireann depend on the company.<\/p><p>  We have fixed overheads, in the form of depots, at every one of our locations.  Those facilities are shared between the company's three products - Expressway, school transport and public services.  Like any three-legged stool, Bus &Eacute;ireann has to ensure it does not lose a leg so it does not keel over.  If that were to happen, the cost of the fixed overheads would fall back on the State.  We try to avoid that.<\/p><p>  As we predicted when we last appeared before an Oireachtas committee, the opening of the motorways, the sanctioning of new licences and the deterioration in the economy led to a decrease in our revenues and passenger numbers, although they have since stabilised.  There has been a slight growth in some provincial cities in more recent times.  The 25% decrease in our subvention that I mentioned will be followed by further decreases in the next couple of years.  We have always washed our face financially.  We made a small profit last year, we will make a small loss this year and we will be back into profit next year.  The decrease of &euro;28 million in our operational costs is more than the decrease in our revenue.<\/p><p>  The image being shown to the committee at the moment depicts the increase in the cost of fuel, which has affected Bus &Eacute;ireann and every other transport operator in the country.  Our fuel costs have increased from &euro;15.7 million some years ago to &euro;35.9 million this year.  That includes the loss of the fuel duty rebate in 2008.<\/p><p>  We provide vital social links for communities, many of them at no cost to the State.  We employ more than 1,400 contractors throughout the country.  Most of them are small contractors with fewer than five vehicles.  We contribute in excess of &euro;55 million in Exchequer taxes and excise duties that are returned to the State.  We must make sure that return to the Exchequer is maintained in any new regime.<\/p><p>  The next slide relates to efficiency and effectiveness.  As I have mentioned the Deloitte report, I will not go through it.  We are as efficient and as effective as our European peers because we did not receive an extra subvention during the 2000s.  When we had to make extra payments under the national pay deals - we did not pay them all - we demanded productivity measures to ensure our finances were right.  There has been a 25% reduction in our subvention since then.  We have reduced our cost base by over 10%.  The National Transport Authority said in a recent report that Bus &Eacute;ireann's productivity has increased by over 11% in recent years.  That is in addition to the savings that have arisen from the reduction of more than 12% in staff numbers in recent years.  There has been no major reduction in service levels over that time.<\/p><p>  We are working on further efficiency measures.  On their own, they will not return us to the position where we need to be.  We have to make some changes on our Expressway routes.  Some of them have gone through and others will go through in the coming months.<\/p><p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann is the biggest customer of private operators in this country.  We pay more than &euro;114 million to such operators every year.  I have mentioned that we work with 1,400 private operators on the school transport scheme and that 25% of maintenance is outsourced.  We have some joint products.  On the Dublin-Cork route, for example, we are in business with GoBus to bring 15 services between the two cities every day.<\/p><p>  The commercial Expressway services provided three benefits to the State.  First, they paid for overheads at many depots around the country at no cost to the State, as I have said.  Second, they went into towns and villages at no cost to the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101700010#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350467100,"counter":757,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nolan.

The presentation sets out clearly what the company does, some of which is probably lost on the public on occasion.  However, we are not here to talk about the company but to discuss whether it is better for the National Transport Authority to proceed with the direct award system or to go down the road of selective tendering for certain bundles of routes.  Previous speakers have outlined where they believe considerable cost savings can be made.  We would like to hear the particular views of the representatives on the issue.<\/p><p>  A couple of issues arose during the previous presentation.  I do not know whether the representatives had an opportunity to hear it.  Mr. Mullins asked, in the event that a decision was made to opt for selective tendering, if there would be a requirement in respect of the transfer of undertakings for the CTTC to hire people from CIE.  If it were to be successful in that regard, what would be the cost of having to dispense with the services of some of the drivers in question?  Would it be seen as a significant cost and, if so, can Mr. Nolan quantify it?  In the event that a decision is taken to go down the route of selective tendering, does he envisage an impact on the network as a result of the reassigning of certain bundles of routes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101700011#L00300","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350467700,"counter":760,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nolan for his presentation and thank the officials who have attended for it.  Like Deputy Dooley, I am very interested in hearing Bus &Eacute;ireann's reaction to what has been said by the private coach operators.  They say they would provide the PSO services cheaper and better.  If we take what they said at face value, they can do this better, but I presume Bus &Eacute;ireann has the opposite opinion.  I would like the representatives of Bus &Eacute;ireann to be as direct as the private operators were in giving their side.<\/p><p>  The changes with regard to Expressway routes have been an issue in recent weeks and I acknowledge Bus &Eacute;ireann's engagement on that.  Perhaps I can be parochial here, as I am sure other members will be also.  Mr. Nolan mentioned in his presentation that some changes have been implemented and others are on the way.  Are those changes on the way more of the same?  Mr. Nolan said in another part of his presentation that he cannot engage with communities for reasons of commercial sensitivity and that it is difficult to engage with communities in advance.  We have had the same issue with regard to post offices.  We are here to serve our communities but it is important that where communities are not making sufficient use of a service, they are given the opportunity either to make more use of the service or lose it.<\/p><p>  The issue in the case of Carracastle in County Mayo was that the changed bus route was a longer route, but there were no extra pick-up points.  Therefore, the contention that there would be extra passengers on the Expressway route did not apply.  It is very difficult to convince communities this would make any sort of saving for Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Rather, it would increase costs.  I acknowledge the fact Bus &Eacute;ireann has reversed some of the decisions it made there and that it has replaced some of the services with local PSO routes.  It is important that any changes the company makes should stand up and achieve what it says they will.  I would appreciate this being addressed in the response.<\/p><p>  In some discussions I have had with Mr. Nolan, he mentioned at some stage that Expressway services go into Dublin Airport and that Bus &Eacute;ireann is charged for access to Dublin Airport for those routes.  Is it the situation that one semi-State company is paying another semi-State body?  Does this charge apply to Dublin Airport alone or must the company pay for access to other airports also?  This situation does not add up for the ordinary punter and they would not be aware of it.  The Expressway services to Dublin Airport are very successful and widely used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101700012#M00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1350467700,"counter":761,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nolan for his presentation.  He made the point that Bus &Eacute;ireann was engaged in trying to provide local services where it had decided to stop picking up passengers on a number of routes on the Expressway service.  We raised this issue with the private operators earlier.  A number of Bus &Eacute;ireann regional managers are present here, but this issue would be quite specific to what has been happening on the N4.  In a response I received on this via the Minister's office, I was informed that there is a move towards local consultation with regard to providing a rural service.  How involved will Bus &Eacute;ireann be in this?  The rural transport link is provided with an annual amount of money, approximately &euro;11 million, and it is operated through the partnerships that provide rural transport.  How does Bus &Eacute;ireann envisage addressing transport in those areas it will now leave, where there are passengers who will be left without a service?  This question relates to Expressway.<\/p><p>  Mr. Leahy, the regional manager for the north west, suggested a compromise of having one service going up and one service returning, but the local reaction to that was that it would go too early in the morning, at 7.30 a.m.  They suggest it should be later in the day.  Has there been any advance in regard to that?  In another part of Leitrim where a service has been withdrawn, this is directly affecting Ballinamore and Mohill.  Is this as a result of the withdrawal of the Swanlinbar-Bawnboy service?  The withdrawal of service is leaving an entire geographical area of south Leitrim without any transport service whatsoever.  I do not want to take up the time of the meeting by going into the detail of the inconvenience this is causing, but wish to refer to a letter given to Mr. Padraig Griffin, secretary of the Ballinamore area community council, from an old age pensioner of 80 years of age who had to get a lift.  She said she left home at 9 a.m. and did not get home until 4 p.m. and had to rely on people to pick her up and on taxis.  To a large extent, it is the vulnerable and the elderly who will suffer as a result of the changes being made.

As a result of the changes in the closed school rule and the changes to the catchment boundary areas, there have been significant consequences for families and communities.  Pupils are travelling to different parishes as a result of these changes.  For example, there could be four children from one family going on one bus to a school and another child from the same family travelling on another bus to the nearer school, which might be in a different parish, as a result of these logistical changes.  I compliment Bus &Eacute;ireann staff on how they have dealt with this because it has been difficult.  They have dealt with the matter in a helpful and professional manner.<\/p><p>  In the context of the value for money report 2011, what savings, if any, have been made as a result of the changes to the closed school rule and the catchment boundaries?  I appreciate Mr. Nolan may not be able to give a specific answer on that today, but I would appreciate it if he could come back to me on that.  How many students avail of free school transport nationally?  Again, Mr. Nolan may not have that information, but I would appreciate it when he can provide it.  <\/p><p>  My next question relates to a specific route, Rathmullan to Letterkenny.  The bus leaves Rathmullan at 8 a.m. - it is a Lough Swilly Bus service - but it does not return to Rathmullan.  Has Bus &Eacute;ireann looked at this particular route or does it look at weaknesses in such areas?

I wish to raise questions on the Expressway routes.  County Kerry, a peripheral county in the south-west corner of the country is reliant on tourism.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is a core service and provides access to the county.  The patients in County Kerry are transferred to the regional hospitals in Limerick and Cork.  There is a great deal of concern and people are worried about the routes from Killarney, Tralee, Limerick and Cork.  Due to our geographic location, I request that Bus &Eacute;ireann would maintain the existing Expressway routes.<\/p><p>  To what extent is Bus &Eacute;ireann operating in the tourism sector?  In particular, I believe there is a role for promoting the country internationally and in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  Should Bus &Eacute;ireann be widening its scope and branching out to offset against losses on internal routes?  Is there a role for Bus &Eacute;ireann to work with hotels to the benefit of both?  What is the percentage of passengers who are eligible for free travel?<\/p><p>  We have been told by CTTC that it provides 85% of the school transport service.

I am conscious the issue is before the courts, so he may be restricted in what he can say.  He also mentioned that he engages with 1,400 local private operators that operate the school bus transport service.  Is that not evidence that private operators can step into the breach, especially in rural areas and provide services to rural dwellers?  Deputy Fleming referred to the fact that 85% of the vehicles providing school transport are privately operated.

Is there not an agreed protocol between Bus &Eacute;ireann and the National Transport Authority, NTA, regarding local consultation where services are being reduced or withdrawn?  Is it not the case that if adequate notice is given to communities, it allows them to consider alternatives, such as the rural transport initiative or the encouragement of a private operator to take up some of the service?  Mr. Nolan is correct when he states that in some cases there are alternatives, and probably the best example is Dromad in County Leitrim, where there is a rail service.

I was also in Bawnboy yesterday in relation to changes on route 30.  We are engaging with people and trying to find solutions to these problems.

The committee has had a busy time and members may wish to move quickly to the question and answer session.  In the interests of clarity, however, I will highlight some of the important points.<\/p><p>  The NTA was established in December 2009.  It is the national body with responsibility for public transport - bus, rail and light rail - throughout the State.  We operate in five ways: first, we have a contract with Irish Rail in respect of the provision of rail services; second, we have assigned to the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, the management of Luas light rail services in Dublin; third, commercial bus services - such as those provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann, by means of its expressway service, Matthews Coach Hire Limited, J. J. Kavanagh &amp;amp; Sons and Aircoach - are licensed by the authority and are not the subject of State subsidy; fourth, we have contracted Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide bus services throughout the State in respect of which there are public service obligations and which are the subject of State subsidy; and, fifth, we manage the rural transport programme - for which we assumed responsibility in the past six months - throughout the country.  Many of the services relating to the rural transport programme are demand-responsive in nature and routes can be varied to meet people's requirements.  These services are also the subject of State subsidy.  For clarity, there are five sets of services throughout the State.<\/p><p>  The contracts we have with Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are extremely strong in nature and they confer on the NTA a number of weighty powers.  We possess, for example, similar powers to Transport for London in the context of managing the bus sector.  The contracts to which I refer contain strong performance requirements.  I recommend that members visit our website in order to see these contracts and information relating to quarterly performance reports and to targets that have been met.  It should be noted that 10% of the subsidy is reliant on the companies meeting their performance targets.  We can alter and amend the contracts unilaterally in order that the public might be better served.  All changes to these contracts are subject to approval by the authority.<\/p><p>  I will deal now with what might happen in respect of these contracts after 2014.  The contracts to which I refer are direct award contracts.  The latter are allowed for under European law.  Essentially, certain State operators can be directly awarded contracts to run services which attract State subsidy.  We are considering whether, post-2014, we should continue with the existing contracts in full with Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, whether we should open them up completely to tendering or whether we should open up some aspects of them to tendering and leave the residual aspects with those two companies.  As part of this exercise, during the summer we engaged in a public consultation process.  We published our consultation documents and sought the views of members of the public in respect of what we should do with the contracts post-2014 and with regard to whether new opportunities could be delivered by means of competitive tendering.  This week we are going to publish those views in conjunction with our summary report.  In parallel to this, we carried out a market consultation.  As part of this, we advertised in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union<\/i> in order to elicit from international and domestic operators their interest in tendering, the forms of contracts they would require and their views on the allocation of risk in such contracts.  The information we receive will assist us in determining what we should do.<\/p><p>  During an earlier session, reference was made to TUPE.  The latter relates to people's employment rights when a business or part thereof is taken over by another employer following a merger or transfer.  TUPE is a statutory requirement.  If there were to be competitive tendering and if this were to result in job losses in any of the State operators, the employees affected would be entitled to jobs with the private operators.  Such operators, if they won contracts as a result of competitive tendering, would be obliged to offer jobs to employees such as those to whom I refer.  The representatives from the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland, CTTC, indicated earlier that they are not so keen on the TUPE aspects.  However, our market consultation indicates that international operators have no issue with these and are well used to operating within the parameters set down throughout Europe in this regard.<\/p><p>  One of the key issues which emerged during the public consultation process is that people want integrated quality services.  Whatever we do as an authority - in other words whether we open up a portion or the whole market - members of the public want integrated timetables and information and they like Leap cards and real-time information displays.  One of the functions of the National Transport Authority is to manage all of these aspects centrally.  We have operators within those arrangements and these would all be protected, regardless of whether there was a full direct award or whether, as a result of competitive tendering, some other operators entered the market.  That is the position with regard to State contracts.<\/p><p>  The second major strand in the context of bus provision is on the commercial side.  We assumed responsibility for that function in 2010 and one of our first tasks was to prepare guidelines on how we intended to manage it.  We produced comprehensive guidelines which had not previously existed.  These were welcomed by the Competition Authority as providing a clear and level playing field for everyone.  They apply in respect of Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway services and to the private operators who have entered the market.  We introduced new timelines for our decision making in order to support the commercial responses.  I am happy to say that we have maintained the standards relating to fast decision making in the context of assisting operators to arrive at commercial responses in order that they can get their vehicles out on the road to serve customers.<\/p><p>  I would like to go into some detail with regard to the benefits of the commercial licensing arrangement and the constraints or limits relating to it.  This goes to the heart of the issue of the withdrawal of commercial services from particular areas.  There are strong benefits to the commercial licensing arrangement.  It ensures that there are satisfactorily insured and qualified bus operators are providing public transport services.  It also ensures that these operators are tax compliant.  It must be noted that the commercial licensing system does not undermine the State services we are subsidising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101700016#Q01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350470700,"counter":803,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Graham and Mr. Murphy and thank them for their presentation.

I will focus on the commercial bus licensing aspect.  Mr. Murphy said that he is actively examining the reconfiguration of nearby public service obligation, PSO, services.  He referred also to having advertised for a replacement service.  As I explained earlier, it is obvious from the experience in my part of the country, County Leitrim, that there are large swathes of the county - and the same could apply to across the west and the Midlands - where there is now a withdrawal of services by Bus &Eacute;ireann, particularly Expressway services, on which it does not get a subsidy and must compete with the private operators.  It was subsidising what was effectively a commercially run service, and now the chickens have come home to roost.  It cannot compete effectively and the reality is that it is now starting to withdraw from smaller towns and villages.<\/p><p>  Mr. Murphy said he is now considering integration under the rural transport scheme.  I believe the annual subsidy is about &euro;11 million nationally, which has been reduced, and there is some suggestion of further cuts.  Based on the map provided by the commercial operators earlier, in the midlands and the north west it does not seem to have any involvement in the provision of commercial services.  Will Mr. Murphy now have to consider a tendering process for those services that are being withdrawn by Bus &Eacute;ireann?  What will be the future for small communities across the more dispersed areas of the country?  This does not apply just to my area; it is across the country, because there is a gradual shift to the east coast.  What is Mr. Murphy's policy in that regard?  It is not fair, as one individual pointed out, to treat one part of the country differently from another part and to deprive the elderly, the infirm and those who cannot run a motor car of basic public transport.  That is the challenge facing Mr. Murphy, who is charged with overall transport policy in the country.  How does he intend to address that?  Will he consider, for example, opening up those parts of the country and putting the service out to the private operators who say they can run them?  At the same time, I suggest that the people using the existing services in the main have free travel passes.  The challenge for Mr. Murphy is commercial viability, and I am curious to hear his reaction to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101700018#S00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1350471300,"counter":808,"content":"<p>At a meeting with a delegation from Roscommon last week a question was asked about the withdrawal of services from Ballina to Dublin.

On the issue of value for money in tendering, which was raised by Deputy Dooley, there has been a definite growth in competitive tendering throughout Europe, and there is competitive tendering in Australia and New Zealand.  Various studies and reports have been done on the cost savings.  Generally, the literature indicates that there have been cost savings from competitive tendering, but the literature will vary.  It does not always come up with a figure of 20% to 30%.  It very much depends on the starting base; in other words, if there was a very inefficient internal operator, significant savings of 20%, 30% or even 40% might be realised in some areas of New Zealand.  However, in some other jurisdictions savings of only 5% were achieved.  That material is what we are currently examining.<\/p><p>  There is definitely an ancillary cost to the State if it moves from one internal operator to a number of operators.  The rule of thumb is that if savings of 20% to 30% are achieved, 5% of savings lost could be due to centralised control.  There is an issue associated with that.<\/p><p>  Public bus services can be smartly supervised these days because of technology.  With reports generated automatically from vehicle location information, we can quite easily run software routines to audit these.  The tools for supervision are much more sophisticated now.<\/p><p>  We would not end up with a disjointed network.  People have cited London.  London is unique compared to other cities because individual routes are tendered out as packages.  A team of 15 people manages this across the entire network, and they have a rolling cycle of tendering.  The end product for the consumer is the same: the red London bus with real-time information, integrated fares etc.  That is what would happen if there were competitive tendering here.  There is no way we would wish to create a disjointed network because it would not serve the consumer well.  Staff must be taken on at the same rates and with the same terms and conditions under Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment), TUPE, requirements.  I believe that captures most of the Deputy's points.<\/p><p>  To answer Deputy Ellis, the EU directives are mandatory for Ireland and they are further embodied in Irish law in the Dublin Transportation Authority Act, which states that where the authority proposes to enter into direct award contracts subsequent to the first ones - which applies to the 2014 contracts - it may do so only where it is satisfied that the continued adequacy of the public bus services can only be guaranteed in the general economic interest by entering into such contracts.  That is why I said this is a careful process for us.  We must satisfy EU law and Irish law.  In that context we have to ask if the general economic interest is served by direct award contracts, and if it is not served, what is the proportion that would be served.<\/p><p>  All the commercial licences we receive - which are not contracts - are scrutinised.  We create the equivalent of a planning file in a local authority in which we have the submission from the operator.  We assess the impacts, write a report, and then offer.  The operator can appeal the offer; we then appoint a different officer to decide on the appeal.  All of those files are compiled for each licence application in the State.<\/p><p>  I agree with the Deputy on the point about safeguarding the national interest.  The national overall public transport interest is our function.  We apply an even ground between the State operator and the private operators on the licensing side; on occasions we have been accused by both parties of over-favouring the other party.<\/p><p>  I will hand over to Ms Ann Graham, who will deal with Deputy Fleming's question on school transport services and the percentage of private operators of rural bus services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101700018#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350471300,"counter":811,"content":"<p>With regard to school transport services, it was indicated earlier that a very high percentage of bus services are provided by private operators.

The real challenge in this regard is the financial one.  In 2008, some &euro;308 million was allocated for the subsidisation of public transport services in the State.  The figure is now &euro;242 million.  Therefore, there has been a drop of &euro;66 million.  There is to be another drop in subvention, in the order of 12%, in the next two years.  This is why I contend that if we had the necessary moneys available, we would have the tools to remedy the problems.  We do not have the moneys available, however.<\/p><p>  We chose to tender the Durrow-Abbeyleix route but we had no subsidy available.  In looking at quality and the service response, we made a decision simply on the basis of the fares that could be collected.  The only moneys that were to be received were to be collected fares.  We chose to go to tender because we felt it might be possible to find an operator that could exist on the fare box that was collected for a limited number of services.  However, that could not be replicated in many of the areas talked about today.  We could tender based on the same principle but we do not believe there is any point because the patronage would be so small that a service would not be justified.  That is why we are faced with trying to reconfigure the services.  I do not have an immediate short-term solution for the committee.  We just have to work through the matter and try to reconfigure allied services effectively.<\/p><p>  Deputy Flanagan asked about the meeting with us and what we could do if Bus &Eacute;ireann decided to move every stop on its licensed services.  The answer is that we could do nothing.  On the question about the function we perform, I draw the Deputy's attention to my opening statement.  The commercial bus licensing system is not to resolve these issues.  One tool for doing so is State-subsidised services embodied in contracts.  The licensing system can only do so much - it can only regulate the commercial responses for the services that are commercial.  <\/p><p>  Ms Graham will refer to the rural transport timeline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101700019#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350471900,"counter":814,"content":"<p>In regard to the HSE services, in particular, many of the rural transport services already serve health centres and day-care centres.
