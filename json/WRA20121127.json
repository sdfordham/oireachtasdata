These include enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s pollution preparedness and response capability,\u00a0improving Coast Guard volunteer oversight, training and management, addressing deficiencies in legislation relating to maritime safety and addressing various measures to promote greater efficiencies within the services.

The funds will be distributed via the 34 city and county councils and the applications process is open until 30 November.  The key qualifying criterion is the ability of the event to attract overseas visitors.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Meanwhile, Tourism Ireland\u00a0has commenced a\u00a0major promotional drive for the Gathering\u00a0in markets across the world and has worked with business networks, clans, cultural and sporting associations, Irish Clubs and societies encouraging them to promote The Gathering to their networks and to mobilise members to organise events in Ireland during 2013.\u00a0 The second stage of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s strategy commenced in\u00a0autumn and will continue\u00a0into 2013\u00a0with a major consumer campaign to promote The Gathering Ireland 2013 in key markets including Britain, the US, Canada and Australia.\u00a0 Minister Ring, the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and I have attended events during the year to promote the initiative overseas.

If this express consent is not obtained\u00a0but has been inferred\u00a0by using default options which the consumer is required to reject in order to avoid the additional payment, then the consumer shall be entitled to reimbursement of this payment.\u00a0 While Member States are not required to transpose the Directive until December 2013, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation intends, subject to legal advice,\u00a0to enact Regulations giving effect to Article 22 in early 2013.\u00a0<\/p><p>  Article 6 of the Directive will require car hire companies and other traders, before the consumer is bound by an online or other distance contract, to provide information in a clear and comprehensible manner about the &lsquo;total price of the goods or services inclusive of taxes&rsquo; and, where applicable, about &lsquo;any other costs&rsquo;.

However, I also recognise that moderate and responsible alcohol consumption is not harmful and that there is no case for denormalising alcohol consumption in the way that was appropriate for tobacco.  Any measures introduced should be evidence based, effective and proportionate, and should have regard to the potential downsides that may occur.<\/p><p><br \/>  As I have stated before, I believe that a\u00a0legislative ban\u00a0on sponsorship would have negative consequences for sport and tourism.\u00a0\u00a0There are huge economic, social and health benefits accruing from sport. \u00a0From a health perspective alone, there are clearly\u00a0significant benefits for individuals and for our health system in maintaining and increasing participation levels in sport. One of the goals of my Department is to contribute to a healthier and more active society by promoting sports participation.\u00a0 However, it is important that funding is available to sports organisations to ensure that sport is maintained at grassroots level so that as many people as possible can participate.<\/p><p><br \/>  Also, it is my view\u00a0that sport plays an important role in diverting young people away from alcohol.  The financial support provided through sponsorship is integral to the availability of sport at grassroots level and I am concerned that placing constraints on the sporting organisations by eliminating the\u00a0alcohol industry as a source of sponsorship will have a negative impact on the development and availability of sport, particularly in the current economic climate.\u00a0<\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore, it must be recognised that many of the\u00a0major sporting events in which Irish teams compete\u00a0are international events and are directly or indirectly broadcast into the State\u00a0by foreign broadcasters.  Were Ireland to ban alcohol sponsorship, the only effect would be to exclude the Irish sporting organisation from sponsorship money while the advertising occurred anyway.  I also note that Britain, having recognised the failure of the 'Loi Evin' in France to reduce alcohol consumption by young people, decided not to ban alcohol sponsorship of sport for evidence based reasons.<\/p><p><br \/>  I would draw the Deputy's attention to a recent\u00a0<i>ESPAD Report\u00a0 on\u00a0Substance Use Among Students in European Countries. \u00a0<\/i>This report monitors substance use among 15&#8211;16-year-old European students in order to monitor trends within, as well as between, countries.

The programme is central to our foreign policy, has an enviable international reputation and enjoys consistently high levels of public and political support.<\/p><p>  In 2011 Ireland provided &euro;657 million to Official Development Assistance (ODA). This funding was directed to development programmes and to providing life saving emergency humanitarian assistance in over eighty of the world&rsquo;s least developed countries.  The majority of this assistance was delivered through trusted partners - the UN system, International Development Organisations and Non Governmental Organisations and Irish Missionary Organisations. <\/p><p>  Ireland also has long term, strategic development partnership programmes with a small number of developing countries, called Programme Countries, namely; Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia in sub-Saharan Africa, and Timor Leste and Vietnam in Asia. Timor Leste will cease to be a Programme Country in 2013. In these countries we aim to build government capacities to deliver the essential services that their populations need &ndash; mainly in the areas of health, education and food security. We also work in cross cutting sectors such as governance, gender equality, the environment and HIV and Aids, building systems of accountability that will ensure lasting development results. <\/p><p>  In Programme Countries, which are at the very core of our aid programme, Ireland seeks to shape and influence development in a way which will ensure that development assistance as a concept will be obsolete within a generation. We are witnessing human progress and growth rates in our Programme Countries and indeed in Africa, which would have been considered impossible only 10 years ago. There is, of course, much more to be achieved and there is still an enormous burden of poverty, but real and tangible progress is being made. Ireland has played it&rsquo;s part in this positive change.<\/p><p>  In 2011 Programme Countries received approximately &euro;180 million of which two thirds was delivered through Government systems at national, regional and local level. Comprehensive details of how Ireland&rsquo;s total ODA, including this funding, was spent is available in the Irish Aid Annual Report.

The remaining &euro;137 million (including Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU development cooperation budget) was overseen by other Government Departments. <\/p><p>Irish Aid provides assistance to developing countries either directly through bilateral assistance, or indirectly, through multilateral organisations. Irish Aid delivers bilateral ODA through a variety of channels. These include working in cooperation with Governments, local authorities, local communities, Non Governmental Organisations and international organisations. <\/p><p>A key element of Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral assistance is our support for long term strategic partnerships with selected countries to support programmes for reducing poverty and advancing national development. The Programme Countries benefiting from this support are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Timor Leste, Uganda, Vietnam and Zambia. The programme in Timor Leste will conclude in 2013.<\/p><p>  When deciding the most appropriate delivery channel for particular aid interventions, Irish Aid takes into consideration the stability of the political environment, the reliability, accountability and transparency of government systems and the existence of effective and accountable locally-based and international Non Governmental Organisations. In 2011, &euro;121.6 million (or 27% of bilateral ODA) was directed through Government systems in Programme Countries. The oversight, implementation and the impact of Irish Aid funded activities is closely supervised by staff based at our Embassies and offices. In addition, all proposals for Irish Aid funding in Programme Countries are rigorously appraised by Irish Aid staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as by the Programme Appraisal and Evaluation Group which includes external appraisal.<\/p><p>  In 2011, &euro;167 million (or 37% of bilateral ODA) was directed though Non Governmental Organisations including missionary organisations. Support was directed to these organisations following a full assessment of their capacity to manage and account for Irish Aid funds received and agreement about what results will be achieved as a result of this assistance.<\/p><p>The aid programme seeks to achieve a balance of delivery systems to ensure it remains effective. NGOs are supported because they work closely with local communities and groups. They also work closely with government systems in order to provide and supplement national services such as health, education and agricultural extension. Governments are supported because they have responsibility for implementing programmes and strengthening institutions that will have a lasting impact on reducing poverty. To achieve effective results in development it is important to work with NGOs, governments, local authorities and specialised organisations to bring about the lasting change necessary of development aid to become unnecessary. This is the outcome to which we are all working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700053#WRD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[52478\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700053#WRD03700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the amount of Irish overseas aid that was provided in development aid in 2011 and to date in 2012; the amount that was provided in emergency aid in 2011 and to date in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":208,"content":"<p>In 2011, Ireland provided a total of &euro;657 million in Official Development Assistance (ODA).

Ireland has no tolerance for fraud or any other form of financial irregularity in relation to our development programme. I have suspended approximately &#8364;16 million of Irish development assistance which was due to be channelled through the Government of Uganda systems in 2012. I initiated an immediate investigation into the misappropriation of funds by the Office of the Prime Minister which has been undertaken by a team from the Evaluation and Audit Unit of my Department. The team&#8217;s report which I have now published found that this fraud was very sophisticated and well thought out involving a high level of collusion at a senior level and that the level of collusion was exceptional and could not reasonably or<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>  normally have been anticipated.  I have strongly emphasised that Irish funding has to be repaid by the Uganda Government and that all necessary actions be taken by the Ugandan authorities to pursue those guilty of this crime. <\/p><p><br \/>  Our Ambassador in Kampala and the Director General of Irish Aid met with the Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance and Economic Development of Uganda to underline my deep concerns and to insist that the misappropriated funds be restored by the Ugandan authorities. The Government of Uganda has expressed their own deep concern at the impact of this corruption scandal on Uganda&#8217;s international reputation and has taken some concrete actions in response. The Ugandan Government have since confirmed that: all Irish Aid misappropriated funds will be reimbursed; that the officials against whom financial impropriety has been established will be fully prosecuted; and that measures will be undertaken to tighten their internal controls. <\/p><p><br \/>  I welcome this commitment and have directed our Ambassador to work with the Ugandan authorities to ensure that the misappropriated funds are refunded to Ireland. Discussions are underway with the Ugandan Minister for Finance and Economic Development and with the other development partners affected by this fraud, namely Denmark, Norway and Sweden in this regard. Our funding remains suspended until this issue is fully resolved. <\/p><p><i>Ireland&#8217;s aid programme is strongly focused on the poorest people and communities in sub-Saharan Africa and we have strong systems in place for the oversight and monitoring of our aid funding.  <\/i>  All of our aid programmes are regularly examined and evaluated to ensure we achieve effectiveness and value for money. This is done through: auditors based in our Embassies; the evaluation and audit team at headquarters; international accountancy firms whom we commission to carry out audits; the national audit offices of our partner Governments; and my Department&#8217;s Audit Committee - which provides an independent appraisal of Irish Aid&#8217;s audit and evaluation and also meets with the Comptroller and Auditor General and publishes an annual report on its work. However, it is clear that notwithstanding all these &#8216;checks and balances&#8217; that aid programmes through Governments and other channels in developing countries can be very challenging. We are currently examining our systems in all Programme Countries with a view to ensuring that they are fit for purpose and that there are no issues in relation to fraud or malfeasance.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am committed to ensuring that we learn from this to strengthen our systems of risk identification, management, monitoring and audit in the future to minimise the potential for the misuse of funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700053#WRD04100","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":214,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700054#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":215,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[52481\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700054#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on whether it is appropriate that Ireland continue to provide overseas aid directly to Governments such as the Ugandan Government which continue to propose laws that attach a person's human rights based on their sexuality; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":216,"content":"<p>The promotion and safeguarding of human rights, particularly those of minority groups, is a central element of Ireland&#8217;s foreign policy.

I am particularly concerned about developments in relation to the draft Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which was presented as a private member&#8217;s Bill, and is currently under consideration at committee level in the Ugandan Parliament.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland, together with other donor countries in Uganda, has engaged actively on this issue since it first arose in 2009.  We continue to advocate strongly against the adoption of the proposed law. Our Embassy in Kampala has consistently made the case to the Government of Uganda, at all levels, that the passing of any such legislation would be in conflict with Uganda&#8217;s international human rights obligations and would have a detrimental effect on the country&#8217;s relations with its international development partners, including Ireland. <\/p><p><br \/>  I raised the issue directly with the President of Uganda when I visited the country in July.  I asked our Ambassador in Kampala to continue to follow developments closely.  Last week, she and a group of EU Ambassadors outlined our serious concerns in a meeting with the Prime Minister of Uganda.  The official position of the Government of Uganda on the Bill is that it is not part of the Government&#8217;s legislative programme. President Museveni has made a commitment to engage members of Parliament on the implications of this Bill for Uganda&#8217;s international relations and reputation.  We, and the other international aid donors, remain committed to ensuring that the citizens of Uganda do not suffer violence or discrimination on the grounds of their sexual orientation. Our Embassy in Uganda will continue to monitor developments closely in the coming weeks.<\/p><p><i><\/i>Uganda is a priority country for Ireland&#8217;s aid programme, with a commitment to long term strategic assistance.  As with the other priority countries, our programme is strongly focused on the fight to end poverty and hunger among some of the poorest people and communities, with assistance channelled through government systems, multilateral organisations and NGOs.  We fund programmes through government systems in order to empower national governments to deliver and take ownership of the provision of services, which is essential if the improvements achieved are to be sustainable in the long term.  Irish Aid funding through governments is for agreed programmes in the social, health and education sectors, which are regularly examined and evaluated to ensure we achieve effectiveness and value for money. In the case of Uganda, as the Deputy will be aware, I have suspended funding of Irish Aid programmes delivered through the Government as a result of the misappropriation of funds intended for the Peace, Recovery and Development Programme.  This suspension will remain in place until the misappropriated funds are returned and we are fully confident that the Government has strengthened its internal financial controls and acted against all officials implicated in the fraud.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700054#WRE00300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid","counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700054#WRE00350"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[52482\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700054#WRE00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide details of all the non-governmental organisations that received overseas aid funding from Ireland in 2011 and to date in 2012; the amount each NGO received and the specific purposes for which this overseas aid was provided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":219,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s aid programme, which is managed by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is sharply focused on the fight against global poverty and hunger.It is recognised internationally for its effectiveness, and for its concentration on some of the poorest countries and communities, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa.

However, as the Deputy will know, issues related to the internal governance of the Irish Red Cross fall under the mandate of my colleague, the Minister for Defence, Alan Shatter, T.D.  The engagement of my Department, through the Irish Aid programme, with the Irish Red Cross is focused upon the work of the International Department of that organisation. <\/p><p>  Funding provided to the Irish Red Cross is channelled exclusively through the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) under a Partnership Agreement signed between Irish Aid and the IFRC, initially in 2010 and renewed again in 2012. Under this agreement, the IFRC allocated a total of &euro;800,000 to the Irish Red Cross for its overseas operations in 2010 and 2011. Of this sum, &euro;700,000 was provided in support of an ongoing livelihoods, food security and capacity building programme in Niger, whilst &euro;100,000 was allocated to health and education programmes in Malawi.<\/p><p>  In 2012, as part of the wider Partnership Agreement with the IFRC, the Irish Red Cross received &euro;400,000 for its activities in Niger, one of the poorest and most vulnerable countries in Africa. The programme continues to prioritise activities to reduce food insecurity, whilst also addressing water, sanitation and hygiene issues. A key element of this programme is to build the preparedness and response capacity of the Niger Red Cross and vulnerable communities, including through the implementation of preparedness and disaster management initiatives.  <\/p><p>  The International Department of the Irish Red Cross is small but effective, currently staffed by six officers at headquarters, including one part-time staff member. There are also five Irish Red Cross delegates deployed overseas in South Sudan, India, the Maldives and Niger. The Irish Red Cross also employs a number of local staff to assist in its operations in Niger, where it works in close partnership with the Niger Red Cross.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700054#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700054#WRE01050"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[52545\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700054#WRE01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide in tabular form, the number of staff in their Department, or in bodies which fall under the remit of the Department,\u00a0whose annual remuneration including salary, pension and benefits at 31 December 2011 fell into bands of &euro;400,000 and above, between &euro;300,000 to &euro;399,999, between &euro;200,000 to &euro;299,999 and between &euro;150,000 to &euro;199,000; if he will provide a breakdown of the positions held by the staff in the relevant pay brackets.","asker":"1037","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":229,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the table below.<\/p><p><table><tr><th colspan=\"3\"><div>Annual remuneration of staff at 31 December 2011<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>Number of staff<\/div><\/td><td><div>Grades<\/div><\/td><td><div>Salary Bands<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>None<\/div><\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;400,000 and above<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>None<\/div><\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;300,000 - &#8364;399,999<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td>Secretary General<\/td><td><div>&#8364;200,000 - &#8364;299,999<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><td>2  Second Secretary <br \/>3  Deputy Secretary<br \/>1  Chief Adviser to the T&aacute;naiste<br \/>1  Economic Adviser to the T&aacute;naiste<\/td><td><div>&#8364;150,000 - &#8364;199,999<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>There are no State agencies, offices or bodies under the aegis of my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700054#WRE01200","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[52546\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700054#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he\u00a0has made any contacts\u00a0requesting staff whose annual salary is in excess of &euro;200,000 in their Department or in any body under the remit of their Department,\u00a0to waive 15% of their salary or such amount in excess of &euro;200,000 whichever is the lesser; if he has, the date on which he first made this contact; the number of staff whose annual salaries were in excess of &euro;200,000 at that date; the number of staff who acquiesced to the request for the waiver; the number of staff who refused the request for the waiver and the number of staff who have not responded to the request for the waiver","asker":"1037","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>The Secretary General of my Department is the only member of staff in my Department with a salary exceeding &euro;200,000.

Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least &#8364;3 billion in 2011, &#8364;3.5 billion this year and &#8364;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their 2011 targets. The Head of the Credit Review Office (CRO), Mr John Trethowan, stated in his recently published ninth quarterly report that &#8220;&#8364;3.5bn of sanctions for each bank is a very challenging target, however the remaining five months typically show more lending activity and I am of the view that, after a slow start to the year, the targets will be a challenge but still may be achieved.&#8221;<\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputies are aware, one of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme. The Economic Management Council meets the banks on a regular basis and discusses the key issues pertaining to this priority.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to the lending targets imposed on the banks,<b><\/b>the pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets. My Department, in conjunction with the CRO, subsequently analyses the plans and meets the banks to discuss any issues of note. The banks also meet with my Department and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress. The monthly management meetings with the pillar banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by my Department.<\/p><p><br \/>  I should stress however that the Relationship Frameworks with the banks provide that the State will not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the banks or their management decisions including with respect to pricing and lending decisions. These frameworks are published on my Department&#8217;s website at <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i>.<\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of rejection rates from banks, I would remind the Deputies that the CRO can review decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities, including applications for restructured credit facilities, from &#8364;1,000 up to &#8364;500,000. The CRO is overturning 55% of the refusal decisions referred to them and I would appeal to SMEs and farmers who have been refused credit by the banks to avail of the services of the CRO.<\/p><p><br \/>  The overall target for lending to SMEs includes lending to the tourism, transport and hotel sectors. The Government is conscious that these sectors need access to credit. In his seventh quarterly report, the Credit Reviewer notes that whilst each banks&#8217; balance sheets have contracted recently, the monitoring of these figures show that no sector or geographic region has been adversely disadvantaged by either of the banks.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy should be aware that the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act provides for a scheme which will facilitate up to &#8364;40million in additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years.  Furthermore, the Government is in the process of facilitating up to &#8364;150m per annum of additional credit through the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme, designed for SME&#8217;s who, because of lack of collateral or because of the specialised sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing bank credit.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery. However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700054#WRE02950","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transport Costs","counter":256,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700054#WRE03025"},{"type":"question","counter":257,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[53075\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700054#WRE03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent if any to which he has had discussions with the private transport sector in the context of possible measures to address the increased fuel or other costs; if he expects to be in a position to identify any alleviation measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":258,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware a working group was set up between officials of my Department, the Irish Road Haulage Association and members of the Oireachtas.

adjustments made in as fair and equitable a manner as possible, while also seeking to minimise their negative impact on economic growth.<\/p><p>  The Deputy might be aware that the Programme for

The principle of breaking the link between the sovereigns and banks has been agreed by Heads of State and Government. In September the Commission presented legislative proposals for a single supervisory mechanism conferring powers on the ECB for the supervision of all banks in the euro area, with a mechanism for non-euro countries to join on a voluntary basis. The European Council discussed the SSM at its October meeting in the context of a report from President Van Rompuy on work being carried out on the Future of Economic and Monetary Union. The timetable set in the October Council conclusions envisages agreement being reached on \"the legislative framework\" for SSM by end of the year.   The imperative is to move ahead urgently to implement all of the important decisions taken on 29 June. I am working with ministers from the other Member States at the Ecofin Council to bring about the SSM. My officials are engaged in technical negotiations on the SSM proposal, the implementation of which is a perquisite for the ESM to make direct recapitalisations in banks. The Deputy is aware that the June Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Euro area stated that when the SSM is in \"place for banks in the euro area the ESM could, following a regular decision, have the possibility to recapitalize banks directly.\" It went on to state that \"The Eurogroup will examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme.\" <\/p><p>  The timeframe set by the October Council is for the SSM to be fully operational during 2013. It is important that there is no rolling back on commitments made by the Heads of State and Government. In that context I note that the President of the ECB Mario Draghi indicated at the Council that it would take 6-12 months to get the supervisor up and running. This is realistic and the final text should clearly confirm this timeframe for the full implementation of the regulation, with the ECB assuming supervision of the most significant institutions by 1 July 2013 and the remaining credit institutions in Member States by 1 January 2014 at the latest. My officials are working on intensive negotiations at a high level to reach agreement on the SSM proposal within the deadline set by the October Council. I share the view of the President of the European Council Van Rompuy that Europe must not loose the sense of urgency in taking action to stabilize the euro. <\/p><p>  It is anticipated that the single supervisory mechanism will be funded through industry fees and as such there should not be any budgetary impact. The establishment of the single supervisory mechanism is a crucial and significant first step to completing the banking union. The banking union will also require further work to develop a common system for deposit guarantees and an integrated crisis management framework, while negotiations on the bank capital requirements (CRD IV) should also be concluded as called for by the Heads of State and Government at the October European Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700055#WRF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700055#WRF01850"},{"type":"question","counter":306,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[52326\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700055#WRF01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the relevant contract tax continues to apply to school Board of Managements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":307,"content":"<p>Relevant Contracts Tax (RCT) is a withholding tax system that operates in the construction, forestry and meat processing sectors.

As such, the director is legally bound to act in what he or she believes are the interests of the separate legal entity that is the institution itself. To address the scope for actual and perceived conflicts between the fiduciary duties of the directors of financial institutions under company law and the wider public interest in circumstances where those institutions have received financial support from the State, legal clarity, not just to the role of the public interest director but to that of the entire boards of those institutions, was provided under Section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010. It provides that the overriding duty of directors of the covered institutions relates to the public interest as set out in the Act. Accordingly, public interest directors do not have a formal reporting relationship to the Minister or to the Department of Finance and therefore no formal report has been produced by them for either the Minister or the Department of Finance.    As stated in my reply to PQ 49478\/12 there are currently no public interest directors on the board of IBRC. However all appointments to the board of the bank are approved by the Minister for Finance under the terms and conditions attaching to the nationalisation of the bank. The Minister for Finance has extensive powers in relation to the appointment and removal of Chairpersons, CEO&rsquo;s and ordinary board members under the Anglo Irish Bank Act 2009.

This is because car servicing, including many of the goods and services to which Ireland applies a reduced rate of VAT, is based on an EU derogation under Article 118 of the EU VAT Directive, which provides that as we applied a reduced rate to these items on 1 January 1991, we are entitled to continue to apply that reduced rate to those items, provided the rate is no less than 12%.  Furthermore, while is it possible to reduce the VAT rate on car servicing to 12%, this could only be done through the application of a 12% VAT rate to all goods and services that currently apply at the 13.5%, and such a move would be very costly to the Exchequer.  However, it must be noted that in the majority of EU Member States, where the derogation under Article 118 does not apply, the servicing of cars is subject to a higher VAT rate.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, the EU VAT Directive does not make specific provision for a reduced or zero rate to apply to safety equipment in vehicles and potentially life saving technology in new cars, and as such they are subject to the standard VAT rate, which is currently 23%.

The standards established by the OECD are the most widely accepted standards by which countries assess their tax systems and those of other countries.    The OECD and the international community do not regard Ireland as a tax haven. The OECD identifies four key indicators of a tax haven: the first is having no taxes or only nominal taxes; the second is a lack of transparency; the third indicator is an unwillingness to exchange information with tax administrations of OECD member countries; and the fourth indicator is absence of a substantial activity requirement. None of these criteria apply to Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland has a comprehensive taxation system covering income, capital and indirect taxes and has Double Taxation Relief Agreements with 68 other countries. The January 2011<i> Global<\/i><i>Forum Peer Review<\/i><i>Report<\/i>   on Ireland&#8217;s legal and regulatory framework for transparency and exchange of information found that Ireland has an effective system for the exchange of information in tax matters and is fully compliant with OECD standards.  The Irish 12.5% corporate tax rate is a general rate for trading income that requires the trade to have real substance and activity. This rate does not distinguish between small and large enterprises or between enterprises that service the local economy and those that have a multinational focus.  Ireland is bound by the same rules on State Aid, Code of Conduct on Business Taxation, and rulings of the Court of Justice as all EU Member States.

A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits as well as profits from certain petroleum, mining or land trading activities, while capital gains are chargeable at a 30% rate.    Companies are chargeable to corporation tax on their profits after taking account of allowable deductions and reliefs as provided for in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Expenses that are incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade are deductible in computing trading profits, while allowances are available for capital expenditure on plant and machinery, industrial buildings and certain intangible assets used in the trade, with such allowances treated as a deductible trading expense.  Companies are chargeable on their net profits after account is taken of any losses they have incurred.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are certain reliefs available to companies, such as group relief and double taxation relief, which are standard features of corporation tax similar to those applying in other EU and OECD countries. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on corporation tax returns for 2010 accounting periods (the latest available), elimination of group relief and relief for double taxation would provide an estimated <i>nominal<\/i>   yield of &#8364;408 million and &#8364;618 million respectively, assuming no behavioral change in response to such a measure. Clearly, however, it would not be an option to disallow double taxation relief. This would result in a double charge, imposing a disproportionate and unreasonable tax burden on companies and would also be in breach of tax treaties concluded with other countries. The availability of group relief recognizes the fact that the operations of the companies concerned are closely inter-related and that the group effectively comprises a single economic entity.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are also specific tax reliefs for companies which are targeted at promoting investment in key areas of economic importance, including a 25% tax credit for expenditure on research and development, relief for start-up companies, accelerated allowances for investment in energy-efficient equipment, relief for investment in renewable energy and exemption of profits from commercial occupation of certain woodlands<font color=\"#0000FF\">. <\/font>Based on information derived from corporation tax returns for 2010 accounting periods, it is tentatively estimated that the <i>nominal<\/i> full year yield from eliminating these tax reliefs would be approximately &#8364;230 million in total, again assuming no significant behavioural change on the part of corporate taxpayers which would cause the expected increase in tax yield to fall below expectation.<\/p><p><br \/>  I should emphasise that tax reliefs are continually monitored to ensure that they are properly focussed, provide value for money and that there are no loopholes that could be exploited for tax avoidance purposes. Certain tax reliefs, such as the exemption for patent royalty income and incentives for investment in property, have been abolished or significantly curtailed in recent years as these were not providing sufficient economic benefit relative to their Exchequer cost. Also, where a potential loophole emerges or concerns arise in relation to unintended use of a tax relief that the Revenue Commissioners are not in a position to address under existing legislation, amending legislation is introduced in the annual Finance Act to protect the tax base and ensure that the relief is not subject to any abuses. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700057#WRH03600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":417,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700057#WRH03650"},{"type":"question","counter":418,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[52948\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700057#WRH03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the stance that he will be taking on the proposed action plan put forward by the European Commission to clamp down on tax evasion, through the agreement of a stricter definition of tax havens and the implementation of an anti-abuse clause to prevent double non-payment of corporation tax.","asker":"1048","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":419,"content":"<p>As the incoming EU Presidency, Ireland will be working closely with fellow Member States and the European Commission on the Commission&rsquo;s forthcoming Communication on Aggressive Tax Planning.

It is long established practice that Ministers do not get involved with its adjudication function.  However, I understand that the Tribunal received a claim from this claimant on 12th March 2012, under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007, the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 and the Minimum Notice Acts 1973 to 2005.  A notice of appearance has been entered by the employer and a notice of hearing will issue in due course.<\/p><p>  All claims are listed for hearing in accordance with their date of lodgement with the EAT.  I am informed that the waiting periods at the end of September, 2012, ranged from 9 weeks to 94 weeks.  The reason for the variance in these waiting times is because the Tribunal conducts hearings in about 36 locations. Where the number of cases is relatively small, the Tribunal may wait until a sufficient number of cases are on hand so as to maximise value for money.  Once a critical mass of hearings is assembled, 5 days of hearing in a single location can reduce the waiting time in the area concerned significantly. I have asked the Tribunal to examine if further efficiencies can be achieved through rationalizing their hearing venues.  Delays are also impacted upon by the number of postponement or adjournment applications made by either party.  I understand that the Tribunal targets areas with the longest waiting period and highest level of claims outstanding; using the resources it has currently available.  The Tribunal is actively working to meet this challenge, notwithstanding the high level of claims in recent years and the administrative resources available. <\/p><p>  I believe it is essential that we have efficient and effective mechanisms to develop harmonious and productive workplaces and to assist employers and employees to avoid and resolve disputes.  <\/p><p>  When I came into office last year I inherited a system for resolving employment disputes that did not achieve this. The system was frustrating for employers, employees and professionals representing them.  Notwithstanding the efforts of the EAT and others to reduce backlogs, I believe the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.<\/p><p>  It is for these reasons I am undertaking a root and branch reform of all five Workplace Relations Bodies.  The Reform Programme I have commenced will deliver a World-Class Workplace Relations structure.  I propose to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure.  This means that from next year two statutorily independent bodies will replace the current five.  We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.  All complaints will be dealt with by a single body of first instance where the aim will be to have a hearing within three months from the time the case is lodged.<\/p><p>  The activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court will be merged into the new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.  I fully expect the work that I have commenced with regard to the reform of the Workplace Relations Bodies, including the EAT, to significantly improve the quality of service to users including a reduction in waiting times.<\/p><p>  Since I announced my reform proposals we have undertaken two public consultation processes; published two policy documents; published a new website; introduced a single complaint form and single contact portal and commenced delivery of an Early Resolution Service.  In addition we have prepared the Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill and secured Government Approval for priority drafting of the Bill.<\/p><p>  I am extremely happy with the pace and quality of the delivery of this important Reform Programme.  It is proof that the public sector can be reformed in a way that can save money for the tax payer, while at the same time greatly improving services for users. The significant progress to date means we now have:<\/p><p>  A new single contact portal called &ldquo;Workplace Relations Customer Services&rdquo; dealing with all Workplace Relations complaints which has replaced the five separate entry points.<\/p><p>  - Complaints are now acknowledged, on average, within a week of receipt. This was previously taking up to eight months in some cases.<\/p><p>  - The employer is also notified, on average, within a week of the complaint being lodged thus increasing the possibility of a resolution being reached without the need for a hearing. Again this was taking up to eight months.<\/p><p>  - There are now no backlogs for Rights Commissioner hearings.<\/p><p>  - A Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use.<\/p><p>  - A new workplace relations interim website www.workplacerelations.ie is in place.<\/p><p>  - A pilot Early Resolution Service is now seeking to resolve disputes at an early stage without the need for adjudication.<\/p><p>  I am determined to progress the next phase of the reform and the enactment of the legislation with the same determination and priority that has delivered excellent results so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700061#WRM00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":653,"content":"<p><i>Question No. 339 withdrawn.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700061#WRM01000","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":654,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700061#WRM01050"},{"type":"question","counter":655,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[52514\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700061#WRM01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, the number of staff in his Department or in bodies which fall under the remit of his Department whose annual remuneration including salary, pension and benefits at 31 December 2011 fell into bands of &euro;400,000 and above, between &euro;300,000 to &euro;399,999, between &euro;200,000 to &euro;299,999 and between &euro;150,000 to &euro;199,000; and if he will provide a breakdown of the positions held by the staff in relevant pay brackets.","asker":"1080","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":656,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[52515\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700061#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he has made any contacts requesting staff whose annual salary is more than &euro;200,000 in his Department or in any body under the remit of his Department, to waive 15% of their salary or such amount in excess of &euro;200,000 whichever is the lesser; if he has, the date on which he first made this contact; the number of staff who acquiesced to the request for the waiver; the number of staff who refused the request for the waiver and the number of staff who have not responded to the request for the waiver.","asker":"1080","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":657,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 340 and 341 together.<\/p><p>The following table identifies the number of persons employed in my Department and its offices, broken down by annual remuneration including salary, pension and benefits at 31 December 2011 as requested by the Deputy.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance\/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies.<\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of education  , the Youthreach programme provides integrated education, training and work experience for unemployed early school leavers without any qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age.  There are almost 6,000 places available nationwide under the Youthreach umbrella.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) scheme, operated through VECs, provides a range of courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people over 21 years of age (particularly early school leavers). The most recent data indicate that there are almost 1,000 participants on VTOS who are under 25 years of age.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Back to Education Allowance scheme run by my Department provides income maintenance, along with a contribution to education costs, for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated in the BTEA in the last academic year.<\/p><p><br \/>  Approximately 10,000 persons aged under 25 completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2011 (excluding apprenticeships and evening courses). Training allowances on eligible courses exceed what a young person would receive in jobseekers&#8217; payments, providing an incentive to take up training programmes.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Labour Market Education &amp; Training Fund (LMETF) is part of the Government&#8217;s 2012 Action Plan for Jobs initiative.  The Department of Education &amp; Skills has committed &#8364;20m to fund a range of education and training interventions for up to 6,500 individuals who are long term unemployed.<i><font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font><\/i>  There are four themes to the funding, one of which is dedicated to the cohort of under 25s.<\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of job search assistance, some 17,000 young people registered with Employment Services this year up until September 2012, representing 37% of all registrants.  Registering with Employment Services gives job-seekers access to guidance interviews, job search assistance, and training courses, as well as self-service job-seeking options.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the National Employment Action Plan (EAP) persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social Protection and referred to Employment Services for interview with the aim of assisting them to enter\/re-enter the labour market.  Last year, there were 35,400 referrals of under 25s to the EAP, affecting approximately 25,000 individual jobseekers (those who do not attend initially are referred again).  Of those referred, 62% of clients had signed off the Live Register by the end of the year.<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>  For the first eight months of this year, there were 23,700 referrals affecting 18,300 young jobseekers. The EAP process is being changed on a progressive basis across the country to one where referral will take place immediately on becoming unemployed for those identified, through profiling, as being at greatest risk of remaining unemployed for long periods.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are a number of schemes\/programmes available that are focussed on work experience.  The most relevant for young people are JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme), and its predecessor the Work Placement Programme. Over 1,500 young people are currently participating on these schemes. The total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during its first year of operation was 2,600.   Young people will also benefit from the reduced rate of employer&#8217;s PRSI, the purpose of which is to support job creation, as well as from the impact of Revenue Job Assist and the Employers PRSI Incentive Scheme.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally the European Commission is currently reviewing relevant youth policies across the Member States with a view to making proposals for a European-wide approach to a &quot;youth guarantee&quot; that are to be discussed during Ireland's Presidency of the EU Council. The Commission&#8217;s proposals are expected to be published in December, and achieving political agreement on these proposals in the Council will be a major objective of Ireland&#8217;s Presidency in the first half of 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700061#WRM03000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code","counter":683,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700061#WRM03050"},{"type":"question","counter":684,"qnumday":351,"qnumall":"[52702\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700061#WRM03100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if there will be a derogation provided to her Department from European competition law to continue using post offices to administer social welfare payments into the foreseeable future; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":685,"content":"<p>An Post currently issues payments on behalf of the Department in respect of various social welfare schemes.

Within those categories, those waiting the longest will be processed first.<\/p><p>  While it is not possible to clear all claims in the backlog before Christmas, every effort will be made to pay as many eligible claims as possible in that timeframe.  It is expected that the backlog will be fully eliminated by the end of March 2013.  Claims which are approved by the backlog team will be backdated to the date of claim or the date of expiry of the previous claim, as appropriate, and all arrears due will be paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700061#WRM04400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Benefit Rates","counter":703,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700061#WRM04450"},{"type":"question","counter":704,"qnumday":357,"qnumall":"[52255\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700061#WRM04500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if child benefit payments in relation to multiples will be maintained; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":705,"content":"<p>Child benefit is a monthly payment made to families with children in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years.

In 2011 expenditure on FIS amounted to almost &euro;205 million in respect of some 29,000 families.  The FIS payment is designed to preserve the financial incentive to take-up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might be marginally better off in employment than on social welfare payments.  To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in insurable employment which is expected to last for at least three months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. <\/p><p>  There are a number of factors that would have to be taken in to account in any consideration of extending eligibility criteria for FIS to include self-employed persons.  In particular, there would be considerable practical difficulties in defining and controlling an alternative to the hours worked condition.  It would be impossible to establish satisfactorily a self-employed person&rsquo;s hours of employment and certify this on an ongoing basis.  Extending FIS eligibility to the self-employed would also need to take into account the fact that there are already arrangements in place to provide income support to self-employed people on low incomes, such as through jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and through farm assist for low-income farmers.  Furthermore, the cost of extending the scheme to the self-employed would be considerable and could only be considered in a budgetary context.  Therefore, an extension of the FIS scheme to the self-employed would in effect change the nature of the scheme and it would not be feasible or desirable to extend FIS in this regard in its current form.<\/p><p>  None the less, I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including the FIS, raises complex issues about the effectiveness and efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children.

Future use: Projects to oversee the future development and use of the PSC and its infrastructure, including possible use for on-line and financial services both internally and in other public service bodies.<\/p><p>  The first two programmes of work are essentially complete for issue of the standard PSC.  The detailed project plan to produce a PSC containing the Free Travel application (PSC-FT) and a variant suitable for issue to juveniles is currently being finalised.  The DSP&rsquo;s main focus now is on the deployment of the registration process throughout the Department&rsquo;s offices and rapidly increasing its ability to issue standard PSC&rsquo;s. <\/p><p>  A PSC is currently issued following a &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo; registration process which involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature, the verification of identity and current address as well as the capture of additional data such as answers to security questions to be used in ensuring the future integrity of customers&rsquo; data.  <\/p><p>  Letters which are issuing from the Department to a number of customers in relation to registration for their PSC ask them to bring proof of identity and evidence of current address with them.   <\/p><p>  The roll-out of the SAFE registration functionality on a national basis began in June this year, following recruitment and training of staff. The creation of a SAFE registration environment in a local office involves improving the technical connectivity, installing new equipment and training staff in these offices to support the registration process. To date, this process has been completed in 41 DSP Offices with 72 SAFE Stations in production and some 500 staff have been trained. The total number of Public Services Cards issued now exceeds 60,000. <\/p><p>  Work is continuing on developing the required bandwidth, installing the appropriate equipment and training staff across the remainder of the Department&rsquo;s local office network. In addition, a number of dedicated public services card registration centres are being progressed.  One such centre has already opened in Gandon House on Dublin&rsquo;s Amiens Street and others will start to come on stream over the coming months.  <\/p><p>  On the specific issue of the validity period of the cards, this was determined with regard to two issues in particular: the security of the data held electronically and the physical resilience of the card.  After receipt of external expert advice including comparison with other cards, the validity period for the PSC was set at 7 years. This initial policy will be kept under review and changes to it may occur depending on practical experience of the cards&rsquo; durability in the field.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700063#WRO01900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":807,"content":"<p>Question No. 393 answered with Question No. 356.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Application Numbers","counter":808,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700063#WRO02050"},{"type":"question","counter":809,"qnumday":394,"qnumall":"[52601\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700063#WRO02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the measures being taken to address the backlog of applications for disability allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"972","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":810,"content":"<p>Disability allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged over 16 and under 66.

FIS claims, both new and renewal, received on or after the 5th November 2012 are currently being processed on receipt.  There are 284 new family income supplement (FIS) applications and 340 renewal applications from the County of Tipperary pending decision since before 5th November.  An in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project has recently been completed for the FIS scheme.  This project focused on optimising output, improving customer service and the elimination of backlogs.  Part of the project was a detailed examination of workloads and a full assessment of existing capacity within the area and what capacity is needed in order to process the volumes of claims, both new and renewal, being received on a weekly basis.  The outcome of this review is a detailed plan outlining the process required to manage both the   continuous weekly intake and backlog claims clearance.  This plan sees the current weekly new claim and renewal intake processed by one team, while the backlog is ring-fenced and a focused team assigned to this work with a clear plan for its elimination.  <\/p><p>  The team, including additional temporary resources has been identified and is already assigned and working on the backlog claims.  In order to reduce the time it will take to eliminate the backlog, some claims are being processed outside of Longford Social Welfare Services Office.  This team is fully focussed on the elimination of the backlog of claims in the shortest possible timeframe, concentrating in the first instance on those claims which were previously in payment but where payment has expired and continuing on to first-time new claims.  Within those categories, those waiting the longest will be processed first.  It is expected that the backlog will be fully eliminated by the end of March 2013.  Claims which are approved by the backlog team will be backdated to the date of claim or the date of expiry of the previous claim, as appropriate, and all arrears due will be paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700064#WRP00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":840,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 409 and 410 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Redundancy Payments","counter":841,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700064#WRP00650"},{"type":"question","counter":842,"qnumday":411,"qnumall":"[52811\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700064#WRP00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when enhanced redundancy packages will be finalised in respect of persons (details supplied) in County Tipperary; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1087","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":843,"content":"<p>As previously advised, on the 7th December 2011 the issue of statutory redundancy was heard before the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) with 22 appellants seeking a redundancy payment.

It should also be noted that when the project closed, F&Aacute;S offered each JI Participant on the scheme alternative employment with other community employers in Tipperary including the retention of accumulated service and pay.

My Department will spend almost &euro;215 million in 2012 on the scheme benefitting almost 400,000 people. <\/p><p>  The purpose of the fuel allowance scheme is to assist pensioners and householders on long-term social welfare payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full. <\/p><p>  The allowance is &euro;20 per week and is paid with the person&rsquo;s weekly social welfare payment.  This allows the recipient to purchase whatever type of fuel they wish, be that oil, coal or natural gas.  Vouchers have been used in the past but such schemes, by their nature, introduce stigma to a scheme.  It is also the experience of the Department that voucher systems are administratively complex, inordinately costly and raise fraud and control issues.<\/p><p>  Given that the face value of any vouchers issued would be relatively small, the administration would significantly add to the cost of the scheme.  Such a system would have to operate across a wide diversity of fuel suppliers, given the range and type of home heating products available, including suppliers based outside the jurisdiction.  It would also require the putting in place of a separate administrative arrangement, adding further complexity to service provision for customers.  Issues would arise with the distribution, reconciliation and control of vouchers.  In addition, vouchers are easily lost and there would be much greater fraud potential, requiring more involved control procedures to minimise risks. <\/p><p>  Given the Department&rsquo;s previous experience with vouchers and the Department&rsquo;s current e-payment strategy, it is not intended that a voucher system will be introduced in connection with any aspect of the payments made at this time.

It seeks to achieve this objective as a result of various practical measures which will better support Gaeltacht families who are raising their children through Irish or who wish to raise their children through Irish.

This presentation will include the usage of a short video highlighting the advantages of raising children through Irish which has been developed by my Department as part of the Family Language Support Programme. While my Department is spearheading the programme, it should be noted that Comharchumann Forbartha Chorca Dhuibhne Teo. will play a key role in delivering this part of the programme in the Kerry Gaeltacht as part of their overall remit; and the provision and dispersal of information posters through appropriate public facilities, including libraries and health facilities, in conjunction with Kerry County Council, throughout the Kerry Gaeltacht.<\/p><p><br \/>  The content of the language support pack developed under the programme has been further developed.

Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.<\/p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known, nor is it possible to set out a definitive timeframe for the roll out of services.<\/p><p>  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland will have at least 30Mbps connectivity in the shortest possible time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700066#WRR03900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies","counter":985,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700066#WRR03950"},{"type":"question","counter":986,"qnumday":463,"qnumall":"[53695\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700066#WRR04000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding the number of new State agencies, forums and task forces that have been established in 2012; the number of new employees there are as a result of this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1104","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":987,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that I have not established any new State Agencies, forums or taskforces this year.<\/p><p>The Next Generation Networks (NGN) Taskforce completed its work in 2012 and the National Broadband Plan for Ireland, which was published recently, is informed by the findings of the report of the NGN Taskforce.

It also recognises the approved housing body sector as a key partner in the delivery of social housing solutions for low-income families and persons with specific categories of housing need.<\/p><p>  I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is framed in a manner which optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to just over &euro;333.7m this year and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities are now operating, a tentative projection of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units is anticipated for 2012.<\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies (AHBs) for construction and acquisition. In this regard, the Housing Finance Agency has received eighteen applications from AHBs for Certified Borrower status and awarded such status to five bodies, with a number of others currently being assessed. The Agency has approved six applications for 128 social housing units in total (at a valuation of &euro;11.6 million). It is envisaged that further lending will be generated for the Agency in 2013, under this Scheme, with more AHBs applying for Certified Body status and subsequent loan applications for social housing schemes.<\/p><p>I am conscious that the move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by AHBs to more revenue funded options presents challenges for them. I intend to develop an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it by Government and to underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions. My Department is actively working with the sector on the development of a voluntary code which I expect most bodies will endorse. This code, which should be finalised and agreed in the coming months, will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop a longer-term statutory framework that will best support the enhanced role of AHBs.   <\/p><p>Specifically u under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), funding of up to 100% of the approved cost is available for the provision of accommodation to meet the needs of persons with specific categories of housing need including older people, people with an intellectual, physical or mental health disability, the homeless, returning emigrants and victims of domestic violence. My Department&rsquo;s involvement with these voluntary and co-operative housing schemes relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects. The detailed administration of the schemes, and the certification that projects comply with the terms and conditions of the funding schemes, are the responsibility of the relevant local authority.   <\/p><p>In early 2012, some &euro;46 million in CAS funding was allocated to local authorities in respect of existing commitments on CAS projects then underway. In   July I announced details of a &euro;35 million programme of special needs housing provision which is intended to deliver some 377 housing units at 55 locations across the country. Approvals were based on local housing need and on the priority afforded to individual proposals by local authorities. <\/p><p>There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are working closely with NAMA with the aim of ensuring that a significant number of housing units are made available in this way by NAMA.   <\/p><p>Projected levels of activity in 2013 will be subject to the financial provision for housing, which will be determined in the context of the 2013 Estimates process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700067#WRS04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare Issues","counter":1049,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700067#WRS04550"},{"type":"question","counter":1050,"qnumday":489,"qnumall":"[52771\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700067#WRS04600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the review procedure that he intends to take with the Department for Agriculture, Marine and Food to ensure that the dog welfare standards being developed in the Animal Health and Welfare Bill will apply to dog pounds, rescues and dog transportation operators.","asker":"1103","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1051,"content":"<p>The application of all aspects of the\u00a0Animal Health and Welfare Bill 2012, including those relating to dogs, are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for\u00a0Agriculture, Food and the Marine. \u00a0My Department is responsible for matters relating to control of dogs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700067#WRS04700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Budgets","counter":1052,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700067#WRS04750"},{"type":"question","counter":1053,"qnumday":490,"qnumall":"[52873\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700067#WRS04800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the areas of the 2012 Departmental Budget both capital and current if any that remain underspent and which will either be re-allocated, rolled over into 2013 or returned to revenue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1054,"content":"<p>My Department is responsible for a wide range of programmes, including in the areas of housing, water services, environmental protection, local government services, and community and rural development. <\/p><p>The <i>Revised Estimates for Public Services 2012,<\/i>  published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in February 2012, detail gross e expenditure of &#8364;467 million on the current side of the Vote and gross capital expenditure (including carryover) of &#8364;895 million in respect of my Department in 2012.

Under Coroners'  Rules of Practice, as outlined on the Coroners website www.coroners.ie, all maternal deaths relating to childbirth are required to be reported to the coroner. The Coroners Bill 2007, confirms this by providing, inter-alia, in the Third Schedule on Deaths Reportable to Coroner, for the reporting of \"any maternal death that occurs during or following pregnancy (up to a period of six weeks post-partum) or that might be related to pregnancy\".  <\/p><p>  The cases cited by the Deputy are indeed tragic and we are all conscious of the anguish of the families concerned. However, it is the case that maternal deaths in this State are very rare and we have one of the lowest maternal mortality rates in the world. Where such deaths occur, they must be reported to a coroner who would normally require that a post-mortem examination be held. It is then a matter for decision by the coroner, having regard to the circumstances of the maternal death, whether an inquest is necessary to determine the circumstances. While an inquest would normally be held, there may be cases where an inquest would be unnecessary and leaving it to the discretion of the coroner is, therefore, considered to be the most appropriate public policy position.<\/p><p>  The Coroners Bill 2007 is before the Seanad having been restored to the Order Paper on my initiative.

Bullying in any form, including cyberbullying, may amount to harassment and may therefore be an offence under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, as amended. <\/p><p>  Section 10 provides that any person who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, by any means including by use of the telephone, harasses another by persistently following, watching, pestering, besetting or communicating with him or her, is guilty of an offence.  For the purposes of Section 10, a person harasses another where (a) he or she, by his or her acts intentionally or recklessly, seriously interferes with the other's peace and privacy or causes alarm, distress or harm to the other, and (b) his or her acts are such that a reasonable person would realise that the acts would seriously interfere with the other's peace and privacy or cause alarm, distress or harm to the other. <\/p><p>  A person convicted of an offence under Section 10 is liable on summary conviction to a class C fine or to imprisonment for up to 12 months or to both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for up to seven years or to both.  As I stated in the House on 7 November, my attention has been drawn to the difficulty which, it seems, is presented by the need to demonstrate persistence in the harassment.  As I said on that occasion, I have asked the Law Reform Commission to examine the issue and I await its conclusions.<\/p><p>  The offence of threatening to kill or cause serious harm in section 5 of the 1997 Act may also be relevant.  Anyone convicted of an offence under that section is liable on summary conviction to a class C fine or to imprisonment for up to 12 months or to both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or to both.  The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 may be relevant to some instances of cyberbullying.  The Act prohibits incitement to hatred on account of race, religion, nationality or sexual orientation.<\/p><p>  The Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 facilitates the investigation of cyberbullying offences.  It permits the retention of and access to data for the purposes of the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of serious offences.

Registration officers are members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na: in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, it is the officer in charge of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB); outside of that area it is the Superintendent of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na district.  The Act provides that a non-national is required to pay a fee to the registration officer for the issue of a registration certificate.  This fee is set by regulations made by the Minister for Justice and Equality with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is no requirement to consult with other bodies when contemplating a revision of these or other fees.  Moreover, it is difficult to see what useful purpose would be served by such an exercise as it is unlikely that affected parties or their representatives would signal support for such an increase.  The fee was first introduced in 2006 and was then set at &euro;100.  It was increased to &euro;150 in 2008 and remained at that level until the latest increase came into effect on 19 November, 2012.<\/p><p>  The introduction of the registration fee in May, 2006 resulted from a policy decision that the fee income was required for the ongoing development of immigration services - both in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  Our migrant population have made a valuable contribution to the economic, cultural and social life of Ireland and will continue to do so.  However, I believe that it is not unreasonable to ask those who benefit from the immigration system to make a reasonable contribution to the cost of services and particularly so in a time when we are seeking to reduce public expenditure.  It is common practice throughout Europe to charge a fee for immigration services; in some instances these may be set at a level above the estimated direct administrative cost of the service based on the value of the service.  By comparison with many jurisdictions the current registration fee represents very good value.  <\/p><p>  I am also very conscious of the need to maintain and develop good service levels to customers.  In this regard, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is undertaking a number of projects with the aim of developing and improving immigration services.  These include the introduction of a new common format EU Residence Permit for non-nationals which will replace the current registration certificate.  It will provide the user with a more secure immigration document including individual biometrics indicators protected by a sophisticated encryption system and showing the holders&rsquo; immigration status in the State.  This high quality, secure document will be easily recognisable for employers and Government agencies. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, INIS as part of its reform of in-country aspects of immigration services, is developing a range of measures including on line application and appointment systems for certain services.  Such a service is badly needed, but it costs money to implement.  The nature of immigration requirements such as registration necessitates, to a very great extent, the personal attendance of the applicant.  At certain times of the year this can give rise to long queues and significant delays.  A self-selecting online system will help to greatly alleviate these difficulties and the increased registration fee income will be used to meet a portion of the cost involved in this and other developments. <\/p><p>  Other projects being progressed are proposals for the civilianisation of certain port of entry functions at Dublin Airport.  For this purpose, a trial is underway at Dublin airport to test the feasibility of a new model for delivery of immigration services at ports of entry to the State by using a combination of civilian staff and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I refer the Deputy to my answer to D&aacute;il Question No. 171 of 4 October, 2012 which sets out the latest position in respect of this project. <\/p><p>  In recognition of the circumstances of certain categories of person, there are specific exemptions from paying the registration fee set out in the regulations; these are the following: <\/p><p>- UN Convention Refugees;<\/p><p>- Family members of such refugees who have been admitted to the State in accordance with section  18 of the Refugee Act 1996;<\/p><p>- Persons who are under 18 years of age at the time of registration;<\/p><p>- Spouses, civil partners, widows and widowers of Irish citizens;<\/p><p>- Spouses and Dependants of EU nationals who receive a residence permit under EU Directive 38\/04;<\/p><p>- Programme Refugees, as defined by section 24 of the Refugee Act, 1996;<\/p><p>- Persons subject to arrangements for victims of human trafficking.<\/p><p>The above categories of non-nationals exempted from the fee payment are almost 20% of the total numbers registering.  Last year alone, this amounted to 21, 443 persons and &euro;3.2 million in fees waived&quot;. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Policing","counter":1126,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRU00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1127,"qnumday":518,"qnumall":"[52744\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRU00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will request Garda&iacute; to provide with greater attention to a road (details supplied) in Dublin 13 to deal with illegal parking between now and year end; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1128,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the location referred to is within the Coolock Garda Sub-District.

The Legal Services Regulation Bill, therefore, sets out an alternative and more independent supervisory regime. <\/p><p><br \/>  As the Legal Services Regulation Bill approaches Committee Stage it is set to provide for the establishment of a new Legal Services Regulatory Authority that will be independent of the Government, the Law Society and the Bar Council in its appointment and in the discharge of its functions.  The Bill will also establish an independent complaints framework to deal with allegations of professional misconduct to which the public will have direct access - at present such complaints are made through the professional bodies.  There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners&#8217; Disciplinary Tribunal dealing with both solicitors and barristers.  These changes are being augmented by a more modern, consumer friendly and transparent legal costs regime under the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator that will take over the duties of the existing Taxing Master.  The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a set of Legal Costs Principles and the determinations of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, who may also issue legal costs guidelines, will be made public.  The Bill will also open the legal services sector to new business models that will provide new opportunities for legal services providers while also providing greater choice and competition for the benefit of consumers.  <\/p><p><br \/>  I continue to receive submissions in relation to the Bill from various stakeholders and these are being considered in preparation for Committee Stage.  Work on the details of the proposed amendments to the Bill is ongoing at my Department, in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel.  As I have previously stated, the relevant amendments will be made available in advance of Committee Stage, along with the relevant Regulatory Impact Analysis.  It remains my objective, notwithstanding the competing legislative demands of our EU\/IMF\/ECB Programme commitments - notably the Personal Insolvency Bill which continues to occupy Members of both Houses - that Committee Stage of the Legal Services Regulation Bill should commence early in the new year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRU03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Travel Area","counter":1160,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRU03250"},{"type":"question","counter":1161,"qnumday":534,"qnumall":"[52899\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRU03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the common travel area between Ireland and the UK still exists; if so, the reason passengers with Irish and British passports arriving from the UK have to go through passport control on arrival here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1162,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that the Common Travel Area remains in effect and that the continuing existence of the CTA is of immense political, economic and social significance to both Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It is of critical importance that both Ireland and the United Kingdom work closely together to enhance the protection of the CTA.  Indeed, It was very much with this in mind that I agreed a programme of action with the then UK Minister of State for Immigration, Mr. Damien Green MP, as set out in the Joint Statement on the Protection of the CTA.  It was signed by both sides in Dublin on 20 December, 2011.  The Deputy will recall that in the <i>Joint Statement on British Irish relations - the Next Decade<\/i>, signed by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister on 12 March, 2012 reference is made to the Common Travel Area in the following terms: &#8220;We remain firmly committed to preserving and protecting the Common Travel Area, which allows ease of travel for our people.  We will continue to work together on immigration issues, and to combat potential vulnerabilities from terrorism, illegal immigration and organised crime.&#8221;<\/p><p><br \/>  There is no requirement for citizens of either jurisdiction to carry passports when travelling within the CTA.  However, it is the case that airline carriers in many instances require their passengers to have a passport in their possession before allowing them to board aircraft.  As such, this is not an immigration requirement.  Unlike the operational practices at some UK airports, there is generally no segregation of arriving passengers at Irish ports of entry to the State.  Consequently, Immigration Officers performing immigration control duties at airports in the State do not know where passengers have travelled from when such passengers present at immigration control desks.  It is, therefore, necessary for Immigration Officers to establish where passengers have arrived from, and in order to do this, an Immigration Officer may ask passengers questions with a view to establishing their nationality and port of embarkation.  Once satisfied that a person is a citizen of the Common Travel Area (CTA) and that such person has travelled from the United Kingdom, the Immigration Officer will make no further requirement of that person. <\/p><p><br \/>  In circumstances where a person, who is a national of the jurisdictions that form the Common Travel Area, and who has travelled from within the CTA and is not in possession of a passport, an Immigration Officer, in compliance with their duties under immigration legislation, is duty-bound to ask questions designed to establish that the person is a national of the jurisdictions that form the CTA and has travelled from within the CTA and as such is entitled to benefit from its immigration arrangements.<\/p><p><br \/>  For the sake of completeness, I should add that border entry practices in the UK for CTA arrivals vary considerably from place to place.  For example, in some UK regional airports, police officers on occasion seek identity documents for passengers from this jurisdiction.  In other cases, evidence of having boarded an aircraft in Ireland is sought.<\/p><p><br \/>  In recent years, personnel at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and in the UK immigration authorities have detected abuses within the Common Travel Area.  Movements of illegal persons, suspected human trafficking, illegal immigration and substantial levels of social welfare fraud are among the consequences of such abuse.  The co-operation of all passengers arriving in the State, including Irish and UK citizens who have travelled from the UK, greatly enhances the ability of Immigration personnel, both here and in the UK, to prevent and detect illegal immigration and associated criminality.   <\/p><p><br \/>  It should be noted that in fulfilling their duties at the frontiers of the State, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilise a range of legislative provisions.  In particular, such officers will, where necessary, enforce the provisions at section 33 of Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1988, which states, an authorised officer, in the interest of the proper operation or the security or safety of an aerodrome, or the security or safety of persons, aircraft or other property thereon, may require any person on an aerodrome to-:<\/p><p>(i) give his name and address and to produce other evidence of his \/ her identity;<\/p><p>(ii) state the purpose of his being on the aerodrome;<\/p><p>(iii) account for any baggage or other property which may be in his possession. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRU03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Agreements","counter":1163,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRU03450"},{"type":"question","counter":1164,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[52900\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRU03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to enter into the Schengen agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1165,"content":"<p>The Schengen Convention is an agreement among European States which allows for the abolition of systematic border controls between participating States.  It also includes provisions for the development of enhanced cooperation in relation to law enforcement matters and judicial cooperation.  <\/p><p>  There are currently 25 fully participating States comprising all EU Member States with the exception of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria and three non-EU States: Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.  Border posts have been removed between Schengen area States and a common Schengen visa allows tourist or visitor access to the area.<\/p><p>  The Schengen agreement was incorporated into the framework of the European Union under the Treaty of Amsterdam.  The relevant Protocol recognised the fact that Ireland and the United Kingdom are not parties to the Schengen agreement and made provision to allow those Member States to accept some or all of its provisions at any time.<\/p><p>  Ireland has successfully applied to take part in certain elements of the Schengen agreement.  The activities which Ireland has applied to participate include police cooperation, mutual assistance in criminal matters, extradition and drugs co-operation.  Ireland also applied to participate in related aspects of the Schengen Information System -  a European search database which assists Member State authorities in carrying out border checks and police and customs checks.<\/p><p>  Ireland's application to participate in these specified articles of the agreement was approved by Council Decision in 2002.  In accordance with this Council Decision, these provisions will come into effect only after a range of technical and legislative measures have been put in place and successfully evaluated by the Council.  The measures which will enable Ireland to meet its Schengen requirements are currently being progressed.<\/p><p>  Ireland has not, however, applied to participate in the Schengen arrangements to the extent that they deal with the abolition of border checks.  This decision has been taken to maintain the common travel area (CTA) with the United Kingdom which remains a priority for Ireland.  The reality is that the common travel area could not continue to operate if Ireland were to remove border checks with Schengen States generally while the United Kingdom did not do so.  To do so would result in a situation where the land border with Northern Ireland would become the border between the Schengen area and the United Kingdom.  In such circumstances, land border controls would appear inevitable and this is obviously something that no Irish Government would seriously contemplate bringing about.   <\/p><p>  The Government's focus instead is on doing what it can to maximise the potential of the Common Travel Area as evidenced by the CTA visa waiver programme already introduced and ongoing talks with our UK colleagues on the possibility of a common CTA visa.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRU03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigrant Registration","counter":1166,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRU03650"},{"type":"question","counter":1167,"qnumday":536,"qnumall":"[52924\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRU03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that persons seeking visa renewals at the Garda National Immigration Bureau last week who were not seen because of the large number were told to return next week, however the charge for the visa renewal increased the following week from &euro;150 to &euro;300; his views on whether these persons should be penalised for insufficient staff available to deal with them.","asker":"1015","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1168,"content":"<p>The increase in the fee in respect of the issue of a registration certificate under the Immigration Act, 2004 came into effect on 19 November, 2012.

It is understandable that many people would have sought to avail of the lower rate in advance of the fee increase resulting in numbers at the public office Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), rising to exceptional levels at certain times.  However, I reject the contention that there is insufficient staff in the GNIB public office.  Indeed, there are extended opening hours in operation in the office from Monday to Thursday (8:00 AM to 10:00 PM); on Friday the hours are 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM.  Furthermore, as happens every year, special arrangements are put in place in September and October to facilitate the registration of students in major public and private colleges (who form the bulk of registrations in those months) as they begin or return to their studies.  Periods of time are set aside in the public office of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 specifically for registration of students which this year extended into November.  I understand that the bulk of students were in a position to complete their registration obligations in advance of the fee increase.<\/p><p>  In addition, it should be noted that in recognition of the circumstances of certain categories of person, there are specific exemptions from paying the registration fee set out in the regulations; these are the following:<\/p><p>- UN Convention Refugees;<\/p><p>- Family members of such refugees who have been admitted to the State in accordance with section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996;<\/p><p>- Persons who are under 18 years of age at the time of registration;<\/p><p>- Spouses, civil partners, widows and widowers of Irish citizens;<\/p><p>- Spouses and Dependants of EU nationals who receive a residence permit under EU Directive 38\/04;<\/p><p>- Programme Refugees, as defined by section 24 of the Refugee Act, 1996;<\/p><p>- Persons subject to arrangements for victims of human trafficking.<\/p><p>The above categories of non-nationals exempted from the fee payment are almost 20% of the total numbers registering.

During the same period, 757, 1,077, 1034, 1334 and 1,234 deportation orders were signed and a total of 161, 338 343, 280 and 246 persons have been removed from the State together with 529, 539 461, 475 and 387 who have voluntarily returned to their country of origin.

The increase in the figures in 2011 and in 2012 to date is mainly due to the impact of the Zambrano judgement which was delivered by the European Court of Justice on 8th   March, 2011.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the numbers evading deportation, it is difficult to produce precise figures.  Persons against whom a deportation order has issued may for short periods fail to report to their local immigration office but many subsequently do so.

The process can be a lengthy one often punctuated with judicial reviews taken by the applicants at various stages including at deportation stage.  Accordingly, not all cases fit neatly into particular categories.  For example, in the case of families, one member of the family may have lodged a judicial review which in turn may mean that the remainder of the family may not be processed until its outcome is determined.  In addition, some applicants may also be party to an application under EU Treaty Rights or through marriage to an Irish citizen or may have been granted leave to remain as a result of these applications.  Therefore, it is not possible to provide figures in respect of the remainder of the case load without engaging in a very detailed exercise which could not be justified as it would divert resources from case processing.  <\/p><p>  Finally, I might add that I recently approved an initiative to put in place a panel with legal expertise who will assist INIS in processing a cohort of repatriation cases thus speeding up the overall process and reducing the time spent by persons in the direct provision system. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRV00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Equality Issues","counter":1182,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRV00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1183,"qnumday":541,"qnumall":"[53036\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRV00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if any cases have been taken against the State, or any emanation or agency of the State, in regard to Section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Acts 2000-2008 which allows schools to offer preferential treatment in admittance of pupils of certain religious backgrounds; if he is satisfied that the provision has operated satisfactorily to date; his plans, if any, to amend the provision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"966","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1184,"content":"<p>My Department has been informed by the Department of Education and Skills that there is no record of a case having been taken against the State in relation to this provision.<\/p><p>  Equal status legislation aims to strike a necessary and appropriate balance between the right to the free profession and practice of religion, recognised by the Constitution and the principle of equality and has done so by providing a qualified exception, of limited scope, in Section 7(3) of the Equal Status Act 2000.

The Permanent Defence Force (PDF) support framework for the Reserve was, therefore, inefficient and the retention of the numbers of full time PDF personnel assigned to Reserve duties was no longer sustainable within a strength ceiling of 9,500 PDF personnel.<\/p><p>  A central recommendation from the VFM Steering Committee is for the retention of the Reserve with 4,000 personnel spread countrywide, based in PDF barracks and in 16 other locations.  This requires the consolidation of existing Reserve Units throughout the country into a smaller number of full-strength Units.  I accepted the Steering Committee&rsquo;s recommendations.  I also accepted the consequent proposals for new organisational structures submitted jointly by the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General.  These proposals had due regard to capability requirements and the retention of a broad geographic spread.   <\/p><p>  A new &ldquo;Single Force&rdquo; concept will see PDF Units having Reserve components, rather than a separate stand-alone Reserve as at present.  Reserve Units within barracks will be supported by their parent PDF Unit and the 16 Units outside of PDF installations will be supported by dedicated full time PDF personnel.  <\/p><p>  The fact that Clonmel was not selected is not a negative reflection on the quality or participation of the Reserve Unit in Clonmel, but reflects that it is not possible to retain all current locations.  I sincerely hope that members of the Reserve in Clonmel will continue to serve in an alternative Reserve Unit in another location and re-training will be available in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRV01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies","counter":1194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRV01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1195,"qnumday":545,"qnumall":"[53696\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRV01400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the position regarding the number of new State agencies, forums and task forces that have been established in 2012; the number of new employees there are as a result of this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1104","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1196,"content":"<p>No new State agencies, forums and task forces have been established by my Department in 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRV01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":1198,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRV01600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":1197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRV01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1198,"qnumday":546,"qnumall":"[52452\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRV01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide an explanation for the line on the October 2012 Exchequer statement that refers to FEOGA Intervention and which is shown as a total receipt to the State of &euro;720m to the end of October 2012, and if he will provide a statement on the derivation of the figure shown.","asker":"959","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1199,"content":"<p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine must initially provide finance for payments under EU-funded schemes.

In this context, one of the options under consideration is a change to the valuation of single reactors (with the exception of pedigree beef or elite dairy animals) such that single reactors would have a value assigned to them based on an extrapolation of the values assigned to similar animals in valuations of breakdowns where there are 2 or more reactors.  The advantage of this approach for farmers who have a single reactor is they will receive their valuation in a more prompt manner which will allow reactors to be moved off the holding earlier and consequently for the next test cycle to commence.  It would also eliminate the requirement for herd keepers to meet a valuer on a separate date to value their reactor.  This proposal would reduce the cost to my Department of valuing reactors by approximately &euro;230,000 per annum.  My Department is involved in a consultation process with the farming organisations on this and other proposals designed to reduce the cost of administering the TB eradication scheme and at the same time reduce the administrative burden on farmers.

The Council (also known as CORU) was established in March 2007 and is working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practise for the 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act.<\/p><p>  The first registration board to be established, the Social Workers Registration Board, was established in August 2010, and the associated Social Workers Register opened for receipt and processing of applications on 31st May, 2011.  A second registration board, the Radiographers Registration Board, was established on 16th December, 2011 and its register is expected to be established in the near future.  Three further registration boards, the Dietitians Registration Board, the Occupational Therapists Registration Board, and the Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board have been established with effect from 1st November 2012.  It is also proposed to establish the Physiotherapists Registration Board in early 2013.<\/p><p>  All the registration boards and their registers for the remaining designated professions should be established by 2015.  Under the provisions of the 2005 Act, there is a two-year transitional period from the date on which the register of the members of that profession is established, during which existing practitioners may apply for registration.  The Council which is an independent statutory body is responsible for setting the level of fees.  The current fee structure is as follows: A registration fee of &euro;100 for new graduates, who have obtained recognised professional qualifications within two years of applying for registration; An annual retention fee of &euro;295 for registrants, including those who paid the lower rate on graduation, is payable on the annual renewal date.<\/p><p>  All health regulators are self funding by way of annual fee income with operational costs being determined by the complexity and breadth of statutory functions specified in its legislation.  The greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged.  Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing, for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum.  Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the HSCPC is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions, which can add significantly to operating costs.  The twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 in the case of Clinical Biochemists to a high of 3,000 approximately for Medical Scientists and 5,550 for Social Care Workers, only amount to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions. is is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.<\/p><p>  The HSCPC is charged with extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act, registration being only one, and the annual fee of &euro;295 being charged is considered the minimum required to enable the Council to operate.  The fee charged by the Council, which is mindful of the requirement to become self funding by end 2015, is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases.  It is calculated approximately on the basis of the overall projected costs of the agency when fully operational divided by the total number of registrants and then further reduced to &euro;295 to take account of the Council's phased establishment.  The State is currently funding the HSCPC in its establishment phase (&euro;1.937 million in 2012) to offset the current shortfall in income from registration fees and will continue to do so on a reducing basis for the next 3 years.<\/p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fee, the HSCPC has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for controlling registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures: Where an existing practitioner with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, pays the registration fee of &euro;295 and is granted registration during the transitional period, also known as grandparenting, the application fee will cover them for the remainder of the grandparenting period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of grandparenting.  This concession will only apply to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act; the Council has requested the HSE to put in place arrangements for the deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary thereby spreading the cost throughout the year; Finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost effective operating system.  This will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRZ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":1431,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRZ02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1432,"qnumday":624,"qnumall":"[52222\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRZ02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the number of midwives working in Irish maternity hospitals in tabular form.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1433,"qnumday":625,"qnumall":"[52223\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRZ03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will confirm the correct number of midwives per mother working in maternity wards should be.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1434,"qnumday":626,"qnumall":"[52224\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRZ03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the number of midwives per mother in each of the maternity hospitals in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1435,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 624 to 626, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  There is no set ratio of midwives to mothers in maternity hospitals.

Within that statutory framework, all private health insurers are free to design their own health insurance schemes and to enter into agreements with health service providers.  As Minister for Health I do not have statutory powers to direct the VHI or any insurer as to what specific benefits are payable under any particular contract.  However, the Health Insurance Act 1994 (Minimum Benefit) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 83\/1996 as amended by S.I. 333\/2005) set out a minimum level of cover which must be provided by insurers.  In addition, the Health Insurance Act 1994 (Open Enrolment) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 81\/1996 as amended by S.I. 332\/2005) outline the waiting periods which insurers may require customers to serve in different circumstances, including in relation to pre-existing conditions.<\/p><p>  Cover for medical expenses under a customer's health insurance contract is a private contractual matter between the customer and the insurer.  If the customer is not satisfied with any decision made by an insurer relating to the benefits payable under their contract, they should first discuss it with the insurer concerned.  However, if the customer remains dissatisfied with the insurer's response, they may contact the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The Financial Services Ombudsman is a statutory officer who deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers. is service is provided free of charge to the complainant.  The decision of the Financial Services Ombudsman is binding on all parties unless the decision is appealed to the High Court.  Customers also have rights of access to the courts in disputes with insurers.<\/p><p>  Insurers provide a 14 day cooling off period where they will cancel a customer's contract and give a full premium refund.  However, I would advise all private health insurance customers to consider carefully the full range of plans and levels of cover available within the market before taking out a contract, so that they can be sure that their own needs are fully met.  It is important to note that once entered into, health insurance contracts are of one year duration.  Even if the customer is paying the premium in instalments over the twelve month contract term, this does not alter the contract in that respect.<\/p><p>  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) is the independent regulator of the private health insurance market in Ireland.

Such services are increasingly being delivered in or on the grounds of general hospitals.  Specialist Mental Health Services are, however, also provided in a variety of other settings including through day hospitals, day centres, respite houses, community and home based treatment teams.

The 2008 KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin Area report noted &#8216;<i>it is well recognised that for optimal clinical outcome, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services, or in the case of neonatology and fetal medicine tri-located with adult and paediatric services&#8217;<\/i>. The report noted that Dublin&#8217;s model of stand alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be co-located with adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new national paediatric hospital. Maternity and paediatric service co-location has advantages for infants with congenital malformations, for fetal medicine or complications which require neonatal surgery.  Maternity and adult service co-location has advantages for mothers in providing on-campus rapid and ready access to non-obstetric specialist expertise, and to specialist surgery and intensive care in the case of major obstetric emergency.<\/p><p><br \/>  In this context the proposal in 2008 was that the National Maternity Hospital be relocated to St Vincent's, the Coombe to Tallaght and the Rotunda to the Mater, and the maternity hospitals have been working with the relevant adult sites to progress this.<\/p><p><br \/>  There will be early discussions with the maternity hospitals regarding their maternity \/adult co-location plans in the context of the recent Government decision to build the new children&#8217;s hospital on the St James&#8217;s campus.  Notwithstanding this, I am committed to the intent of the report - that the Dublin maternity hospitals be located alongside adult acute services - while also bearing in mind the  need to plan for the provision of tri-located paediatric , adult and maternity services, as is the intention in relation to the new children&#8217;s hospital.    Management and delivery of health infrastructure programmes, including financing, is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. However, maternity service capital projects cannot be dealt with in isolation &#8211; they must be considered in the context of the HSE's multi-annual programme.  In prioritising capital projects within its overall capital allocation, the HSE must take into account existing capital commitments and costs to completion over the period.<\/p><p><br \/>  Work on the draft Capital Plan for the next multi-annual period, 2013-2017, is in progress and will be submitted to my Department in due course. My Department will then review the proposals and follow up with the HSE where further details may be required. The draft Capital Plan 2013-2017 will require my approval, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p><br \/>  My concern, with maternity services as with all health issues, is with patient benefit and patient outcomes. There is a real opportunity for the Dublin maternity service providers to further strengthen their relationship with their partner adult hospital at the earliest opportunity to realise clinical and financial benefits and efficiencies well in advance of physical co-location. We must use, within the acute system, our extremely limited health resources for the maximum possible benefit and to deliver safe, modern services.  Any decision on the future delivery of maternity services in Dublin, including the location of those services, will be made in this context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1476,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":1477,"qnumday":640,"qnumall":"[52366\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Cork will receive a hip replacement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1478,"content":"<p>Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he\/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.<\/p><p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1479,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA01050"},{"type":"question","counter":1480,"qnumday":641,"qnumall":"[52374\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the &euro;5 million allocated in the Health Service Executive's 2012 National Service Plan for mental health in primary care and access to psychotherapy services will be spent for this purpose in 2012; the date on which the 10 posts for mental health in primary care and access to psychotherapy services will be filled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1481,"qnumday":706,"qnumall":"[52952\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the promised investment of &euro;35 million annually in community mental health (details supplied)","asker":"1104","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1482,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 641 and 706 together.<\/p><p><br \/>  Funding from the &#8364;35 million special allocation for mental health will be used primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both Adult and Children&#8217;s mental health services.

The latest HSE Performance Report for September 2012 shows that the total number of patients waiting for a first time outpatient appointment, as of 18th October is 385,462, 71.1% of whom are waiting less than 12 months. <\/p><p>  Building on the work done by the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has now taken over the collection of outpatient waiting time data. Its methodology replicates the approach taken with the collection of inpatient and day case waiting times. The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format, revealing the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals, allows the SDU and the NTPF, in the first instance, to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.   Over the course of 2013-2015 the HSE together with the SDU and the HSE Clinical Programmes intends to radically reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. Key elements of this large programme of reform will include on-going validation of waiting lists, the systematic and standardised management of referrals from primary care, a reduction in unacceptably high &lsquo;do not attend&rsquo; rates and appropriate discharging from outpatient services when clinically appropriate to do so. <\/p><p>  A maximum waiting time target of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013, 26 weeks by 30 November 2014 and 13 weeks by Nov 2015 are the goals for the HSE and the SDU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":1492,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1493,"qnumday":645,"qnumall":"[52433\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the date on which a comprehensive set of supports will be in place for those affected by narcolepsy associated with the vaccine pandemrix; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1080","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1494,"qnumday":646,"qnumall":"[52434\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will detail his contact with the SOUND group dealing with sufferers of narcolepsy associated with pandemrix; and any commitment made to the group","asker":"1080","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1495,"qnumday":648,"qnumall":"[52439\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he will bring the package of supports for the narcolepsy sufferers arising from the H1N1 vaccine before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1496,"qnumday":667,"qnumall":"[52585\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding proposals for a package of supports for persons who developed narcolepsy as a result of vaccination with pandemrix; the reasons for the delay in bringing the proposals to D&aacute;il Eireann; when he expects to re-establish contact with members of Sufferers of Unique Narcolepsy Disorder; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1010","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1497,"qnumday":684,"qnumall":"[52786\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the date on which he proposes to put a paper to the Government on foot of the recommendations of the final report of the National Narcolepsy Study Steering Committee which concluded that the increased incidence of narcolepsy in children and adolescents here since 2009 came as a result of the a side affect of the Pandemrix vaccine administered for the H1N1 virus; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1053","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1498,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 645, 646, 648, 667 and 684 together.<\/p><p>  The association between Pandemic vaccination and an increased risk of narcolepsy in children\/adolescents is acknowledged in the report of the National Narcolepsy Study Steering Committee.

Levels of overweight and obesity have increased in the last 20 years, with a rise from 51% in 1990 to 61 % in 2011.  In men, the increase was 11% -from 59% to 70%.  In women, the increase was also 11% -from 41% to 52%.  In adults aged 65 and over, there has been a decrease in obesity, but an increase in overweight over the last 3 to 4 years and this increase in overweight can be seen particularly in men.  Almost 8 in every 10 adults 65 years and over are overweight or obese, compared to 6 in 10 adults 18-64 years. <\/p><p><br \/>  Recent data for overweight and obesity in the European Union (EU 27) compiled by the International Association for the Study of Obesity ranks Ireland as 1st in Europe for overweight and obesity in males (70%) and 4th for females (52%) <\/p><p><i>Children <\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  There has been a two-to-fourfold increase in overweight and obesity in children aged 8&#8211;12 years from 1990 to 2005.  Current figures show that 1 in 4 primary school children are overweight or obese and 1 in 5 teenagers are overweight or obese.  Girls are more likely to be overweight or obese.  The recent Growing Up in Ireland survey found that in children as young as 3 year of age, 1 in 4 are overweight or obese.During 2011, I established a Special Action Group on Obesity comprising key stakeholders and chaired by my own Department.  Its remit is to examine and progress a number of issues to address the complex and multi-factorial problem of obesity. It has long been recognised that alone no single initiative will reverse this growing trend, but a combination of measures should make a difference.  For this reason the Special Action Group is concentrating on a range of measures including actions such as: calorie posting in restaurants, the introduction of a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks, nutritional labelling, marketing of food and drink to children, the supply of healthy food products in vending machines, the detection and treatment of obesity, healthy eating guidelines and the promotion of physical activity.   When necessary the Group will liaise with other Departments and organisations in a cross-sectoral approach to help halt the rise in overweight and obesity  <b>.  <\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Procedures","counter":1508,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA03150"},{"type":"question","counter":1509,"qnumday":652,"qnumall":"[52472\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of weight loss operations that have been carried out by the health service here in 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; the number of hospitals here providing these operations; the waiting list for such an operation; the number of persons currently waiting on an operation for weight loss; the amount of funding in place for such operations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1510,"content":"<p>I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1511,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA03350"},{"type":"question","counter":1512,"qnumday":653,"qnumall":"[52473\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of patients accessing weight management services in hospitals here; the amount of funding that was provided to these services in 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; the number of persons on a waiting list to access these services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1513,"content":"<p>This Parliamentary Question has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA03500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":1514,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1515,"qnumday":654,"qnumall":"[52491\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRAA03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on whether the number and standard of ambulance vehicles and levels of medical staff available throughout County Clare is adequate to support the cardiovascular services available at Limerick Regional Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"977","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1516,"content":"<p>The National Ambulance Service is responsible for the provision of national pre-hospital emergency care.

Day services for adults with disabilities provide a network of support for over 25,000 people who have a wide spectrum of need, ranging from those with severe and profound disabilities who are likely to need long-term specialist service provision to people with lower support needs and greater potential for community participation and inclusion. The demand for services for those who have left school or training continues to grow and this year almost 700 school-leavers and training graduates required new placements. Disability services have been required to cater for demographic pressures such as this from within their existing budgets in 2012, which have been reduced by 3.7% in the current year. The moratorium on staff recruitment has also given rise to challenges in service provision and in addition the physical capacity to provide further services may not be present in all agencies. <\/p><p>  The training centre in Dooradoyle provides a training programme for young adults over l8 years of age with special needs. Each trainee is funded for a maximum of 4 years and receives a training allowance of &euro;31.80. Individuals with a disability in receipt of this allowance are usually eligible for the Disability Allowance also.  In recent years, on completion of the 4 year programme many of the young adults had no employment option available to them. As a response to this lack of available employment, efforts were made to maintain the young adults within the training environment and continue to pay them the training allowance, although on completion of the training course the payment of the allowance should have ceased. No additional funding was provided for this initiative. The funded 4 year training programme continues to be provided at the centre but the numbers are now at a point where it is not possible to continue to offer a 5 day placement and pay an allowance to the young people who have completed their training due to funding constraints and lack of physical capacity at the training centre. <\/p><p>  The HSE is currently in discussions with the parents of these young adults on how best to meet their needs. Options being explored include reducing their attendance time from 5 days to 3 days per week and the discontinuance of the training allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRCC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":1600,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRCC00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1601,"qnumday":686,"qnumall":"[52792\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRCC00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he will introduce a vaccination for Meningococcal Disease Type B; if he will outline the process for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1602,"content":"<p>NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.

The Scheme and its supporting regulatory regime were challenged in the courts by BUPA Ireland.  These challenges were rejected by the European Court of First Instance and by the High Court in Ireland. However, they ultimately succeeded when, in July 2008, the Supreme Court found that the manner in which the Risk Equalisation Scheme was implemented to be <i>ultra vires<\/i>.<\/p><p><br \/>  While the Supreme Court found the Scheme to be <i>ultra vires, <\/i>it is important to note that the Supreme Court decision did not strike down the principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover, nor indeed the principle of having a scheme of risk equalisation in place.<b><\/b>  Following the judgement, there was a need for a prompt response to maintain confidence in the market. It was therefore necessary to introduce measures in order to support community rating and ensure, as far as possible, that market segmentation did not become prevalent due to the introduction of plans aimed at younger, healthier lives. In response the Government introduced a temporary scheme of tax relief\/community rating levy in January 2009 which provides a very significant degree of support for the cost of health insurance claims by older people.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The Interim Scheme of Age-Related Tax Credits and Community Rating Levy was introduced initially for the three years from 2009 to 2011 in order to provide direct support to community rating. It achieves this by way of a mechanism which provides for a cost subsidy from the young to the old.  The Scheme was extended for a further year in 2012 under the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 and improved through the use of tax credits on the basis of 5-year age bands. This provides more precise levels of support for community rating than the 10-year bands which had been in place since 2009.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Interim Scheme provides that health insurers receive higher premiums in respect of insuring older people, but that older people (in six age bands ranging from 60-64 yrs to 85 yrs +) receive tax credits equal to the amount of the additional premium so that all people continue to pay the same amount for a given health insurance product. The scheme is designed to be Exchequer neutral and ensures that every customer has the benefit of a community rated health insurance premium. <\/p><p><br \/>  To support the principle of community rating, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place. This is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market. The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012, to provide for this permanent RES, was published on 18 October, 2012<b>. <\/b> The Second Stage for this Bill has now been completed and<b><\/b>  Committee Stage is scheduled for later today, 27th November. The main object of the Bill is to ensure that, in the interests of societal and intergenerational solidarity, the burden of costs of health services be shared by insured persons by providing for a cost subsidy between the healthy and the less healthy, including between the young and the old. The key measures in the Bill are<\/p><p>-  the provision of risk equalisation credits (payable from a new Risk Equalisation Fund (REF) administered by the Health Insurance Authority) in  respect of<\/p><p>-  the payment of private health insurance premiums by insured persons aged 50 years and over, based on age, gender and type of insurance cover.<\/p><p>-  each hospital stay involving an overnight stay in a hospital bed in private hospital accommodation<\/p><p>-  the payments from the REF to be funded by a stamp duty payable by open market insurers in respect of each insured life covered.  The stamp duty will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners and transferred to the REF. There will be four rates of stamp duty, depending on whether the policy provides for advanced cover or non advanced cover and whether the insured life is a child or an adult.<\/p><p><br \/>  The new RES will be operated prospectively by the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), with funds collected via a stamp duty by the Revenue Commissioners. In terms of financial arrangements, the main difference between this and the current Interim Scheme is that risk equalisation payments will be disbursed by the HIA rather than by the Revenue Commissioners. The rates will be set each year by an Act of the Oireachtas. The mechanism for assessing whether over-compensation has occurred will be the same as the mechanism which has operated successfully under the current Interim Scheme since its introduction in 2009.    The new RES will allow for a greater number of risk factors than the existing Interim Scheme, including a measure of health status. One criticism of the Interim Scheme, which has been in place since 2009 and which will finish on 31 December 2012, was that younger people taking out products that provided benefits below the standard level were potentially cross-subsidising standard level benefits taken out by older people. The new RES 2013 will provide for differentiated levels of stamp duty and health credits between higher level (advanced) cover and lower level (non-advanced) cover with a view to addressing this point.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The Government is fully satisfied of the requirement to provide for a permanent Risk Equalisation Scheme. I am confident that the introduction of a permanent Scheme, from 1 January next, along the lines proposed in the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012, will be one that is robust, fully operational and functioning soundly and will further strengthen and maintain stability in the private health insurance market, as we move to develop a new system of universal health insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRCC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1618,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRCC01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1619,"qnumday":692,"qnumall":"[52825\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRCC01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a young person (details supplied) in County Louth was refused their E112 application for assistance towards the cost of medical treatment outside the State on 13 November 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1620,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRCC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1622,"qnumday":693,"qnumall":"[52826\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRCC02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of E112 applications that have been received by the Health Service Executive in the current year; and the number of these applications that were refused.","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1623,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRCC02100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1625,"qnumday":694,"qnumall":"[52827\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700068#WRCC02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if patients making E112 applications are being refused due to a lack of funds to pay for treatment abroad.","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1626,"content":"<p>The HSE operates a Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS), for persons entitled to treatment in another EU\/EEA member state or Switzerland under EU Regulation 1408\/71, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulation 574\/72, and in accordance with Department of Health and Children Guidelines.

Bullying in any form, including cyberbullying, may amount to harassment and may therefore be an offence under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, as amended. <\/p><p>  Section 10 provides that any person who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, by any means including by use of the telephone, harasses another by persistently following, watching, pestering, besetting or communicating with him or her, is guilty of an offence.  For the purposes of Section 10, a person harasses another where (a) he or she, by his or her acts intentionally or recklessly, seriously interferes with the other's peace and privacy or causes alarm, distress or harm to the other, and (b) his or her acts are such that a reasonable person would realise that the acts would seriously interfere with the other's peace and privacy or cause alarm, distress or harm to the other. <\/p><p>  A person convicted of an offence under Section 10 is liable on summary conviction to a class C fine or to imprisonment for up to 12 months or to both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for up to seven years or to both.  As I stated in the House on 7 November, my attention has been drawn to the difficulty which, it seems, is presented by the need to demonstrate persistence in the harassment.  As I said on that occasion, I have asked the Law Reform Commission to examine the issue and I await its conclusions.<\/p><p>  The offence of threatening to kill or cause serious harm in section 5 of the 1997 Act may also be relevant.  Anyone convicted of an offence under that section is liable on summary conviction to a class C fine or to imprisonment for up to 12 months or to both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or to both.  The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 may be relevant to some instances of cyberbullying.  The Act prohibits incitement to hatred on account of race, religion, nationality or sexual orientation.<\/p><p>  The Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 facilitates the investigation of cyberbullying offences.  It permits the retention of and access to data for the purposes of the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of serious offences.  A serious offence is an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of five years or more as well as offences listed in schedule 1 to the Act.  The Deputy will note that the offences at Sections 5 and 10 of the 1997 Act meet the criteria and are therefore considered to be serious offences for the purposes of the 2011 Act.<\/p><p>  On the question of interpreting the law, the practice in this jurisdiction is that the Oireachtas enacts the legislation, the Gardai (or other relevant agency) enforces it and the courts interpret and apply it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700069#WRU00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigrant Registration","counter":1763,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700069#WRU00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1764,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[52729\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700069#WRU00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason for the recent increase in the fee for an Immigration Certificate of Registration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1109","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1765,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my reply to D&aacute;il Questions Nos. 153, 155, 156 &amp; 157 of the 22 November (below) which deals with the recent increase in fees for the issue of a Certificate of Registration under the Immigration Act, 2004. <\/p><p>   Section 9 of the Immigration Act, 2004 provides that a register of non-nationals who have permission to be in the State (in general for a period of three months or longer) shall be established and maintained by registration officers.

This fee is set by regulations made by the Minister for Justice and Equality with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is no requirement to consult with other bodies when contemplating a revision of these or other fees.  Moreover, it is difficult to see what useful purpose would be served by such an exercise as it is unlikely that affected parties or their representatives would signal support for such an increase.  The fee was first introduced in 2006 and was then set at &euro;100.  It was increased to &euro;150 in 2008 and remained at that level until the latest increase came into effect on 19 November, 2012.<\/p><p>  The introduction of the registration fee in May, 2006 resulted from a policy decision that the fee income was required for the ongoing development of immigration services - both in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  Our migrant population have made a valuable contribution to the economic, cultural and social life of Ireland and will continue to do so.  However, I believe that it is not unreasonable to ask those who benefit from the immigration system to make a reasonable contribution to the cost of services and particularly so in a time when we are seeking to reduce public expenditure.  It is common practice throughout Europe to charge a fee for immigration services; in some instances these may be set at a level above the estimated direct administrative cost of the service based on the value of the service.  By comparison with many jurisdictions the current registration fee represents very good value.  <\/p><p>  I am also very conscious of the need to maintain and develop good service levels to customers.  In this regard, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is undertaking a number of projects with the aim of developing and improving immigration services.  These include the introduction of a new common format EU Residence Permit for non-nationals which will replace the current registration certificate.  It will provide the user with a more secure immigration document including individual biometrics indicators protected by a sophisticated encryption system and showing the holders&rsquo; immigration status in the State.  This high quality, secure document will be easily recognisable for employers and Government agencies. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, INIS as part of its reform of in-country aspects of immigration services, is developing a range of measures including on line application and appointment systems for certain services.  Such a service is badly needed, but it costs money to implement.  The nature of immigration requirements such as registration necessitates, to a very great extent, the personal attendance of the applicant.  At certain times of the year this can give rise to long queues and significant delays.  A self-selecting online system will help to greatly alleviate these difficulties and the increased registration fee income will be used to meet a portion of the cost involved in this and other developments. <\/p><p>  Other projects being progressed are proposals for the civilianisation of certain port of entry functions at Dublin Airport.  For this purpose, a trial is underway at Dublin airport to test the feasibility of a new model for delivery of immigration services at ports of entry to the State by using a combination of civilian staff and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I refer the Deputy to my answer to D&aacute;il Question No. 171 of 4 October, 2012 which sets out the latest position in respect of this project. <\/p><p>  In recognition of the circumstances of certain categories of person, there are specific exemptions from paying the registration fee set out in the regulations; these are the following: <\/p><p>- UN Convention Refugees;<\/p><p>- Family members of such refugees who have been admitted to the State in accordance with section  18 of the Refugee Act 1996;<\/p><p>- Persons who are under 18 years of age at the time of registration;<\/p><p>- Spouses, civil partners, widows and widowers of Irish citizens;<\/p><p>- Spouses and Dependants of EU nationals who receive a residence permit under EU Directive 38\/04;<\/p><p>- Programme Refugees, as defined by section 24 of the Refugee Act, 1996;<\/p><p>- Persons subject to arrangements for victims of human trafficking.<\/p><p>The above categories of non-nationals exempted from the fee payment are almost 20% of the total numbers registering.  Last year alone, this amounted to 21, 443 persons and &euro;3.2 million in fees waived&quot;. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700069#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Policing","counter":1766,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700069#WRU00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1767,"qnumday":518,"qnumall":"[52744\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700069#WRU00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will request Garda&iacute; to provide with greater attention to a road (details supplied) in Dublin 13 to deal with illegal parking between now and year end; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1768,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the location referred to is within the Coolock Garda Sub-District.

The Bill, which remains a priority under the Government Legislation Programme, completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in February and is awaiting Committee Stage.  I have made comprehensive statements on the Bill and its continuing development to the D&aacute;il during Second Stage, at the Annual Conference of the Law Society on 14 of April, and at the conference hosted by my Department on <i>Regulatory Reform for a 21st Century Legal Profession<\/i>  that took place on 6 July.  The full text of these statements is available on the Department website, www.justice.ie, for ease of reference.  During the Second Stage debate I also recalled to the House the decision taken in May 2011 not to proceed with the appointment of a Legal Services Ombudsman.  This is because the oversight model proposed in the Legal Services Ombudsman Act of 2009 does not meet this Government&#8217;s policy commitment to greater independence in the regulation of the legal professions.  The Legal Services Regulation Bill, therefore, sets out an alternative and more independent supervisory regime. <\/p><p><br \/>  As the Legal Services Regulation Bill approaches Committee Stage it is set to provide for the establishment of a new Legal Services Regulatory Authority that will be independent of the Government, the Law Society and the Bar Council in its appointment and in the discharge of its functions.  The Bill will also establish an independent complaints framework to deal with allegations of professional misconduct to which the public will have direct access - at present such complaints are made through the professional bodies.  There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners&#8217; Disciplinary Tribunal dealing with both solicitors and barristers.  These changes are being augmented by a more modern, consumer friendly and transparent legal costs regime under the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator that will take over the duties of the existing Taxing Master.  The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a set of Legal Costs Principles and the determinations of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, who may also issue legal costs guidelines, will be made public.  The Bill will also open the legal services sector to new business models that will provide new opportunities for legal services providers while also providing greater choice and competition for the benefit of consumers.  <\/p><p><br \/>  I continue to receive submissions in relation to the Bill from various stakeholders and these are being considered in preparation for Committee Stage.

It is of critical importance that both Ireland and the United Kingdom work closely together to enhance the protection of the CTA.  Indeed, It was very much with this in mind that I agreed a programme of action with the then UK Minister of State for Immigration, Mr. Damien Green MP, as set out in the Joint Statement on the Protection of the CTA.  It was signed by both sides in Dublin on 20 December, 2011.  The Deputy will recall that in the <i>Joint Statement on British Irish relations - the Next Decade<\/i>, signed by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister on 12 March, 2012 reference is made to the Common Travel Area in the following terms: &#8220;We remain firmly committed to preserving and protecting the Common Travel Area, which allows ease of travel for our people.  We will continue to work together on immigration issues, and to combat potential vulnerabilities from terrorism, illegal immigration and organised crime.&#8221;<\/p><p><br \/>  There is no requirement for citizens of either jurisdiction to carry passports when travelling within the CTA.  However, it is the case that airline carriers in many instances require their passengers to have a passport in their possession before allowing them to board aircraft.  As such, this is not an immigration requirement.  Unlike the operational practices at some UK airports, there is generally no segregation of arriving passengers at Irish ports of entry to the State.  Consequently, Immigration Officers performing immigration control duties at airports in the State do not know where passengers have travelled from when such passengers present at immigration control desks.  It is, therefore, necessary for Immigration Officers to establish where passengers have arrived from, and in order to do this, an Immigration Officer may ask passengers questions with a view to establishing their nationality and port of embarkation.  Once satisfied that a person is a citizen of the Common Travel Area (CTA) and that such person has travelled from the United Kingdom, the Immigration Officer will make no further requirement of that person. <\/p><p><br \/>  In circumstances where a person, who is a national of the jurisdictions that form the Common Travel Area, and who has travelled from within the CTA and is not in possession of a passport, an Immigration Officer, in compliance with their duties under immigration legislation, is duty-bound to ask questions designed to establish that the person is a national of the jurisdictions that form the CTA and has travelled from within the CTA and as such is entitled to benefit from its immigration arrangements.<\/p><p><br \/>  For the sake of completeness, I should add that border entry practices in the UK for CTA arrivals vary considerably from place to place.  For example, in some UK regional airports, police officers on occasion seek identity documents for passengers from this jurisdiction.  In other cases, evidence of having boarded an aircraft in Ireland is sought.<\/p><p><br \/>  In recent years, personnel at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and in the UK immigration authorities have detected abuses within the Common Travel Area.  Movements of illegal persons, suspected human trafficking, illegal immigration and substantial levels of social welfare fraud are among the consequences of such abuse.  The co-operation of all passengers arriving in the State, including Irish and UK citizens who have travelled from the UK, greatly enhances the ability of Immigration personnel, both here and in the UK, to prevent and detect illegal immigration and associated criminality.   <\/p><p><br \/>  It should be noted that in fulfilling their duties at the frontiers of the State, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilise a range of legislative provisions.  In particular, such officers will, where necessary, enforce the provisions at section 33 of Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1988, which states, an authorised officer, in the interest of the proper operation or the security or safety of an aerodrome, or the security or safety of persons, aircraft or other property thereon, may require any person on an aerodrome to-:<\/p><p>(i) give his name and address and to produce other evidence of his \/ her identity;<\/p><p>(ii) state the purpose of his being on the aerodrome;<\/p><p>(iii) account for any baggage or other property which may be in his possession. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700069#WRU03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Agreements","counter":1803,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700069#WRU03450"},{"type":"question","counter":1804,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[52900\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700069#WRU03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to enter into the Schengen agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1805,"content":"<p>The Schengen Convention is an agreement among European States which allows for the abolition of systematic border controls between participating States.  It also includes provisions for the development of enhanced cooperation in relation to law enforcement matters and judicial cooperation.  <\/p><p>  There are currently 25 fully participating States comprising all EU Member States with the exception of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria and three non-EU States: Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.  Border posts have been removed between Schengen area States and a common Schengen visa allows tourist or visitor access to the area.<\/p><p>  The Schengen agreement was incorporated into the framework of the European Union under the Treaty of Amsterdam.  The relevant Protocol recognised the fact that Ireland and the United Kingdom are not parties to the Schengen agreement and made provision to allow those Member States to accept some or all of its provisions at any time.<\/p><p>  Ireland has successfully applied to take part in certain elements of the Schengen agreement.  The activities which Ireland has applied to participate include police cooperation, mutual assistance in criminal matters, extradition and drugs co-operation.  Ireland also applied to participate in related aspects of the Schengen Information System -  a European search database which assists Member State authorities in carrying out border checks and police and customs checks.<\/p><p>  Ireland's application to participate in these specified articles of the agreement was approved by Council Decision in 2002.  In accordance with this Council Decision, these provisions will come into effect only after a range of technical and legislative measures have been put in place and successfully evaluated by the Council.  The measures which will enable Ireland to meet its Schengen requirements are currently being progressed.<\/p><p>  Ireland has not, however, applied to participate in the Schengen arrangements to the extent that they deal with the abolition of border checks.  This decision has been taken to maintain the common travel area (CTA) with the United Kingdom which remains a priority for Ireland.  The reality is that the common travel area could not continue to operate if Ireland were to remove border checks with Schengen States generally while the United Kingdom did not do so.  To do so would result in a situation where the land border with Northern Ireland would become the border between the Schengen area and the United Kingdom.  In such circumstances, land border controls would appear inevitable and this is obviously something that no Irish Government would seriously contemplate bringing about.   <\/p><p>  The Government's focus instead is on doing what it can to maximise the potential of the Common Travel Area as evidenced by the CTA visa waiver programme already introduced and ongoing talks with our UK colleagues on the possibility of a common CTA visa.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700069#WRU03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigrant Registration","counter":1806,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700069#WRU03650"},{"type":"question","counter":1807,"qnumday":536,"qnumall":"[52924\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700069#WRU03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that persons seeking visa renewals at the Garda National Immigration Bureau last week who were not seen because of the large number were told to return next week, however the charge for the visa renewal increased the following week from &euro;150 to &euro;300; his views on whether these persons should be penalised for insufficient staff available to deal with them.","asker":"1015","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1808,"content":"<p>The increase in the fee in respect of the issue of a registration certificate under the Immigration Act, 2004 came into effect on 19 November, 2012.

It is understandable that many people would have sought to avail of the lower rate in advance of the fee increase resulting in numbers at the public office Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), rising to exceptional levels at certain times.  However, I reject the contention that there is insufficient staff in the GNIB public office.  Indeed, there are extended opening hours in operation in the office from Monday to Thursday (8:00 AM to 10:00 PM); on Friday the hours are 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM.  Furthermore, as happens every year, special arrangements are put in place in September and October to facilitate the registration of students in major public and private colleges (who form the bulk of registrations in those months) as they begin or return to their studies.  Periods of time are set aside in the public office of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 specifically for registration of students which this year extended into November.

During the same period, 757, 1,077, 1034, 1334 and 1,234 deportation orders were signed and a total of 161, 338 343, 280 and 246 persons have been removed from the State together with 529, 539 461, 475 and 387 who have voluntarily returned to their country of origin.

The increase in the figures in 2011 and in 2012 to date is mainly due to the impact of the Zambrano judgement which was delivered by the European Court of Justice on 8th   March, 2011.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the numbers evading deportation, it is difficult to produce precise figures.  Persons against whom a deportation order has issued may for short periods fail to report to their local immigration office but many subsequently do so.  In addition, I am informed that a significant number of persons who are the subject of a Deportation Order will have left the jurisdiction.  <\/p><p>  The processing of cases at the repatriation stage is a complex one with obligations to adhere to both domestic and international law and to make decisions in accordance with the UN Convention on Human Rights.   The process can be a lengthy one often punctuated with judicial reviews taken by the applicants at various stages including at deportation stage.  Accordingly, not all cases fit neatly into particular categories.  For example, in the case of families, one member of the family may have lodged a judicial review which in turn may mean that the remainder of the family may not be processed until its outcome is determined.  In addition, some applicants may also be party to an application under EU Treaty Rights or through marriage to an Irish citizen or may have been granted leave to remain as a result of these applications.  Therefore, it is not possible to provide figures in respect of the remainder of the case load without engaging in a very detailed exercise which could not be justified as it would divert resources from case processing.  <\/p><p>  Finally, I might add that I recently approved an initiative to put in place a panel with legal expertise who will assist INIS in processing a cohort of repatriation cases thus speeding up the overall process and reducing the time spent by persons in the direct provision system. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700070#WRV00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Equality Issues","counter":1822,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700070#WRV00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1823,"qnumday":541,"qnumall":"[53036\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700070#WRV00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if any cases have been taken against the State, or any emanation or agency of the State, in regard to Section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Acts 2000-2008 which allows schools to offer preferential treatment in admittance of pupils of certain religious backgrounds; if he is satisfied that the provision has operated satisfactorily to date; his plans, if any, to amend the provision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"966","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1824,"content":"<p>My Department has been informed by the Department of Education and Skills that there is no record of a case having been taken against the State in relation to this provision.<\/p><p>  Equal status legislation aims to strike a necessary and appropriate balance between the right to the free profession and practice of religion, recognised by the Constitution and the principle of equality and has done so by providing a qualified exception, of limited scope, in Section 7(3) of the Equal Status Act 2000.

In this context, one of the options under consideration is a change to the valuation of single reactors (with the exception of pedigree beef or elite dairy animals) such that single reactors would have a value assigned to them based on an extrapolation of the values assigned to similar animals in valuations of breakdowns where there are 2 or more reactors.  The advantage of this approach for farmers who have a single reactor is they will receive their valuation in a more prompt manner which will allow reactors to be moved off the holding earlier and consequently for the next test cycle to commence.  It would also eliminate the requirement for herd keepers to meet a valuer on a separate date to value their reactor.  This proposal would reduce the cost to my Department of valuing reactors by approximately &euro;230,000 per annum.  My Department is involved in a consultation process with the farming organisations on this and other proposals designed to reduce the cost of administering the TB eradication scheme and at the same time reduce the administrative burden on farmers.

The Council (also known as CORU) was established in March 2007 and is working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practise for the 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act.<\/p><p>  The first registration board to be established, the Social Workers Registration Board, was established in August 2010, and the associated Social Workers Register opened for receipt and processing of applications on 31st May, 2011.  A second registration board, the Radiographers Registration Board, was established on 16th December, 2011 and its register is expected to be established in the near future.  Three further registration boards, the Dietitians Registration Board, the Occupational Therapists Registration Board, and the Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board have been established with effect from 1st November 2012.  It is also proposed to establish the Physiotherapists Registration Board in early 2013.<\/p><p>  All the registration boards and their registers for the remaining designated professions should be established by 2015.  Under the provisions of the 2005 Act, there is a two-year transitional period from the date on which the register of the members of that profession is established, during which existing practitioners may apply for registration.  The Council which is an independent statutory body is responsible for setting the level of fees.  The current fee structure is as follows: A registration fee of &euro;100 for new graduates, who have obtained recognised professional qualifications within two years of applying for registration; An annual retention fee of &euro;295 for registrants, including those who paid the lower rate on graduation, is payable on the annual renewal date.<\/p><p>  All health regulators are self funding by way of annual fee income with operational costs being determined by the complexity and breadth of statutory functions specified in its legislation.  The greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged.  Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing, for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum.  Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the HSCPC is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions, which can add significantly to operating costs.  The twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 in the case of Clinical Biochemists to a high of 3,000 approximately for Medical Scientists and 5,550 for Social Care Workers, only amount to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions. is is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.<\/p><p>  The HSCPC is charged with extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act, registration being only one, and the annual fee of &euro;295 being charged is considered the minimum required to enable the Council to operate.  The fee charged by the Council, which is mindful of the requirement to become self funding by end 2015, is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases.  It is calculated approximately on the basis of the overall projected costs of the agency when fully operational divided by the total number of registrants and then further reduced to &euro;295 to take account of the Council's phased establishment.  The State is currently funding the HSCPC in its establishment phase (&euro;1.937 million in 2012) to offset the current shortfall in income from registration fees and will continue to do so on a reducing basis for the next 3 years.<\/p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fee, the HSCPC has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for controlling registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures: Where an existing practitioner with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, pays the registration fee of &euro;295 and is granted registration during the transitional period, also known as grandparenting, the application fee will cover them for the remainder of the grandparenting period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of grandparenting.  This concession will only apply to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act; the Council has requested the HSE to put in place arrangements for the deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary thereby spreading the cost throughout the year; Finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost effective operating system.  This will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700074#WRZ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":2071,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700074#WRZ02850"},{"type":"question","counter":2072,"qnumday":624,"qnumall":"[52222\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700074#WRZ02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the number of midwives working in Irish maternity hospitals in tabular form.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2073,"qnumday":625,"qnumall":"[52223\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700074#WRZ03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will confirm the correct number of midwives per mother working in maternity wards should be.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2074,"qnumday":626,"qnumall":"[52224\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700074#WRZ03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the number of midwives per mother in each of the maternity hospitals in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2075,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 624 to 626, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  There is no set ratio of midwives to mothers in maternity hospitals.

Within that statutory framework, all private health insurers are free to design their own health insurance schemes and to enter into agreements with health service providers.  As Minister for Health I do not have statutory powers to direct the VHI or any insurer as to what specific benefits are payable under any particular contract.  However, the Health Insurance Act 1994 (Minimum Benefit) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 83\/1996 as amended by S.I. 333\/2005) set out a minimum level of cover which must be provided by insurers.  In addition, the Health Insurance Act 1994 (Open Enrolment) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 81\/1996 as amended by S.I. 332\/2005) outline the waiting periods which insurers may require customers to serve in different circumstances, including in relation to pre-existing conditions.<\/p><p>  Cover for medical expenses under a customer's health insurance contract is a private contractual matter between the customer and the insurer.  If the customer is not satisfied with any decision made by an insurer relating to the benefits payable under their contract, they should first discuss it with the insurer concerned.  However, if the customer remains dissatisfied with the insurer's response, they may contact the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The Financial Services Ombudsman is a statutory officer who deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers. is service is provided free of charge to the complainant.  The decision of the Financial Services Ombudsman is binding on all parties unless the decision is appealed to the High Court.  Customers also have rights of access to the courts in disputes with insurers.<\/p><p>  Insurers provide a 14 day cooling off period where they will cancel a customer's contract and give a full premium refund.  However, I would advise all private health insurance customers to consider carefully the full range of plans and levels of cover available within the market before taking out a contract, so that they can be sure that their own needs are fully met.  It is important to note that once entered into, health insurance contracts are of one year duration.  Even if the customer is paying the premium in instalments over the twelve month contract term, this does not alter the contract in that respect.<\/p><p>  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) is the independent regulator of the private health insurance market in Ireland.

Such services are increasingly being delivered in or on the grounds of general hospitals.  Specialist Mental Health Services are, however, also provided in a variety of other settings including through day hospitals, day centres, respite houses, community and home based treatment teams.

The 2008 KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin Area report noted &#8216;<i>it is well recognised that for optimal clinical outcome, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services, or in the case of neonatology and fetal medicine tri-located with adult and paediatric services&#8217;<\/i>. The report noted that Dublin&#8217;s model of stand alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be co-located with adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new national paediatric hospital. Maternity and paediatric service co-location has advantages for infants with congenital malformations, for fetal medicine or complications which require neonatal surgery.  Maternity and adult service co-location has advantages for mothers in providing on-campus rapid and ready access to non-obstetric specialist expertise, and to specialist surgery and intensive care in the case of major obstetric emergency.<\/p><p><br \/>  In this context the proposal in 2008 was that the National Maternity Hospital be relocated to St Vincent's, the Coombe to Tallaght and the Rotunda to the Mater, and the maternity hospitals have been working with the relevant adult sites to progress this.<\/p><p><br \/>  There will be early discussions with the maternity hospitals regarding their maternity \/adult co-location plans in the context of the recent Government decision to build the new children&#8217;s hospital on the St James&#8217;s campus.  Notwithstanding this, I am committed to the intent of the report - that the Dublin maternity hospitals be located alongside adult acute services - while also bearing in mind the  need to plan for the provision of tri-located paediatric , adult and maternity services, as is the intention in relation to the new children&#8217;s hospital.    Management and delivery of health infrastructure programmes, including financing, is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. However, maternity service capital projects cannot be dealt with in isolation &#8211; they must be considered in the context of the HSE's multi-annual programme.  In prioritising capital projects within its overall capital allocation, the HSE must take into account existing capital commitments and costs to completion over the period.<\/p><p><br \/>  Work on the draft Capital Plan for the next multi-annual period, 2013-2017, is in progress and will be submitted to my Department in due course. My Department will then review the proposals and follow up with the HSE where further details may be required. The draft Capital Plan 2013-2017 will require my approval, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p><br \/>  My concern, with maternity services as with all health issues, is with patient benefit and patient outcomes. There is a real opportunity for the Dublin maternity service providers to further strengthen their relationship with their partner adult hospital at the earliest opportunity to realise clinical and financial benefits and efficiencies well in advance of physical co-location. We must use, within the acute system, our extremely limited health resources for the maximum possible benefit and to deliver safe, modern services.  Any decision on the future delivery of maternity services in Dublin, including the location of those services, will be made in this context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":2116,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":2117,"qnumday":640,"qnumall":"[52366\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Cork will receive a hip replacement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2118,"content":"<p>Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he\/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.<\/p><p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":2119,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA01050"},{"type":"question","counter":2120,"qnumday":641,"qnumall":"[52374\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the &euro;5 million allocated in the Health Service Executive's 2012 National Service Plan for mental health in primary care and access to psychotherapy services will be spent for this purpose in 2012; the date on which the 10 posts for mental health in primary care and access to psychotherapy services will be filled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2121,"qnumday":706,"qnumall":"[52952\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the promised investment of &euro;35 million annually in community mental health (details supplied)","asker":"1104","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2122,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 641 and 706 together.<\/p><p><br \/>  Funding from the &#8364;35 million special allocation for mental health will be used primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both Adult and Children&#8217;s mental health services.

The latest HSE Performance Report for September 2012 shows that the total number of patients waiting for a first time outpatient appointment, as of 18th October is 385,462, 71.1% of whom are waiting less than 12 months. <\/p><p>  Building on the work done by the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has now taken over the collection of outpatient waiting time data. Its methodology replicates the approach taken with the collection of inpatient and day case waiting times. The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format, revealing the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals, allows the SDU and the NTPF, in the first instance, to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.   Over the course of 2013-2015 the HSE together with the SDU and the HSE Clinical Programmes intends to radically reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. Key elements of this large programme of reform will include on-going validation of waiting lists, the systematic and standardised management of referrals from primary care, a reduction in unacceptably high &lsquo;do not attend&rsquo; rates and appropriate discharging from outpatient services when clinically appropriate to do so. <\/p><p>  A maximum waiting time target of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013, 26 weeks by 30 November 2014 and 13 weeks by Nov 2015 are the goals for the HSE and the SDU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2132,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA01950"},{"type":"question","counter":2133,"qnumday":645,"qnumall":"[52433\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the date on which a comprehensive set of supports will be in place for those affected by narcolepsy associated with the vaccine pandemrix; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1080","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2134,"qnumday":646,"qnumall":"[52434\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will detail his contact with the SOUND group dealing with sufferers of narcolepsy associated with pandemrix; and any commitment made to the group","asker":"1080","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2135,"qnumday":648,"qnumall":"[52439\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he will bring the package of supports for the narcolepsy sufferers arising from the H1N1 vaccine before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2136,"qnumday":667,"qnumall":"[52585\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding proposals for a package of supports for persons who developed narcolepsy as a result of vaccination with pandemrix; the reasons for the delay in bringing the proposals to D&aacute;il Eireann; when he expects to re-establish contact with members of Sufferers of Unique Narcolepsy Disorder; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1010","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2137,"qnumday":684,"qnumall":"[52786\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the date on which he proposes to put a paper to the Government on foot of the recommendations of the final report of the National Narcolepsy Study Steering Committee which concluded that the increased incidence of narcolepsy in children and adolescents here since 2009 came as a result of the a side affect of the Pandemrix vaccine administered for the H1N1 virus; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1053","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2138,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 645, 646, 648, 667 and 684 together.<\/p><p>  The association between Pandemic vaccination and an increased risk of narcolepsy in children\/adolescents is acknowledged in the report of the National Narcolepsy Study Steering Committee.

Levels of overweight and obesity have increased in the last 20 years, with a rise from 51% in 1990 to 61 % in 2011.  In men, the increase was 11% -from 59% to 70%.  In women, the increase was also 11% -from 41% to 52%.  In adults aged 65 and over, there has been a decrease in obesity, but an increase in overweight over the last 3 to 4 years and this increase in overweight can be seen particularly in men.  Almost 8 in every 10 adults 65 years and over are overweight or obese, compared to 6 in 10 adults 18-64 years. <\/p><p><br \/>  Recent data for overweight and obesity in the European Union (EU 27) compiled by the International Association for the Study of Obesity ranks Ireland as 1st in Europe for overweight and obesity in males (70%) and 4th for females (52%) <\/p><p><i>Children <\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  There has been a two-to-fourfold increase in overweight and obesity in children aged 8&#8211;12 years from 1990 to 2005.  Current figures show that 1 in 4 primary school children are overweight or obese and 1 in 5 teenagers are overweight or obese.  Girls are more likely to be overweight or obese.  The recent Growing Up in Ireland survey found that in children as young as 3 year of age, 1 in 4 are overweight or obese.During 2011, I established a Special Action Group on Obesity comprising key stakeholders and chaired by my own Department.  Its remit is to examine and progress a number of issues to address the complex and multi-factorial problem of obesity. It has long been recognised that alone no single initiative will reverse this growing trend, but a combination of measures should make a difference.  For this reason the Special Action Group is concentrating on a range of measures including actions such as: calorie posting in restaurants, the introduction of a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks, nutritional labelling, marketing of food and drink to children, the supply of healthy food products in vending machines, the detection and treatment of obesity, healthy eating guidelines and the promotion of physical activity.   When necessary the Group will liaise with other Departments and organisations in a cross-sectoral approach to help halt the rise in overweight and obesity  <b>.  <\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Procedures","counter":2148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA03150"},{"type":"question","counter":2149,"qnumday":652,"qnumall":"[52472\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of weight loss operations that have been carried out by the health service here in 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; the number of hospitals here providing these operations; the waiting list for such an operation; the number of persons currently waiting on an operation for weight loss; the amount of funding in place for such operations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2150,"content":"<p>I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":2151,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA03350"},{"type":"question","counter":2152,"qnumday":653,"qnumall":"[52473\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of patients accessing weight management services in hospitals here; the amount of funding that was provided to these services in 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; the number of persons on a waiting list to access these services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2153,"content":"<p>This Parliamentary Question has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA03500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":2154,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA03550"},{"type":"question","counter":2155,"qnumday":654,"qnumall":"[52491\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700075#WRAA03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on whether the number and standard of ambulance vehicles and levels of medical staff available throughout County Clare is adequate to support the cardiovascular services available at Limerick Regional Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"977","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2156,"content":"<p>The National Ambulance Service is responsible for the provision of national pre-hospital emergency care.

Day services for adults with disabilities provide a network of support for over 25,000 people who have a wide spectrum of need, ranging from those with severe and profound disabilities who are likely to need long-term specialist service provision to people with lower support needs and greater potential for community participation and inclusion. The demand for services for those who have left school or training continues to grow and this year almost 700 school-leavers and training graduates required new placements. Disability services have been required to cater for demographic pressures such as this from within their existing budgets in 2012, which have been reduced by 3.7% in the current year. The moratorium on staff recruitment has also given rise to challenges in service provision and in addition the physical capacity to provide further services may not be present in all agencies. <\/p><p>  The training centre in Dooradoyle provides a training programme for young adults over l8 years of age with special needs. Each trainee is funded for a maximum of 4 years and receives a training allowance of &euro;31.80. Individuals with a disability in receipt of this allowance are usually eligible for the Disability Allowance also.  In recent years, on completion of the 4 year programme many of the young adults had no employment option available to them. As a response to this lack of available employment, efforts were made to maintain the young adults within the training environment and continue to pay them the training allowance, although on completion of the training course the payment of the allowance should have ceased. No additional funding was provided for this initiative. The funded 4 year training programme continues to be provided at the centre but the numbers are now at a point where it is not possible to continue to offer a 5 day placement and pay an allowance to the young people who have completed their training due to funding constraints and lack of physical capacity at the training centre. <\/p><p>  The HSE is currently in discussions with the parents of these young adults on how best to meet their needs. Options being explored include reducing their attendance time from 5 days to 3 days per week and the discontinuance of the training allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700077#WRCC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2240,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700077#WRCC00550"},{"type":"question","counter":2241,"qnumday":686,"qnumall":"[52792\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700077#WRCC00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he will introduce a vaccination for Meningococcal Disease Type B; if he will outline the process for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2242,"content":"<p>NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.

The Scheme and its supporting regulatory regime were challenged in the courts by BUPA Ireland.  These challenges were rejected by the European Court of First Instance and by the High Court in Ireland. However, they ultimately succeeded when, in July 2008, the Supreme Court found that the manner in which the Risk Equalisation Scheme was implemented to be <i>ultra vires<\/i>.<\/p><p><br \/>  While the Supreme Court found the Scheme to be <i>ultra vires, <\/i>it is important to note that the Supreme Court decision did not strike down the principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover, nor indeed the principle of having a scheme of risk equalisation in place.<b><\/b>  Following the judgement, there was a need for a prompt response to maintain confidence in the market. It was therefore necessary to introduce measures in order to support community rating and ensure, as far as possible, that market segmentation did not become prevalent due to the introduction of plans aimed at younger, healthier lives. In response the Government introduced a temporary scheme of tax relief\/community rating levy in January 2009 which provides a very significant degree of support for the cost of health insurance claims by older people.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The Interim Scheme of Age-Related Tax Credits and Community Rating Levy was introduced initially for the three years from 2009 to 2011 in order to provide direct support to community rating. It achieves this by way of a mechanism which provides for a cost subsidy from the young to the old.  The Scheme was extended for a further year in 2012 under the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 and improved through the use of tax credits on the basis of 5-year age bands. This provides more precise levels of support for community rating than the 10-year bands which had been in place since 2009.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Interim Scheme provides that health insurers receive higher premiums in respect of insuring older people, but that older people (in six age bands ranging from 60-64 yrs to 85 yrs +) receive tax credits equal to the amount of the additional premium so that all people continue to pay the same amount for a given health insurance product. The scheme is designed to be Exchequer neutral and ensures that every customer has the benefit of a community rated health insurance premium. <\/p><p><br \/>  To support the principle of community rating, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place. This is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market. The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012, to provide for this permanent RES, was published on 18 October, 2012<b>. <\/b> The Second Stage for this Bill has now been completed and<b><\/b>  Committee Stage is scheduled for later today, 27th November. The main object of the Bill is to ensure that, in the interests of societal and intergenerational solidarity, the burden of costs of health services be shared by insured persons by providing for a cost subsidy between the healthy and the less healthy, including between the young and the old. The key measures in the Bill are<\/p><p>-  the provision of risk equalisation credits (payable from a new Risk Equalisation Fund (REF) administered by the Health Insurance Authority) in  respect of<\/p><p>-  the payment of private health insurance premiums by insured persons aged 50 years and over, based on age, gender and type of insurance cover.<\/p><p>-  each hospital stay involving an overnight stay in a hospital bed in private hospital accommodation<\/p><p>-  the payments from the REF to be funded by a stamp duty payable by open market insurers in respect of each insured life covered.  The stamp duty will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners and transferred to the REF. There will be four rates of stamp duty, depending on whether the policy provides for advanced cover or non advanced cover and whether the insured life is a child or an adult.<\/p><p><br \/>  The new RES will be operated prospectively by the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), with funds collected via a stamp duty by the Revenue Commissioners. In terms of financial arrangements, the main difference between this and the current Interim Scheme is that risk equalisation payments will be disbursed by the HIA rather than by the Revenue Commissioners. The rates will be set each year by an Act of the Oireachtas. The mechanism for assessing whether over-compensation has occurred will be the same as the mechanism which has operated successfully under the current Interim Scheme since its introduction in 2009.    The new RES will allow for a greater number of risk factors than the existing Interim Scheme, including a measure of health status. One criticism of the Interim Scheme, which has been in place since 2009 and which will finish on 31 December 2012, was that younger people taking out products that provided benefits below the standard level were potentially cross-subsidising standard level benefits taken out by older people. The new RES 2013 will provide for differentiated levels of stamp duty and health credits between higher level (advanced) cover and lower level (non-advanced) cover with a view to addressing this point.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The Government is fully satisfied of the requirement to provide for a permanent Risk Equalisation Scheme. I am confident that the introduction of a permanent Scheme, from 1 January next, along the lines proposed in the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012, will be one that is robust, fully operational and functioning soundly and will further strengthen and maintain stability in the private health insurance market, as we move to develop a new system of universal health insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700077#WRCC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2258,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700077#WRCC01750"},{"type":"question","counter":2259,"qnumday":692,"qnumall":"[52825\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700077#WRCC01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a young person (details supplied) in County Louth was refused their E112 application for assistance towards the cost of medical treatment outside the State on 13 November 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2260,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700077#WRCC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2262,"qnumday":693,"qnumall":"[52826\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700077#WRCC02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of E112 applications that have been received by the Health Service Executive in the current year; and the number of these applications that were refused.","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2263,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700077#WRCC02100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2265,"qnumday":694,"qnumall":"[52827\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700077#WRCC02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if patients making E112 applications are being refused due to a lack of funds to pay for treatment abroad.","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2266,"content":"<p>The HSE operates a Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS), for persons entitled to treatment in another EU\/EEA member state or Switzerland under EU Regulation 1408\/71, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulation 574\/72, and in accordance with Department of Health and Children Guidelines.
