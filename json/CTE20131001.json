This is an opportune time for such a discussion because a number of critical decisions will need to be made in the coming weeks and months in regard to the Irish economy and the value of jobs.  The Government will have to make decisions in the upcoming budget on the level of support to be provided to the various sectors.  Over the next several months critical decisions will be made on 50:50 national co-financing.  These decisions will be made in the context of a suckler herd that has already lost 100,000 cows and a large number of farmers who are considering whether to reduce their herds further.  We have to use whatever opportunities are available to us to prevent this from happening.<\/p><p>  This report quantifies the huge contribution that the cattle and sheep sectors make to the national, local and rural economies.  Its figures show that the livestock sector generates &euro;2.3 billion worth of output at the farm gate, which equates to total output of &euro;5.7 billion for the national economy.   The sectors support over 100,000 farmers and over 50,000 jobs in the wider economy.  The cattle and sheep sectors deliver a real return in every rural parish, generating economic activity and providing employment across the country.  Combined, the sectors have an unparalleled reach in terms of their contribution to the rural and wider economy.<\/p><p>  The report shows that cattle and sheep farms are low-income enterprises, in which direct payments represent on average over 50% of gross output and between 141% and 177% of family farm income on sheep and cattle farms respectively.  These direct payments in the cattle and sheep sectors are delivering excellent value for money, with a strong economic multiplier.  A key finding in this report is that each &euro;1 of direct support for cattle and sheep farmers underpins over &euro;4 of aggregate output in the economy.  Such findings have underpinned the IFA&rsquo;s sustained campaigns to secure a positive outcome to the CAP reform negotiations, secure national co-financing under Pillar 2, rural development, for the sectors and to secure support in budget 2014.  The message is clear; every euro spent is good value for money and a major stimulus to jobs, exports and the economy.  Achieving our Food Harvest 2020 targets could lead to an additional &euro;1.6 billion output and between 5,000 and 10,000 additional new jobs in the economy.\t<\/p><p>  It is critical that the Government shows support for the livestock sector in the upcoming budget.  A suckler payment is essential if we are maintain our 1.1 million national suckler cow herd and continue to deliver high quality beef to an industry which secures a premium product in key export markets and food service outlets across the UK and Europe.  Confirmation of a suckler payment in budget 2014 will form the basis for a strong payment for the suckler herd as part of the CAP implementation in the years ahead.  Similarly, continued support for our 32,000 sheep flock owners across the country is essential.  There must be roll-over of the sheep grassland payment in the forthcoming budget, which should be further strengthened as part of the CAP implementation in 2015.  Sheep farming is the second most common enterprise on Irish farms and is very important in terms of its economic and environmental contribution to rural areas, particularly in hill and mountainous regions.  The Government needs to make a strong commitment to 50:50 national co-financing to support vulnerable sectors in the context of the negotiations on the new CAP programme for 2014 to 2020.  The IFA is clear, and Professor Renwick's report will confirm, that any euro spent by the Government will come back as jobs and exports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013100100003#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Bryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380633000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me to address it.

If a sizeable number of people exit the suckler cow business, it will have dire consequences.  A welfare scheme is of enormous importance and I encourage the Government to go down that road.

We are definitely going to have a rise in the world population.  I was at a conference in Brussels yesterday where representatives from DG Agriculture and Rural Development and the Food and Veterinary Office were presenting.  They spoke about 2 billion extra people to be fed, with 400 million more people in China, 100 million in India and 140 million in Nigeria.  The UN has concerns about the capacity of these countries to feed these people.  They do not have the water or the agricultural land for it, so there is a huge concern about that.  There is a medium and long-term opportunity for Ireland to grow an industry that can feed these people.<\/p><p>  The UN reports made the point, which goes back to Deputy Deering's point, that the people of India would starve if food was sold at world prices.  Farmers get a substantially higher price for food than the world price in India because they cannot produce it if the input costs are higher and if they were to sell at the same price as a factory farm in the US or South America.  There is an acceptance that the price of food in India has to be higher, unless they want widespread poverty.  In Ireland, we have a small economy and are under huge economic pressure, but we have a massive asset with our agricultural land and our small population density, compared to much of western Europe, and we have the capacity to create jobs here.  However, as Deputy Deering pointed out, there is an innate problem with sucklers and that is why there was a suckler premium and a beef premium in the old CAP system.<\/p><p>  I want to go back to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's point about decoupling.  Farmers never mentally decoupled.  A man from Monaghan explained this to me at the ploughing championships.  He joined BTAP and learned to do his arithmetic, and he figured out that those sucklers are eating more than they generate.  He is also taking a 35% cut in his single farm payment over the next number of years.  He said that without that 35%, he was not going to keep the suckler cow.  He was on &euro;500 per hectare, and he is losing &euro;165.  That is the difference and he decided that the cow had to go.  Of course it will take more, but we must be realistic and in answer to Deputy Deering's question, &euro;30 would not go far.  Sometimes it has given people an element of confidence, and something just short of &euro;100 is essential.  If the Minister and the Cabinet do not provide, we will reach a tipping point.  I have been travelling to meetings for the last 20 years, and I know they are at the tipping point now.  People predicted in 2005 that with decoupling, we would lose 300,000 suckler cows, but I knew we would not lose any because every night I was out, everyone was pulling heifers.  Nobody is pulling heifers now.  They are all bringing the cow and the calf into the mart and they are worth more without the calf.  That is a frightening figure.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked a few very good questions.  If the market income plus some level of linkage plus the single farm payment leaves a lad with a family income, he will keep the cow.  If the three supports do not leave him with an income, the cow is gone.  Farmers have a different way of looking at things.  During the building boom, every genius told us to sweat our assets and sell, but most of us did not do that.  We could have got &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 per acre, but we still have the land because we are a little more pragmatic and we take a long-term view.  A farmer does not invest for tomorrow.  He invests for three years' time or ten years' time.  A man in Virginia explained to me the difference between a Cavan man and a Leitrim man.  A Leitrim man likes the cow and says \"She's a lovely cow\".  The Cavan man adds up one plus one, so he will hang her twice as quick.  The reality is that most farmers invest long term.  I do not build a shed and expect to get paid back next year, but that is what we do.  That is why we still own most of the land.  If we were like the builders and the developers, we would have sold all our land would probably have lost all our money on bank shares.  Instead, we own our land and are long-term investors.  We are careful.  We are prudent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013100100007#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Bryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1380635400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>With no disrespect to the president of the IFA, the comparison between selling land and increasing or decreasing numbers does not hold.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013100100007#K00300","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380635400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>It does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013100100007#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Bryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1380635400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>It does not hold because Professor Renwick's own figures show him the volatility in how the numbers go up and come down.

She is not going to pay us to look at the scenery.<\/p><p>  There are two groups culpable for the market price between the UK and Ireland, namely, retailers and the processors.  We can send cattle to England but we cannot get the same price for them.  An Irish animal sent to England and slaughtered there makes about &euro;250 less than one that was born and reared here.  However, the same rule applies in Ireland.  We have a substantial amount of UK-born animals being slaughtered here that make substantially less.  People got carried away and paid too much for calves two years ago, and they imported a lot of UK calves.  Those animals now make &euro;150 to &euro;200 less per animal here.  The foreign animals in any market always kill at a discount.  UK retailers today are running what I do not like to call a scam, so I will call one of the greatest things in the world.  They will buy English beef first, any day of the week.

We are stating that the single farm payment underpins production and that taking 15% from it would be a bad move.  As he stated, it can be done.  The UK Government is going to take 15% from Pillar 1 and transfer it to its own coffers.  The money involved will actually be used to pay a subsidy on state forestry.  The French Government is in the process of carrying out a large transfer from Pillar 2 to Pillar 1.  We have informed the Government that we would not be in a favour of any major transfer.  We might agree to a small amount being transferred to underpin a suckler welfare scheme but it should not be more than 3%.<\/p><p>  In the context of Deputy Deering's question, we want a focused scheme.  We do not believe people should be given money for doing nothing.  We believe in higher animal welfare - such as that provided under the suckler welfare scheme - data collection and breed improvement.<\/p><p>  The abolition of the milk quota will be of major benefit to the Irish economy.  The Food Harvest 2020 targets in respect of milk are modest and I am of the view that we will achieve more than 50% and that we could hit 70%.  If we consider the south Leinster and Munster regions, that is, north and south Tipperary, Cork and Waterford, a massive number of heifers are to be found on the farms there.  This can assist yield improvement.  As a result of the fact that we were constrained by the quota for 30 years, people did not push in this regard and we now have the lowest yields in Europe.  The average yield across European countries is more than 150% of ours.  Cows in this country will produce more than 5,000 kg.  They will produce 6,000 kg or 7,000 kg.  In my opinion we will substantially increase milk production and go well beyond the 50% projected.  However, I remain of the view that there will be no more than 2,000 entrants.  Banks will not loan money to farmers with 60 or 70 acres of land but they will loan it to those who have 250 or 300 acres and a large number of stock.  Conversion is not available to small or medium-sized farms as a result of a lack of availability of cash.  What will be the result of this?  Production will increase in north Kerry but I doubt if it will happen in south Kerry.  One cannot generalise but farmers in north and mid-Kilkenny will expand their operations but I do not believe those in the area in which I live will do so.  It will happen more on a regional basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013100100008#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Bryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1380636000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>There is a vote in the Seanad so three of the members will be obliged to leave.

I have to admit that this was before I arrived in Ireland so I can only outline my experience of what happened in the UK with these changes.  It was a combination of people moving out of the dairy industry and into suckler cow production.  There would have been an increase in numbers but there was also a marked increase in stocking density in both ewe and suckler cows during the period in question.  What we found in the UK was that when the relative profitability between sheep and cattle changes, farmers begin to switch between them.  This was noticeable after the MacSharry intervention whereby suckler cows seemed to be more profitable.  In Scotland, sheep numbers declined while those relating to suckler cows were maintained over the period.  There is interchangeability between the systems.  Clearly, that interchangeability came about in the context of milk quotas.  The abolition of those quotas may well increase the level of interchangeability between suckler cows and dairy.<\/p><p>  We did not come up with exact figures or a breakdown in respect of the proportion of the direct payments that emanated from the different potential payments to farms, that is, those which relate to production and those which do not.  A question arises as to the price at which this all becomes profitable in its own right.  The issue is that we must take into account the fact there is a huge variation in costs of production across the sector.  We have been talking about them so far as if they constitute a homogenous group.  Clearly, that is not the case, and for some it might well be enough but for others it might not.  There is a difference in production costs and systems.<\/p><p>  On Pillar 1 and Pillar 2, I am an economist.  Economists tend to evaluate things based on the question: \"What is the objective?\"  The real difficulty for us in analysing this is to establish the real objective in the context of direct payments.  Some people argue that they are an income support, while others argue they relate to production.  Then there is the greening element and whether it constitutes an environmental support or a payment to offset higher welfare sector standards in Europe compared with elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013100100008#L00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Renwick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380636600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Many of the points I intended to raise were made earlier and therefore I will not repeat them.  I thank the President of the IFA, Professor Renwick and Mr. Kevin Kilcline for coming before us today.  Professor Renwick's point was interesting in that the level of intensity of the farming practice also impacts on production costs.  In terms of suckler cows and sheep, cattle and sheep farmers may be engaged in intensive farming or they may have fragmented, poor holdings with low stocking densities and their production costs will be lower.  Professor Renwick is right in saying that our goal must be to try to maintain our cattle population.  We have to get the balance right.  Food Harvest 2020 has the ambitious target of increasing the dairy sector by 50%.  If that involves robbing Peter to pay Paul, whereby farmers will leave the beef industry and enter the dairy industry, there will be increases in the latter but we will lose out on the former.  It brings to mind the capacity in the country and the point to which we can increase overall production in all the sectors.  If we agreed that our goal is to maintain our cattle numbers in particular and improve our sheep numbers, the discussion moves on to the role that the direct payment schemes play.  Professor Renwick is right in saying that it would be good for this committee not to take for granted that a suckler cow payment will maintain or increase cattle numbers and that we need to focus on a wider view.<\/p><p>  I noted from a slide in Professor Renwick's presentation that from 1994 to 1995, when ewe numbers started to fall - there was a change in the ewe premium - the rural environment protection scheme was in place and I would have thought that sheep and cattle farmers were probably the largest recipients of REPS payments as against farmers engaged in tillage or the dairy sector.  Even though REPS payments were introduced for environmental purposes, the income derived from them was in the general wash of farm income, but it did not help farmers to maintain hill sheep numbers.  The report is useful for us in focusing on this area.  I would support it.  It is vital that we have a good suckler cow scheme into the future.  I hope that there will be provision for something like that in the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013100100009#M00300","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1380636600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>From my practical experience of dealing with farmers for a long time, it defies logic to say that a fixed payment that a farmer receives in any event has the same effect on what a farmer does as a payment directly coupled to production.  I would give the example of sheepfarmers who live in hill areas where they have no choice but to engage in sheepfarming.  When I moved to the west, initially a grant was given for a lamb and a further grant was given when the lamb went to the factory.  The focus of farmers was to produce as many lambs as possible and they were focused on lambing rates.  They also wanted to get lambs to the factory because they got a further grant, an extensification grant as it was called at the time.  When that was replaced with a ewe premium, farmers adapted fairly fast and decided that the lamb was not important, that it was only by-product and that the main money was is in ewes.  Even if a ewe lost a lamb, the big idea was to have as many ewes as possible on the hill and we know how spectacularly successful they were because they managed to over-graze every hill in the west.  With or without destocking, now that farmers realise that if they have a ewe to the hectare they will get their payment and unfortunately, given that the price of the final product is a abysmal there is not the drive to have high numbers of ewes because it does not pay farmers.<\/p><p>  If we consider the sucker cow or beef premium, it seems there is a huge difference in the way farmers do their calculations.  I do not agree with the president of the IFA that farmers are stupid in that they are happy to go along with losing money year after year and that the more cows they keep the more money they will lose.  The farmers with whom I deal are much more canny than that.  Is there any scientific evidence on this area or have any studies been done?  When the beef premium or suckler cow premium is paid on the basis of the number of stock, there is a great incentive to increase one's stock as long as the farm can carry them and that would involve an extra bag of feed in the winter to keep the extra stock.  If supplementary feed was less than the premium plus one's sales price, it made sense to keep up one's stock.  If a farmer is going to get a grant or nearly 100% of it in any event, although there is not any significant suckler cow scheme in place at the moment, it seems he would lose money on every extra cow he would keep.  There are not too many farmers who will swing at that game over the long term.  The question is how much of a directly linked subsidy there should be.  To ensure the system is profitable, one has to figure out, on average, how much of a subsidy should be linked directly to production to tip the balance in favour of production being profitable - an extra cow giving a farmer an extra bob whereby it would once again be profitable to farm more intensively.<\/p><p>  Having been involved in the industry and having ran a business at one stage, I know there a point is reached at which if one produces more one would make less money because overtime rates and so on would tip in.  In the case of farming if one loses on the basic stock and if farmers produce more, the stock will become much dearer because there will be less grass and they will have to be fed more meal.  It does not seem that anybody in their senses would go that route.  Farmers who engage in intensive farming are those who calculate, and develop their farms and keep the accounts.  It seems counterintuititive that they would purposely intensify their farms to lose more money.  Therefore, it is crucial that suckler cow farming - leaving the fixed income and the fixed costs aside - taking account of variable income versus variable costs, is profitable, otherwise there is no incentive for anybody with any wit or intelligence to increase their production.  That is reason I asked if sensitivity studies have been done.  I have asked Professor Renwick a question and I believe I should get an answer to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013100100009#M00400","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1380636600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I wish to make an observation.  This study highlights the value of the drystock sector to the Irish economy, particularly because of the nature of the sector where it is spread all over the country.  We rightly claim to have some of the best grazing land in the world and the ability to produce grass.  Between two thirds and three quarters of the land is involved in drystock production and between a quarter and a third of it is involved in dairy production.  Approximately 15,000 dairy farmers are in the main profitable while between 32,000 and 110,000, not including the 15,000 who in 1995 become involved in drystock farming, are in the main not profitable.  If there is to be a shift to dairy farming, the chances are it will be the most profitable of that cohort who will make the move.<\/p> <p>We are left with a sector that is very important to the economy but cannot make a profit.<\/p><p> This is all about being self-sustaining.  Regardless of the argument about whether farmers are happy not to be making money - I do not think they are - the next generation will certainly not be happy if they are not making money.  This industry needs to be profitable in its own right.  If it needs support, it needs support.  A focused scheme may well help it.  Such a scheme will not be of assistance if it does not contribute to increasing production inside the farm gate.  That must be the target and the objective in anything we do.  The study highlights the importance of the sector to the Irish economy.  We need to focus on how to make that sector profitable in its own right.  This is where we need to be careful.  If all subsidies end up allowing someone else in the food chain to take another swipe at the margin, it is self-defeating.  If we do not enable the farmer to increase his production and his efficiencies, while at the same time protecting or improving the margin he gets, we are destined to fail.  The committee and other groups along the food chain are doing some other work in that regard.  I do not mean any disrespect to Mr. Bryan when I say I would be interested in hearing the opinion of the economists on this aspect of the matter.

A number of associated issues arise on foot of the Deputy's question.  We have to understand the difference between economic returns and accounting terms.  It may well be that farmers are not taking account of the full cost of their resources - their own labour and their land, etc.  When we provide for such matters when calculating our farm income figures, we show that they are making a loss.  If farmers are thinking about cash income, they might not think they are making a loss.  As economists, we would argue for long-term sustainability.  It is important that the opportunity cost of their labour and their resources is factored in.<\/p><p>  The point about the profitability of this sector comes down to the distribution of costs.  It is difficult to cite a figure at which suckler cow farming becomes profitable because that figure would be different for virtually every business.  It would depend on circumstances like stocking levels, etc.  It is clear that a balance must be struck between encouraging those who want to expand and allowing them to do so, and dealing with those who are not in a position to expand.  The trouble is that if one is not careful to ensure the payment is not set too high, one might be in danger of fossilising the sector.  I do not think a fossilised sector would be particularly helpful because it would not allow those who are looking to improve in areas like genetics and welfare to go forward.  The need for balance in this regard has to be considered.<\/p><p>  Reference has been made to the relative profitability of the dry stock and dairy sectors.  We have a more profitable dairy sector.  Logic would support the argument that when quotas are removed, those who have the skills, the facilities and the capital access to turn to the dairy sector might well do so.  There is probably some truth in the suggestion that there is a strong correlation between those in the dairy sector and the more profitable and productive dry stock producers.  They are probably on the better land, etc.  Perhaps this change will exacerbate the issue.  A greater proportion of farmers would be involved.  The question of what to do also arises in this context.  When people say \"let them make milk\" - farmers should be allowed to transfer to the dairy sector because it is more profitable - it sounds like a cohesive argument in pure economic terms.  If that happens, however, this country will be at a greater risk of relying on a single commodity.  A diversified industry is needed.<\/p><p>  As our report highlights - this was reinforced at last week's Bord Bia sustainability conference - there is significant value in the desire that is associated with Irish beef as a brand.  It can add a great deal of value.  The problem is that we have something that is very valuable but is predicated on low or almost negative income.  It is difficult to know how to do our best to improve the economics of that without fossilising the industry.  I am sorry to say I do not have a direct answer today.  We need to think about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013100100010#N00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Renwick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380637200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I would like to make a general comment on the reference in Professor Renwick's report to sheep production numbers since the MacSharry reforms of 1992.

The Department carried out an analysis that has shown that the people with a single farm payment greater than the average, which is above &euro;250, have double the stocking rate of the people today.  We have the reference figure from 2000 to 2002 but if one superimposes the map on today, the people who have the higher payments still have double the average stocking rate.  In respect of the people who tended to have the stock - and it pertains to most people's parishes - very little changes and people tend to have the same sheep, get rid of a few sheep and get a few sucklers.  We made the point that Teagasc did not give great advice when it told all those men to get into sheep a few years' ago.  It was not good because they busted their way in and busted their way out again.  As Professor Renwick says, there is a link to the economy in respect of output.  If they have double the output, they are making a greater contribution to the economy.<\/p><p>  This is where I totally disagree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  REPS, the disadvantaged areas scheme, the suckler cow scheme and the single farm payment are all income.  It is the gross income - output of one's stock whether it is sheep, sucklers or dairy - that is the issue.  The farmer adds it all together.  He does not divide it up and put it into different pockets.  When REPS was closed own, it put huge pressure on people.  There have been cuts to the disadvantaged areas scheme and the suckler welfare scheme.  There are men killing cows.  Our Kerry chairman said at the last council that he knows of lads loading two cows into a box to bring them to the market not because they have decided they are not profitable but because they cannot pay their debts.  It is a simple matter of paying their debts which is why the combination of REPS, AOS or disadvantaged areas all add to farm income.  That must be borne in mind, which is why we are so strongly supportive of the need for 50-50 co-finance.  If the farmer can afford to feed his family, he will still keep the cows.  It might be a joke but it is the reality.  Half of the people I am looking at here have stock at home, including the Chairman.  They will not get rid of that stock unless they have to so from that perspective, it is a combination of income.  If a lad is already milking 60 or 70 cows, he has invested in the milking parlour over a period of years.  If he is milking 60 or 70 and wants to go to 100, he will have no bother getting the finance but to move from a green field with 30 or 40 sucklers, one is probably talking about &euro;100,000 for a milking parlour, so that it is a lot of money in any man's figures.<\/p><p>  There will be conversions but not every farmer will convert, be they in Kilkenny, Carlow or Leitrim.  Some people will not be able to get the money while age will be a factor with others.  For others, it is a matter of lifestyle.  Certainly, there will be an increase in production which is why we are saying it is so important to do everything we can to make the suckler herd and sheep flock more profitable because many farmers will continue and it is good for the economy.  We can carry out breed improvement and improve animal welfare where there can be an effect greater than what is put in.

In my first presentation in Ireland, when I said farmers should be looking to the market more, I was then set a series of homework by Justin McCarthy, the editor of the<i> Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i> on what consumers would have to pay for beef to justify a return if support payments were to be ignored.  I understand his inference.  We are talking about considerable price rises for consumers of beef.  There is a danger that one may price beef out of the market.  One is in a difficult situation.  One may get a higher price for the product but people may eat less of it.  If one is exporting the product to a wider range of people, however, more people will eat it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013100100012#P00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Renwick"},{"type":"speech","time":1380638400,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I see the point, but the margin along the food chain is the key.  If one looks at the output figures nationally, the output of beef is a little higher than dairy output and yet the primary producer is not garnering an income from the sale of the product in the marketplace.  The figures are available which support this.  That is not sustainable in the long-term.  This study is very important in terms of feeding information into the implementation group that will oversee the targets in Food Harvest 2020.  The report identifies and highlights the threat to the sector.  That is very important.  If I were to make a suggestion, it would be that this report needs to feed into the implementation bodies' strategy for the dry stock sector.  We will publish a report on the margins in the grocery sector.  We are limited in what we can do, but it is all part of the policy.  The support measures which are in the form of direct payments are aimed at improving efficiencies and productivity inside the farm gate and the ability to make a profit from the market  That is what must happen in the long-term.

I will base my input on research we published last May, published under the title Time To Go, and will also draw on research published by UCC last Friday.  Time To Go is a qualitative research study exploring the experience and impact of emigration on young emigrants who left the country in the past two years, bound for to Canada and the UK, and looks at their experience and the impact that experience has had on them as individuals.  For details of the background to the study, the research methodology, the findings and recommendations, I refer members to the report, which has been circulated in advance.<\/p><p>  Given the time limitations today and the remit of this committee, I will focus on the most salient and relevant aspects of the research - the economic policy implications of large-scale emigration of young people from Ireland.  I will frame the presentation in the context of the impact of emigration on the economy and the consequent skills losses, looking at two main issues, namely, the economic costs and the impact of demographic changes on the labour market arising from emigration.  <\/p><p>  To begin, I will give a brief overview of some of the data currently available on the numbers leaving.  It is estimated that in the past five years 177,000 young people in the age cohort 15-24 years have left Ireland, and a further 209,000 aged between 25 and 44 years have also left.  The number leaving continues to rise, with 89,000 having left the State up to April 2013.  The numbers emigrating are concentrated mainly in the youth population.  At the start of the recession the outward migration was mainly accounted for by workers from new EU member states.  However, since 2010 the number of Irish nationals emigrating has increased significantly and now accounts for more than half of those leaving.<\/p><p>  Our own research and quantitative data reveal that emigration affects a quarter of all families throughout the country and that half of 18 to 24 year-olds have considered emigration as an option.  Dr. Mary Gilmartin published material on immigration last year, explaining the reasons for the fact that we are receiving significant numbers immigrating into the country.  She attributed this to a shortage of workers with appropriate skills in some areas.  Another interesting finding to consider is that emigrants are now going much further.  We used to export people to the UK but now some 16% are going to Australia while Canada is receiving approximately 6% and the UK is taking about a quarter of the emigrating population.   <\/p><p>  The UCC EMIGRE study provides rich data on the profile of those leaving.  It is of particular relevance to the work of this committee in respect of the skills losses that arise from emigration.  A total of 62% of recent Irish emigrating graduates hold a tertiary degree of education.  Some 17% of Irish emigrants worked in construction or construction-related industry.  A figure of 47% had left full-time jobs while just under 40 of these emigrants left because they wanted to travel and experience new cultures.  These were often people with qualifications other countries coveted, such as valuable IT skills or were health professionals.  A significant proportion left to find another job or to attain job experience that was not available to them at home.  That combined figure was 46%.  Underemployment was a major driving factor with 13% of those working in part-time jobs before departure.  Some 23% of those leaving were unemployed before departure.  To reiterate, 76% left to find a job abroad who were unemployed before they left.  More than 70% were in their 20s, with a significant number in their 30s, mainly the early 30s. <\/p><p>  In Time To Go, we recommended that profiling such as that done in the study done by the EMIGRE study be continued on an ongoing basis.  The reason for this is to inform a strategy that will incentivise return migration in the future, a point I will return later in my presentation.  I refer to the economic costs, without ignoring the significant social costs.  Although emigration costs the State money in the long term it may help temporarily to alleviate the problem of unemployment.  When one considers the prevalence of large-scale emigration of highly qualified and highly skilled young people, however, it represents a significant brain drain.  Any future upturn in the economy requires a pool of well-educated young people to attract investment and to stimulate and sustain economic growth.  Many emigrants felt that Ireland was losing a vital part of its youth population at a crucial time when such vitality and innovation were required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100100003#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie-Claire McAleer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380631200,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I appreciate that and thank Ms McAleer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100100004#G00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1380631200,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I welcome the National Youth Council of Ireland delegation and thank it for its work.  This is the first study or snapshot we have ever had of a generation.  Does the delegation plan to keep it updated by reviewing the cohort surveyed to hear what they have to say, perhaps, this time next year?  Last weekend in my constituency, because of the all-Ireland final, many people returned from Australia.  I met one man who flew into Dublin from Australia on Saturday evening and left Dublin again on Sunday evening.  He had planned on staying around if my county won but he returned as we all did.  He was one of, perhaps, 200 who returned from Australia and America for the game.  Their attachment to home is still raw and passionate.  That is the cohort that has been surveyed but the older emigrants also come back.  I am enormously frustrated that this issue does not get the coverage it deserves.  I suspect if Dublin was being cleaned out in the same way as areas outside it are being cleaned out, one would read about it in every newspaper.  The issue is covered in a very stupid manner.  The survey shows how serious this is as problem and I hope it acts as a wake-up call to those who decide what is to be covered.<\/p><p>  A quarter of every family in the country is affected.  A brother of mine is away for the past 20 years.  Some 62% of those who have gone in the cohort surveyed have a third level education.  That is the plank on which we will rebuild the country.  They are gone.  Only 39% want to return.  I would be interested to have that percentage revisited as time goes by.  Will that percentage increase?  As people are away for longer, will they want come back?  My concern is that the percentage will decrease as people get settled.  One of the factors in this particular wave of emigration is that entire families are leaving with a loss to the school, the community and the team, whereas previously it was one member or, perhaps, the breadwinner.  Were those family units in the cohort surveyed or were they all non-family people in terms of their age profile?  <\/p><p>  We are going to get through this problem and the whole notion of a bringing them home to stay strategy is important.  What examples can be cited of good practice around the world where countries have gone after their emigrants to bring them home, following an economic recovery?  In regard to the cohort surveyed, Ms McAleer said 62% had a third level education.  What about the remainder?  Have they got a craft, a skill, or are they completely unskilled?

I wish to ask a number of questions, some of which follow on from the questions already mentioned.<\/p><p>  The UCC study was released at the weekend.  It shows that 60% of the emigrants have a third level qualification and 47% of them were in employment prior to leaving.  I am very cognisant that even though we are in the middle of a recession, there has been an increase in low wage casual employment and a casualisation of the labour market.  There has also been an increase in under-employment given that it now accounts for one third of part-time workers.  When the NYCI conducted its research did participants mention the kind of work that they did in Ireland before they left?  I do not want a message to leave the committee that these young emigrants just decided to go to Australia, for example, even though they had a good job.  We do not want to paint the wrong picture and return to emigration being thought of as a lifestyle choice.  I would like to hear the council's comments on the matter.<\/p><p>  I shall return to the third level qualification issue.  Ms McAleer mentioned the Dr. Mary Gilmartin study on the shortage of workers with appropriate skills and mismatched education with the labour market.  Has the education system been designed to give people the necessary skills?  What do we need from the education system?  What is the role of the youth guarantee in education?  <\/p><p>  A comment was made that the strategy to incentivise people to return, hinges on public employment services.  That is true for the youth guarantee and for the people who are here already that remain in terms of the live register.  What role does the NYCI see for the youth guarantee in terms of skills here and incentivising people to return?  Is there another strategy to incentivise people to return?<\/p><p>  The live register will show gains due to increased emigration and there will be a decreased expenditure on jobseeker's allowance but these are short-term gains.  Emigration costs and causes many long-term problems.

Many of them left because they had to and because they where unemployed.  They went through the same experiences that the committee is so familiar with.  Young jobseekers found it very demoralising having to sign on and were tired of the exhaustive unsuccessful search for jobs.  They felt that their opportunities were limited which was the determining factor that prompted their decision to leave.  Other people simply wanted to go.  The responses were mixed and there were positive and negative stories.  Both studies re-enforced the notion that emigration is complex, emigrants have many different experiences and not everyone must leave because they have to.  I would argue that the vast majority emigrate because Ireland does not offer them the same opportunities they can attain abroad.  The emigrants faced many challenges and one of them was that job searching was quite challenging.  They had a perception that they would walk into a job when that was not always the case.  Resources were also a problem for young emigrants.  <\/p><p>  The Senator had a question on the statistic that 47% of emigrants had left a job.  If one reads the entire research report then one will find that under-employment was mentioned quite a lot.  Some of the participants worked in full-time jobs but ones that were unrelated to their skills and qualifications.  They also said that they had no career prospects.  Some of them worked in jobs under threat of further wage cuts or the jobs were precarious in nature.  Therefore, they were uncertain that they could pay their mortgage.  There was also a threat that they might lose their jobs due to the recession.  There were a lot of factors at play.  <\/p><p>  We need a greater balance between academic, vocational and technical learning.  We need to focus on the soft skills of social and personal development which the youth work sector is so good at.  We also really need to focus on foreign languages because that is where future jobs lie.  ICT is another area.  We also need to ensure two things.  First, there must be rigorous evaluation of training programmes.  Second, if the programmes do not work then the money must be redirected towards programmes that do.  Some 17% of Irish emigrants worked in construction before they left and they probably left school early in order to join the industry.  They need to be supported and provided with new skills in order to enter the labour market.  Training needs to reflect the skills and demands of the labour market.

I am not saying that such a provision would stop all emigration.  It would stem the flow and young people would feel that they were making some progression.

When I spoke to the young people, they said it felt like they are gone and that no one was responding to the issue.  They mentioned the political system.  To some extent, the discourse has been set by the media and there is this focus on whether one leaves by choice or necessity.  While that is important, we really need to get passed that and put in place a policy response which takes on board the needs of the country, supports young people who are still here and tries to retain them and ensures we can get people back.  In this regard, we can be very proactive.<\/p><p>  If Government funded the ongoing collection of quantitative data on who is leaving the country, it would be extremely useful because we cannot have a policy response if we do not know where people are going and their profiles, ages and qualifications.  If jobs arise, how can we possibly keep in touch with them?  <\/p><p>  The other aspect of the research that was fascinating was that these people keep in touch with what is going on in Ireland on a daily basis.

If anyone has ideas or opinions, it would be very important to hear them.<\/p><p>  We have the figures, or at least estimates, for 2008 onwards but how do they compare to figures for the five years before 2008 so that we can get a real comparison as to how much things have really shifted since the recession?  It is really important to put everything into perspective because politicians, in particular, are afraid.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, got an awful beating on the radio one day over a comment he made but there will always be push and pull factors when it comes to emigration.  That is not to dismiss what is happening but it must be kept in the background too.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Calleary said, there is not a family which has not been touched by emigration.  My niece was home from Australia for five weeks over the summer.  It was great to see her and her new baby.  There will always be tough issues around people leaving.  However, we must get the facts on the push and pull factors and on what we are doing to ensure the push factors are limited as much as possible.  <\/p><p>  Much is being done currently, which must be acknowledged.  I mention the Pathways to Work strategy 2013, which was updated earlier this year, and the setting up of an implementation team to oversee the roll-out of the strategy, which contains 50 points and which specifically focuses on young people who are unemployed.  The youth guarantee is mentioned in it and how to roll that out so that we reduce the push factors in regard to people who are, to a certain extent, being coerced into leaving.  Social causes is included in that policy.  The particular team, which was set up and is being headed by Mr. Martin Murphy, has a really good blend of policy and industry experts who know how to create, and who have created, jobs in Ireland and who know about the lives of the people out of work.  It is important to put on the record the fact much is being done.  Of the 4,000 places on the Momentum initiative, a particular number are for the under 25s.  In the context of the conversation we are having today, it is important to at least put that on the record.  However, I do not want to come across as if I am pretending it is not happening but let us put it all into perspective and deal with the raw issues that are based completely on facts, including the pre-2008 figures which are really important because they will give us an indication of the extent of emigration, horrific as it is and how it is being exacerbated by the times in which we have lived for the past five years.  <\/p><p>  One of the best things we can do, which I will most definitely pursue, is to establish how the State and the Government can try to come up with some sort of incentive strategy and long-term plan to get people back.  That is a really interesting point and I was delighted Ms McAleer mentioned it.  I would like to hear her thoughts on it even if it is not today.

If there is anything to be learned it is that we must be more specific about the \"ask\" as opposed to saying, \"Come home and we will have happy days\" because that will not happen.  An article by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, which I think came out of UCC, referred to the fact that we are paying such high tax rates.  People are leaving because of the high tax rates.  I am from a rural constituency and when one talks about somebody earning &euro;100,000 they think it is a fortune, but that person is paying 56% or 58% tax on that and may be trying to buy a house in Dublin.  In comparison to the opportunities one has in other parts of the world, it is a tough sell.  We see that particularly in the case of young doctors.  We are putting them through seven years of education and even though many of them are paying for their education, it is still hugely subsidised.  That is not just a snapshot.  There are many issues that are interconnected so we have to look at this differently.<\/p><p>  I was interested in what Ms McAleer said about foreign languages.  That goes back to our education and we need to start talking about different issues in terms of those at a very young age in national school.  Ireland has changed significantly in the past 20 years in that we have far more foreign nationals in our country.  My own five year old talks about the Polish girl in her class.  When I asked her if she speaks Polish to her or if she is learning any Polish words, she said they do not do that at school.  There is an opportunity here and we should be far more open to that.  There is a significant call on teachers to look at things differently in terms of the way we deliver education.  That can be done in many different areas.<\/p><p>  The more I research the area of entrepreneurship, the more I am appalled because I used to think we were a great entrepreneurial country but we are actually shocking.<\/p><p>  On the number of people leaving rural Ireland, as somebody who lives in rural Ireland I see it every day.  It is frightening.  It is a major issue and I do not know how we can address it because the communities are being destroyed and there is a great business opportunity there.

It would be remiss of me not to say that in our research we encountered many who struggled to get jobs initially and had many teething problems.

I am conscious that no one is saying that a plan will be in place tomorrow, but we all believe that we can fix this country so we must put a plan in place.  The 39% of people who are interested in coming back is a little bit scary because we thought the figure would be higher.  Part of the problem is our pre-departure efforts - we are not supporting people enough.  The issue was looked at a year or to ago but people are almost afraid to discuss it.

As Deputy Collins said, we cannot simply invite everyone back and tell them that there are lots of jobs because we know that is not the reality.  The Chairman has touched on the fact that we need to get beyond the emotional argument in the media or the general public on whether emigration is a lifestyle choice or a necessity.  From our work with young people, the position in most cases is somewhere in between because there are push and pull factors.  We must recognise that young people are leaving, get beyond that and, as the Chairman said, be grown up about the matter.<\/p><p>  We still face a big challenge, but things can be done.  First is an issue that Ms McAleer has emphasised many times, but the committee might be wondering why.  We only have estimated figures - the data is not robust.  Even the figures that we have provided are CSO estimates.  The CSO has great data on a range of other subjects but there might be a resource issue in this area.  We feel strongly that, if this area is considered to be important, it should be resourced more, and that can be achieved in a short space of time.<\/p><p>  Second is the issue that Deputies Collins and Kyne mentioned.  We will not be asking every young person to return to Ireland today, but we need to keep them warm, for wont of a better phrase, engage them and tell them there is a website where they can access information.  As Ms McAleer said, many emigrants are keeping an eye on what is happening at home.  Even in our study we found that some young people said they were in touch with their parents more when they are away than when they are at home.  There are great social networks abroad, such as the GAA and other organisations, but if the State wants to keep people warm and make them feel they are still Irish citizens, leaving aside whether they should be allowed to vote, we might need to do something else to give them a sense that we would like them to come back at some stage and hopefully create the jobs so they can do so.  Those are two things that can be done in an environment in which it is tough to ask people to come back and tell them that there are loads of jobs because we know that is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100100008#L01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Doorley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380633600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>It makes economic sense and we need them back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100100008#L01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie-Claire McAleer"},{"type":"speech","time":1380633600,"counter":135,"content":"<p>To start with, we need to take a formal note of when people are leaving.

Today, there are 700 bodies with approved status managing 27,000 houses in Ireland.  These are large numbers and, accordingly, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, intends to put a regulatory framework in place that will include governance and management structures.  A consultation process is currently under way on the voluntary code and the committee would like to make an input.

I am chair of the Housing Finance Agency plc and I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Barry O'Leary, the chief executive officer of the agency.<\/p><p>  I have circulated a detailed statement to members outlining the function of the agency and our main areas of operation.  As I have addressed the committee on a couple of previous occasions, I do not plan to go into all our areas of operation in detail, rather I will focus on our work in financing housing associations.  To give some background about the agency, the Housing Finance Agency was set up in 1981.  Its function is to advance loan finance to local authorities and the voluntary housing sector, in other words, housing associations, to be used for any purposes authorised under the Housing Acts and to borrow and raise funds for this purpose.  In terms of functions under the Housing Acts, in the past we have funded some aspects of local authority social housing development.  Currently, we fund housing associations, social housing development and supports for low-income home purchasers, such as local authority mortgages, the shared ownership scheme and other schemes along those lines which had existed in the past.  We finance these schemes by loan finance.  Our mission is to source and structure the loan finance in a cost-effective manner to the requirements of our customers.<\/p><p>  We do not have a role in the formulation of housing policy.  That is the function of the Minister and the Government.  Rather our role is to provide appropriate funding for the housing schemes devised by the Minister and projects established by the Minister.<\/p><p>  The agency does not receive any Exchequer grant or subvention.  We do not lend directly to individuals or households.  In respect of local authorities, we are effectively a centralised borrower on their behalf.  We borrow money and loan it on to local authorities.  It is then disbursed by them to individual mortgage borrowers.  For our housing business, the Government guarantee on our borrowings enables us to raise funds at very competitive rates.  The total outstanding loan book of the Housing Finance Agency at 31 December was &euro;4.4 billion.<\/p><p>  My written statement to the committee outlines all our various functions.  I am happy to take any questions on those.  <\/p><p>  In my comments today I wish to outline to the committee our functions in relation to housing associations or approved housing bodies as they are called in this statement.  The Housing Finance Agency has only recently commenced lending to housing associations.  In the past we lent directly to local authorities and they passed on the money to housing associations via the capital loan and subsidy scheme.  Powers for direct lending to housing associations are enshrined in section 17 of the Housing Act 2002.  Our role in this regard in very important because the supply of housing finance for housing associations from commercial institutions, commercial lenders, is currently very low and also Government grant aid for this sector which was previously the main source of funding for the sector has been radically reduced since 2008.  Therefore, the Housing Finance Agency loans are currently the main form of loan finance for the sector.  However, direct lending to housing associations brings with it a different level of risk for the Housing Finance Agency compared to our traditional role of lending to State institutions such as local authorities.  We endeavour to minimise this risk by devoting considerable resources to comprehensively assessing the suitability of lending to housing associations and putting in place controls to protect the agency's assets, which by extension are the assets of the State.<\/p><p>  In order to be considered for loan finance from the Housing Finance Agency, housing associations must first apply for certified body status.  A set of criteria are used to determine suitability and they span three broad areas - past financial performances, current corporate governance and future developmental and financial plans.  To date, we have received 20 applications from housing associations for certified body status, that is, eligibility to borrow from the agency.  Of these six have been approved and ten rejected, one withdrawn and three are pending decision by the Housing Finance Agency's credit committee.  Where an application is rejected we advise the housing association in question what reforms are required to attain certified body status and we are committed to supporting them to make a successful reapplication in the future.  Several of the housing associations who failed to get certified body status from the agency in the past have been approved subsequently on reapplication.  <\/p><p>  However, we see no justification for amending our criteria for granting certified body status to facilitate a larger number of approvals.  In view of the fact that housing associations are currently unregulated by Government, we consider that the criteria we apply are the minimum necessary to ensure the loan to the Housing Finance Agency is repaid and the State's investment in the housing association sector is thereby protected.  Once housing associations gain certified body status from the Housing Finance Agency, they can apply to us for finance for individual housing developments.  Currently, we have approximately &euro;500 million available for lending to the sector.  To date, finance for individual housing developments to the value of &euro;36 million has been approved, of which &euro;13.12 million has been drawn down and &euro;22.6 million still remains to be issued.<\/p><p>  After housing associations gain certified body status, the subsequent loan approval rate is very high and 100% of loan applications to date have received an offer of loan finance from us.  Our arrangements for assessing loan finance are that we lend up to 80% of existing use-value social housing for a period to the length of the payment and availability of payment agreement paid to the housing association by the local authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100100003#D00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michelle Norris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380633600,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Norris and invite Mr. Brian O'Gorman, representing Cl&uacute;id Housing Association, to address the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100100004#E00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380633600,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I thank the Members of the Oireachtas joint committee for the invitation to address them today.<\/p><p>  Cl&uacute;id Housing Association began as St. Pancras Housing Ireland, was registered as a company in 1994 and our first scheme was completed and tenanted in December 1995, almost 18 years ago.  St. Pancras Housing became Cl&uacute;id in 1995 and Cl&uacute;id has grown rapidly throughout its life.  It now owns a stock of 3,700 dwellings and manages another 1,300 dwellings on behalf of other social housing providers.  <\/p><p>  I am sometimes asked what are the benefits of housing associations when local authorities have successfully provided social housing for many years.  I can give a number of answers to such an important question.  First, it is right to have a number of different providers of social housing because competition and choice serves to improve the quality of services provided to tenants.<\/p><p>  Second, housing associations are able to attract loan finance from the Housing Finance Agency as well as commercial lenders.  This, combined with a Government loan means that the social housing budget can deliver increased supply.  This is a particularly important point in current economic circumstances.<\/p><p>  Third, housing associations benefit from voluntary input which brings additional benefits to social housing provision.  In Cl&uacute;id's case this includes our board members, all of whom work without remuneration and bring a large range of skills and experiences.  <\/p><p>  Finally, being non-governmental bodies means that housing associations are in a unique position to develop innovative responses to housing needs in Ireland.  An example is Cl&uacute;id's pioneering work in progressing the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  After two years of very frustrating work the scheme is beginning to produce tangible results.  <\/p><p>  As Dr. Norris has noted, in many countries most social housing is provided by NGOs and monitored by the State rather than directed by the State.  The role of the local authority remains central to the provision of housing association social housing.  They decide where our housing is built, what form the building takes and all of our residents are approved by the local authority before occupation.  <\/p><p>  We have worked very closely with successive governments.  We are committed to establishing and maintaining effective relationships with staff in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Housing Agency.<\/p><p>  Cl&uacute;id aims to provide professional quality housing services to residents.  Customers, from whatever source, deserve the best service possible.  All of our property management staff are licensed to manage property through the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  Our properties are built or acquired to the highest standards available within budget.  Our quality services help to counter the stigma often associated with social housing.<\/p><p>  Cl&uacute;id is a strong supporter of the Irish Council for Social Housing which is the Federation of Housing Associations.  We contribute positively to the growth of the housing association movement.  We believe that the housing association model is an important component in meeting housing needs now and in the future.  <\/p><p>  We are very conscious of the State's large investment in the social housing that we have provided.  We take this responsibility seriously and are a strong advocate of greater regulation.  We work to high standards of governance.  In particular, we are committed to maintaining our property to a high standard in order to continue to use these dwellings for social housing far into the future.  So far this year we have spent &euro;2.1 million on maintaining our housing stock.  <\/p><p>  Cl&uacute;id is a strong supporter of regulation and views regulation as having three distinct components.  First, is the protection of residents, which is being accomplished through the extension of the Residential Tenancies Act to housing association tenancies.  The legislation is going through the Oireachtas at present.<\/p><p>  Second, is the governance of organisations, including the board.  That is the main objective of the Department's publication entitled Building for the Future.<\/p><p>   Third, is the monitoring of housing association performance.  At present this is organised amongst the housing associations through the Irish Council for Social Housing through the housing association performance management system, HAPM, in which quarterly returns are provided.  Progress has been made but we seek stronger regulation.  Above all we seek independent, verifiable regulation and governance, the absence of which acts as an obstacle to investors who wish to enter the market, as Dr. Norris has pointed out.  Without independence a regulatory process that involves financial and performance data lacks credibility.  <\/p><p>  I am accompanied by three colleagues from Cl&uacute;id.  Mr. Cathal Callan is director of finance.  He has spent many years working in the UK where he was exposed to the mixed funding regime that is being introduced here.  Ms Kath Cottier is the regional director in Dublin and is currently a member of the strategic policy committee of the Dublin City Council.  Mr. Simon Brooke is head of policy.

Regarding the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, Dr. Norris or Mr. O'Leary might outline the process for handling loans for individuals through the local authorities because how it works can be a bit of a mystery.  A person applies for a loan, having been refused by a financial institution, and the application goes to the local authority, but where does it go from there?  How is it processed?  What happens to it at the HFA level and back at local authority level?  I would like to know also about the lending guidelines for individuals because while I welcome that we are no longer throwing money around like confetti, the pendulum seems to have swung in the opposite direction in that getting money is like trying to get blood out of a stone.  I am not necessarily saying that about the witnesses' organisation because some people have been helped by it and have got loans through the local authorities recently, which certainly has made a difference to them, but as a State we do not seem to do anything by half.  We were throwing out to people multiples of what they were earning six, seven or eight years ago, and now the pendulum has swung in the opposite direction in that there is a stranglehold on money.<\/p><p>  In terms of funding, have any approaches been made to the European Investment Bank because it has shown a willingness to lend money, particularly for projects that can generate a stream of revenue, such as housing?  We have raised this issue with the EIB in the past and I wonder if the witnesses have had discussions with it on that.<\/p><p>  There is a group of people who are not entitled to apply for local housing.  If someone in the county in which I live has a gross income in excess of &euro;25,5000 - if they have children there is a small amount after that - they are not entitled to apply for a local authority house.  There are many people in the &euro;25,5000 to &euro;40,000 income bracket who are paying &euro;700 or &euro;800 a month in rent, one of whom I dealt with last Friday who, believe it or not, could get a loan to buy a perfectly good house for &euro;42,000 or &euro;48,000 the repayments on which would be only a fraction of what they are paying in rent.  However, they cannot get the loan despite the fact they are in full-time employment.  In the case of which I am aware, the two people are in full-time employment.  Has the Housing Finance Agency discussed that with local authorities or is there a plan to try to do anything for that group because the prospects for those people are such that they will remain renting from now until kingdom come?  The banks are even tighter than the witnesses' organisation when it comes to the money they give out.  There is a cohort of people in the &euro;25,000 to &euro;50,000 income bracket who are caught in that they cannot access money from banks or from the HFA.

To rent over a ten-year period will cost the State and the tenant a great deal of money.  Houses are cheap now.  We built thousands of houses during the recessions of the 1930s and 1950s.  A tenant will not have a permanent home.  Building or buying would provide that home.  The local authority would have a valuable asset to rent for years, after which it could sell the house to the tenant.  This is another pot of money for the State.<\/p><p>  In my local authority area, the amount spent on housing maintenance is &euro;700,000.  The rent accruing - this will increase substantially within the next month and on 1 January 2015 - is &euro;3.5 million, some five times the maintenance.

I welcome their agreement on the code of practice and the regulatory framework, allowing the private sector to play a wider role in the provision of housing.  How far down that road are we?

Once NAMA was put in place, we were promised a social dividend that would meet prevailing housing needs.  What leadership has been given and from what source?  As far as we can see, there has been no social dividend for the public at large.  Has the Department sought to bring the funding agency, housing associations and local authorities together to address this issue with NAMA?  I did not read the full context behind what a NAMA staff member stated at a committee meeting some weeks ago, namely, that NAMA was educating the Department and local authorities about its role and how a synergy could work to the benefit of the public.<\/p><p>  There has been no social dividend worth talking about for those who I represent.

It is difficult to know what the system's capacity is, as we do not know how much private funding can be leveraged.  However, are there indications of that capacity?<\/p><p>  I will go all over the place with my questions, so the witnesses might pick the ones that are appropriate to them.  I will not take too long.<\/p><p>  Obviously, only a fraction of the &euro;500 million in available lending has been drawn down.  One always questions why this is the case.  From where does the 20% on the other side come?  Is the general government deficit part of the problem?  Is there an impediment to providing the other 20%?<\/p><p>  A proportion of the loan books comprises borrowings on the basis of shared ownership.  One need not be a genius to figure out that there are problems with getting the agreement of the other parties.  Will it present a particular difficulty?

Some &euro;3 out of every &euro;10 in private rent is funded by the State.  Are the fictional costs that the Department claims exist counted?  I know no one who does not top up on rent assistance.  The difficulty lies in the fact that market rents are often much higher.  This causes problems for people, as they must make additional payments out of their social welfare payments, etc.<\/p><p>  There is a perception of cherry-picking.  I am aware of people who have been taken off the waiting list out of sequence.  The perception is that the most difficult or least well managed housing estates are local authority estates, in that they have a disproportionate number of people who, to use a certain language, have been rejected by a number of housing associations.  How can this situation be better managed?<\/p><p>  My final question is on the housing associations' social mix.

Deputy Cowen asked a question about the capacity for private sector investment in funding social housing via the housing association sector.  Obviously, it is very difficult to assess that capacity before we go out and seek it.  It is the case that in everywhere else in Europe, social housing is funded primarily by private sector borrowing.  Until the 1980s, social housing in Ireland was funded by local authorities borrowing, so borrowing is the norm and borrowing from the private sector is the norm elsewhere in Europe.  There is no doubt there is significant capacity to fund the sector.  The issue is about the capacity of the sector to make use of that.  As an aside, we have been approached by the European Investment Bank, so that offer of funding has been made to us.  As I mentioned in my opening comments, relatively little of the available funding we have even before we go to the European Investment Bank has been drawn by housing associations.<\/p><p>  The key issue is not necessarily the availability of funding if the structures are right.  It is the capacity of the housing association sector to avail of it.  The State has been funding the housing association sector since 1982 in a formal way with a formal grants scheme.  Since then, the sector's output has grown substantially.  Even when the State was providing full capital grant funding for the sector, the output reached a high of about 2,500 units per year, which is still significantly below the social housing needs at the moment based on the waiting list.  In respect of the agency, our issue is that we would be very keen for more housing associations to come to us to apply for approved body status, borrow from us and build dwellings.<\/p><p>  Certainly, to draw on finance from the private sector, international evidence indicates it is necessary to have a formal independent regulatory system and not a voluntary system as is being proposed now in order for housing associations to avail of that finance.  We secure loans on assets we loan against, so in theory they are security, but in practice no security can be realised because these houses are occupied by families in need of housing.  We cannot secure a loan in the way a commercial bank or anyone investing in social housing can.  Regulation is necessary to ensure, for example, that an alternative manager could be brought in the case of the worst scenario or housing associations could be given help if there were concerns about their performance to protect the rent roll and, therefore, protect the investors' investment.  That is why there is the need for private finance.  My view is that there is much potential there but the key problem is the capacity of the housing association sector to take advantage of that potential, apply for loan finance and develop the housing that needs to be developed, including taking existing units from NAMA and building new developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100100007#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michelle Norris"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380635400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>In respect of individuals applying to local authorities, I will not give Deputy Stanley a short answer but I will deny any responsibility in respect of the Housing Finance Agency.  As Dr. Norris outlined in her statement, we are basically a shared service for local authorities.  We borrow the money cheaply and lend it cheaply.  We only lend to local authorities.  We do not lend to individuals so I cannot go through the system of how individuals apply to local authorities or how that is underwritten because it is not a function we look after.<\/p><p>  The lending guidelines are given to the local authorities by the Department.  In terms of dealing with any changes in policy, we do not formulate policy.  We just fund the policies the Department has put together in schemes.  If the Department was to change a scheme and move it out from a threshold of &euro;25,000 to &euro;40,000, we would fund that, but it would be for the Department to change the policy and implement the scheme.  We would then fund it.<\/p><p>  As Dr. Norris alluded, we have some dealings with the European Investment Bank and already have some borrowings from it.  It has approached us to see if we would be interested in getting more funds.  Funding is not a particular difficulty for us at the moment in terms of having funds available.  The difficulty with the European Investment Bank is that it only likes to lend for new build situations.  It will not re-finance existing borrowings.  Our book at the moment is about &euro;4.4 billion and is declining at a rate of about &euro;100 million per year because there is very little housing activity.  The natural annuitisation of books allows our book to decline.  We are not making many new loans so we have no particular need to draw down from the European Investment Bank as a consequence.  It will only give us new money if we carry out new lending.  That pretty much addresses the areas about which Deputy Stanley was talking.<\/p><p>  In respect of Deputy Murphy's questions about the extent of the funding and the balance between 80% and 20%, there is a provision where approved housing bodies can approach the Department which offers a capital loan facility which will typically lend somewhere between 10% and 30% of a project to the approved housing body.  This is completely separate from us.  They effectively use that borrowing, which is on a long-term basis with the interest rolled up until the end of the project, for the equity to cover the other 20%.<\/p><p>  In terms of shared ownership and whether we feel there is any difficulty for the Housing Finance Agency, I would say \"No\" at this stage.  This is not to ignore any of the difficulties that exist with shared ownership.  It goes back to the relationship the Housing Finance Agency has.  It lends to local authorities and local authorities are in a position where they will always pay us back.  The very real problem exists at the local authority to individual borrower level.  My understanding is that a review group in the Department is looking at shared ownership and is hoping to bring some recommendations to the Minister before Christmas.  We are satisfied that the Housing Finance Agency's book is quite secure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100100007#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1380635400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Does anybody else want to respond to those issues?

If a tenant had a complaint against us, we were the judge and jury in the matter, so we see the PRTB as very welcome move.  It will also create much more equality between our tenants and private rental tenants, many of whom are social housing tenants because they are getting rent subsidy and are in housing need in the same way as our tenants.  We see the PRTB move as very positive.  We also see the orientation of the PRTB towards mediation and dispute resolution as something that fits very well with our ethos.  We have some concerns about the staff embargo.  The PRTB is addressing this by contracting out as many of its services as it can and making IT improvements.

First, the regulation of the approved housing bodies, AHBs, gives them the capacity to grow and meet future needs.  Second, the landlord-tenant relationship is regulated.  Mr. O'Gorman referred to the future role of the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, in that regard.  Deputy Stanley asked whether the PRTB had the capacity to do this.  It has approximately 265,000 tenancies.  We estimate that approximately 20,000 additional tenancies will initially fall under what will be known as the RTB.  While this will present an additional challenge for the PRTB, the Department is of the opinion that the PRTB can meet it by boxing clever, which is what the PRTB has been doing in recent years.  It has lost all of its contract staff and its core numbers have declined.  It has engaged in an extensive process of outsourcing and of focusing on its core business.  For example, its telephony is no longer handled in-house and has been contracted out.<\/p><p>  Tenancies within the AHB sector are typically much more stable than those in the private rented sector.  The AHB and the tenant want the relationship to work in the long term.  In the private sector, tenancies are typically of shorter duration.  Figures from the PRTB show an average of one and a quarter years.  It is a different cohort.<\/p><p>  As to regulation, governance and giving bodies the capacity to develop and access private finance, Ireland is trying to do in three to five years what other jurisdictions did in 20 years.  In England, for instance, funding to housing associations went from approximately 90% to 20% in 15 years.  In Ireland, we have gone from 100% to less than 30% in two or three years.  This is a dramatic change.  We are trying to put in place the building blocks that will give external potential lenders to the sector the confidence that individual organisations will not fail, that there will be a long-term plan to remedy any weakness and that the sector is a good long-term investment opportunity.  Given the way in which the Irish housing association system is structured, it is a sound investment opportunity.  Mortgage agreements go into decades.  This is the type of low-risk investment that private finance will find attractive.  Initially, we must put the system in place.<\/p><p>  We will have a voluntary system for the next two years because we do not want to leap into fully fledged statutory regulation without knowing exactly what we are getting into.  For this reason, the AHB sector has engaged in a process lasting one and a half years to define the key areas for regulation and the key metrics.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has given a commitment in this regard.  In her view, this needs to be a credible, autonomous and independent process.  Resourcing must be addressed.  In the short term, phasing in the voluntary code allows the Department and the sector to work hand in glove to define the best regulatory approach for the next few decades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100100008#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cian &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1380636000,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Callan, followed by Mr. Brooke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100100008#J00500","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380636000,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I will touch on two questions, one of which was on the future capacity of the sector and whether there was a ceiling and the other of which was on how far down the road we have come.

One of the key elements is the one under discussion, namely, regulation.  In any model that works within Europe, the key element to its growth and development has been regulation.  The Housing Finance Agency, HFA, has put a regulatory element in place for Cl&uacute;id and other AHBs.  We have hurdles to jump before we can access finance.  This gives the HFA security as to our ability to perform and meet the loan commitments that we are undertaking.  Without regulation, the commercial sector would not have the confidence to invest in us.<\/p><p>  We have come a significant distance from where we started.  However, we are still financially some way from where we have been asked to be, that is, being capable of meeting a significant amount of general needs housing.  What can help us achieve that is regulation, the release of charges on properties and the realisation that the sector is not all the same, in that it contains some entities that have the capacity to grow and develop and others that will remain as they are, namely, small housing associations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100100008#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cathal Callan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380636000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I wish to address the questions asked by Deputies Stanley and Catherine Murphy on tenant purchase and social mix, respectively.

I have detected in recent times that some of the approved housing bodies are to some degree accessing finance from commercial lenders, which is positive.  I would expect this to become a growing feature into the future, particularly when the new structures have been put in place as this will provide some certainty to commercial lenders.<\/p><p>  There is currently approximately &euro;500 million available to the Housing Finance Agency to lend to approved housing bodies, take up of which, according to the figures provided today, is very low.

I would welcome if when replying he would elaborate on whether this is related to skills, staff or governance issues in the approved housing bodies.<\/p><p>  My next question is to the representatives of Cl&uacute;id Housing Association and the Department.  Do they anticipate that when the statutory framework for regulation is introduced there will be an amalgamation of the voluntary housing associations and approved housing bodies?  I understand there are currently several hundred bodies-associations in the sector, some of which appear to me to be inactive in terms of their relationships with local authorities, the Department, accessing finance and housing related activities generally.

It is important to be upfront about the great diversity in the sector.  At the peak, there were 705 listed approved housing bodies but many of these were inactive.  One of the recommendations of the Grant Thornton report, referred to by Deputy Bannon, was that the Department should take a clinical view of who is active and who is not.  In the past year or so we have begun a process of de-listing bodies which may have been established for good reason but, for one reason or another, whose projects never got off the ground.  As a result, these approved housing bodies have gone nowhere or fallen apart and therefore we de-listed them.  At the moment we have boiled that list down from 705 to approximately 570.  We estimate that there are fewer than 500 active bodies in the country.  They range remarkably in size and capacity, from organisations that may only have five units under management to organisations such as the Cl&uacute;id Housing Association, which is before the committee today, and Respond, which have 5,000 units each.<\/p><p>  In designing the code we have formulated a system of regulation that is proportionate to the size of the organisation.  A small approved housing body with fewer than 50 units is placed in tier 1.  For these bodies regulation will be relatively light and built on the requirements imposed already under company law and so on.  Tier 2 is made up of mid-sized bodies.  Tier 3 is made up of larger organisations with more than 300 units which have significant development ability.  At the moment in Ireland we reckon there are only approximately ten or perhaps fewer bodies of that size.  It is a challenge for the overall sector to generate more bodies of that size and to develop the necessary scale to deliver.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to consolidating the sector.  The Department and the Minister are fully cognisant of the great work that has been done by the smaller approved housing bodies.  I do not believe we will ever be in a position where we will be telling people that they must merge because it would be utterly disrespectful to what they have done on a community and voluntary basis.  However, there is considerable benefit in those organisations at the very least collaborating.  There is a good model in County Limerick, where a dozen small approved housing bodies have come together and pooled the scarce resources they have to employ a full-time person to do their administration, organise contracts and so on.  Many organisations share the same theme, for example, those which work in a special care area, and there is definite potential in collaborating.  Over time who is to say that those collaborations could become alliances or mergers?  However, we are not prescriptive on that.<\/p><p>  Senator Keane asked about how the system can help the sector to grow in size.  There are several things we can do in this regard, in particular in terms of the regulation of tenancies.  There is a system of charging that the Private Residential Tenancies Board currently imposes on private landlords.  We have come up with a suite of tailored prices for the sector such that those who register within the first 12 months will get significant discounts.  We have made other adjustments to match the nature of tenancies in the sector.  We are working actively with the representative organisations, including the Irish Council for Social Housing, which has been referred to.  The council represents the majority of approved housing bodies.  There is also NABCO, which represents co-operative housing.  It is smaller in scale but no less important.  We are working with these organisations to see how they and the Department can help, particularly in the case of smaller approved housing bodies which may be daunted by the scale of the regulatory task.<\/p><p>  There is certainly a role for local authorities to help in this process.  Senator Keane rightly remarked that it would be a sin to lose all the expertise .  We have spoken to several directors of housing in local authorities.  They have said that they have in-house housing procurement and other skills which could usefully be offered to approved housing bodies to work collaboratively to meet local needs.  The Department is keen to see a blossoming of the relationship between local authorities and approved housing bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100100010#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cian &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1380637200,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I asked about the problems and disadvantages associated with voluntary housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100100010#L00400","speaker":"1062"},{"type":"speech","time":1380637200,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I will go to the rest of the panel first, Deputy Bannon.

In recent years, the agency has been funded by part of the EU-IMF emergency loan to the Government because we were shut out of the bond markets as well as the Sovereign.  The IMF-EU emergency loan facility enabled us to re-finance our existing borrowings at much lower rates.

We need to differentiate between the capacity of the sector to continue to manage existing houses and to develop more housing schemes and draw down loan finance.  As other contributors have remarked, the sector is very fragmented.  There are 500 organisations and a large proportion, approximately half of the stock, is owned by small properly voluntary organisations with no paid staff.  Most of them have had their dwellings funded by Government grants.  They provide a valuable service, in particular providing housing for elderly people etc.  This saves the State a great deal of money in other areas.  Do they have the capacity to negotiate complex loan agreements and carry out future development using that vehicle?  Probably not.  Perhaps they could have in some cases with additional support from organisations such as the Housing Finance Agency or if local authorities encouraged groups of them to come together to draw loan finance collectively.  There is an argument for the State to continue to fund them because the costs to the State are low and the savings to the State that they realise are high.  It is a valuable community service.<\/p><p>  The second issue relates to the capacity of the housing association sector to use finance from borrowing from ourselves or from commercial lenders.  I am more concerned about this issue.  Currently, we have &euro;500 million available for lending but relatively little has been drawn down.  The vast bulk of the finance we have lent has been drawn down by the Cl&uacute;id Housing Association, which is by far the most active developer in the sector.  We have actively tried to encourage associations to apply to us but only a relatively small number have been forthcoming.  This is something I am personally disappointed about.  We need to actively try to encourage associations to come forward to us with borrowing proposals and we would be interested to listen to them.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to upskilling associations to take advantage of our finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100100010#L00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michelle Norris","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380637800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>In response to the question on the commercial lending sector and the attractiveness of social housing to it at the moment, all our borrowings are with the HFA and the majority of our intended projects, which are at approval stage or have been approved, are with the HFA.  We have entered into negotiations with other commercial lenders and have had discussions.  I think we need to look beyond the commercial sector, to some extent, and at a bigger picture going forward.  If one looks at the commercial sector in the UK, which funded the UK housing sector, it has retracted from that sector significantly in the past number of years.  The attractiveness of 30 year financing to the banks is not there.  As this sector grows and as the key players in it look to access additional finance, we need to look beyond the HFA and to other slightly more imaginative ways of funding our business moving forward.<\/p><p>  I concur with Dr. Norris that Cl&uacute;id, as an entity, has from the start of this process actively backed regulation.  We see it as a cornerstone of where we want to be in ten to 15 years time.

That has given comfort to the HFA to lend us a significant amount.  We are looking at borrowings in total from the HFA and the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, of approximately &euro;40 million currently.

I would not like to repeat the experience.  I really do not think the future is about consolidation; it is about developing a small number of associations.  Consolidation, where it has occurred in other jurisdictions, has been driven by the state.  As we heard from the Department, it does not have an agenda of driving consolidation, so it will not happen.  Mergers and acquisitions in the private sector are fraught with danger and it is a minefield in fiercely autonomous not-for-profit organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100100011#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian O'Gorman"},{"type":"speech","time":1380637800,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  It is widely accepted that Cl&uacute;id represents the gold standard in the voluntary housing association sector.  Given the lack of regulation of the sector historically, it is probably a miracle we have not had one or two significant disasters.  In terms of the timescale for regulation, Mr. &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in mentioned a lead-in time of approximately two years.  Given that the lack of regulation has already proved to be a barrier to the voluntary housing association sector in accessing commercial finance and in accessing finance for the Housing Finance Agency, is that lead-in time too long?  Would it be preferable to see statutory regulation in a much shorter timescale?<\/p><p>  I refer to the UK model, its regulator and its powers, including the power to remove an entire board of directors and other quite wide-reaching powers.  Would the witnesses favour an Irish regulator having that level of power in regard to the voluntary housing association sector?<\/p><p>  I wish to ask a question about the Housing Finance Agency, and perhaps this is one all the witnesses could answer.  Is there capacity in the voluntary housing association sector, as it is currently constituted with a number of large providers and a large number of small providers, to deliver the social housing supply which is necessary given that we are seeing quite a squeeze already in urban Ireland in the private rented sector?  We are seeing pressure on social housing provision and we are potentially looking at a scenario where, after many years of lack of delivery on housing supply, we can see greater pressure on housing which will inevitably push poorer people down to the bottom of the pile.  Is there capacity in the voluntary housing association sector to fill that gap?  What can we do, outside improving regulation and access to finance, to ensure those barriers are removed and that the voluntary housing association sector delivers to the widest possible extent that it can?<\/p><p>  In regard to the Housing Finance Agency, I am confused about one thing and perhaps it can be clarified.  The presentation stated that the State's capacity to fund large-scale capital grants for social housing provision through the local authorities is likely to be limited for some time and that social housing provision through the local authorities forms part of the national debt.  The presentation went on to state that the HFA loans to the approved housing bodies also constitute part of the national debt.  Given that it may not be possible for the entire social housing provision to be delivered through the voluntary housing association sector - I am leaving out other measures, such as long-term leasing, and I am focusing entirely on social housing construction or acquisition - is there any reason local authorities should not be able to access loans through the HFA in the same way as the approved housing bodies under the same terms and conditions?<\/p> <p>In other words I mean gearing their stock at 80% and accessing a further 20% possibly directly through the Department or through the commercial sector.<\/p><p> I joined the meeting at the end of Mr. Callan's contribution.  He mentioned that there may be options outside commercial borrowing for the sector.  Is there any scope for real estate investment trusts, for example, which were announced in the last budget, but which at the moment are seen more as a means to fund commercial property enterprises?  Is there any reason a public-private partnership arrangement could not be reached between the voluntary housing association sector and the private sector through a REIT structure?  It has been said that Ireland is unusual in having social housing provision through the local authorities.  What are the options for having large-scale voluntary transfers of stock from the local authorities?  Mr. &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in said there was no real future for them as social housing providers.  Particularly with the land banks held by the local authorities is there any possibility for some transfer of stock out of the local authority sector to the voluntary housing association providers which would make them more commercially viable as housing associations?<\/p><p> Arrears on loans that local authorities have they have given out over the years have been mentioned.  I am aware that in the Dublin City Council area there are very significant arrears on local authority loans.  There has already been a discussion on shared-ownership loans.  I understand that because of the structures of those loans through the HFA, the local authorities can offer a MARP, mortgage arrears resolution process, but they cannot offer a MARS, mortgage arrears resolutions solutions process because they are not in a position to offer the same types of solutions to their borrowers as commercial banks.  Does the HFA have any function in that?  Mr. O'Leary said that he does not envisage the difficulties local authorities are experiencing having any impact on the HFA loan book.  However, without intervention from the Department I believe it would have an impact on the HFA loan book if the local authorities are in significant difficulties with arrears without having the armoury other lenders have in offering solutions to borrowers.<\/p><p> I wish to address the transfer of regulation for the voluntary housing association sector to the PRTB.  I wish to state for the record that I am chair of an approved housing body, Threshold.  I completely favour regulation which represents the best way forward for the sector.  What arrangements have been made for the sector to come under the remit of the PRTB, or RTB as it is to become?  I know the registration fee that will need to be paid was of great concern given the volume of stock within the AHB sector.  Would it be appropriate for some of that funding to be allocated towards additional staffing in order to facilitate the transfer of the voluntary housing association sector into the PRTB?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100100011#M00400","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380638400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Senator Hayden asked whether the lead-in time for regulation is too long.  She may have been outside the room when I said that Ireland is compressing into three to five years what has taken 15 to 20 years in other jurisdictions.  Statutory regulation should be in place by 2016.  At a minimum we will need that time to allow for the practical issues of legislative drafting and the preparation of the sector for the regulated future.  When we set out on this regulatory path we were very upfront with the sector in stating that we wanted to ensure it was reasonably well prepared for it.  Rather than waiting for a big bang in 2016, under the voluntary code we are working with, in particular, larger organisations in the sector to prepare an additional financial chapter to be appended to the code.  As I said, the code is very much an evolving document.  That would effectively result in a number of approved housing bodies signing up to more rigorous code - it will still be voluntary regulation.  If an approved housing body signs up to a code - even if it is voluntary - and then for whatever reason decides to walk away from that, it would not play well with it in terms of financial credibility.  We hope that over the duration of the voluntary code external lenders be able to point to a number of organisations which not alone have signed up to the voluntary code but have gone further and publicly committed themselves to standards of excellence and have committed themselves to being monitored or invigilated by the interim regulator.<\/p><p>  The Senator mentioned step-in powers that other jurisdictions' regulators have.  There seems to be unanimity between the Department, the Minister, the sector and lenders that we need credible step-in powers for a regulator otherwise it will not go anywhere.<\/p><p>  The Senator also asked whether local authorities should be able to borrow from the Housing Finance Agency and I am sure my HFA colleagues present will comment on this.  In mathematical terms there is no reason but at the moment keeping stuff off the general Government debt picture is critical.  In other jurisdictions there are precedents where local authorities can effectively form an organisation to borrow.  It may not be an answer at this time, but hopefully as the economy continues to recover, it might emerge as a possibility.<\/p><p>  The PRTB will become the RTB from next year.  The Minister is very aware that the PRTB has done manfully well to cope with a virtual doubling of its work with a halving of its staffing resources.  The PRTB has submitted a staffing application to the Department which we will obviously need to consider along with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform within the overall context of the employment constraints.  As a Department, we are very sympathetic to the PRTB case.  Sympathy does not fill jobs, but we recognise the PRTB has done a huge amount - to use that horrible phrase - to sweat its assets as far as it can and we are very supportive of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100100012#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cian &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380638400,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Senator Hayden asked about the type of regulation that is appropriate.

They are actively working on a mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, solution for their borrowers.  We are not unaware that if they were to run into financial difficulties, they could have cashflow issues in terms of paying us, but happily we have no arrears at the moment.  We have indicated to all local authorities that in the event of them having any cashflow issues where the receipts coming in from their borrowers are less than what they would require to borrow from us, we would look at some of our own cashflow mirroring and we would adjust the term and we would give them payment holidays or whatever.  No local authority has approached us so far about this, but it is in their armoury if they need it to address the process.  The MARP process is particularly important as it will be developed in the next two or three years.

The simple answer is that I would like to have a regulator now.  We have been talking about regulation for a number of years now.  We are tasked with funds to supply general needs housing.  A regulator in place will make that cheaper in respect of interest rates and makes the access to it easier.  I said earlier that I thought commercial lending for this sector would be limited in the medium term.  The world may possibly change in the long term and it may revolve back, but in the short term, commercial lending will be limited in the sector.  Why do we need a regulator if we have access to the HFA?  I think there is a need for the sector to move on from the HFA.  The HFA has a key part to play in this initial stage and in the future, as there is a long-term relationship in respect of 30 year loan facilities.  The key advantage of a regulator is that it builds confidence in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100100013#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cathal Callan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380639600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their engagement with the committee.

I wish to raise again a concern which I raised on Second Stage in relation to the network.  The Minister has received a detailed submission from the Western Development Commission regarding the use of part of the funds to be generated from the sale of this particular entity, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, for the extension of the third phase of the development of the network to towns in the west and north west that have not to date had access to gas.  The Western Development Commission estimates that this would save businesses in the north west region approximately &euro;16.4 million per annum.  When Gaslink completed its assessment, in terms of the cost benefit analysis of bringing gas to the regions, it found the cost of bringing gas to a town like Carrrick-on-Shannon would be a negative of &euro;1.12 million.  If gas was available in Carrick-on-Shannon businesses there would save &euro;7 million per annum.  However, because of a shortfall of &euro;1.12 million this will not now happen.  The same argument could be made in relation to Longford, Sligo, Ballaghaderreen, Boyle, Roscommon and so on.  The reality is that there is no money available to meet this deficit.<\/p><p>  Gaslink carried out its assessment based on the criteria set out by the energy regulator.  This legislation facilitates the sale of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, the money generated from which is to be used for job initiatives.  Surely there is no better job initiative than the laying of a valuable infrastructure network that would sustain not only existing jobs but create additional jobs in a part of the country in which there has been a huge haemorrhage in terms of emigration and which is at a competitive disadvantage in comparison with other parts of the country.  I will give an example.  An employer with whom I spoke during the past fortnight, who currently employs 60 people, told me that he if had access to natural gas he could employ an additional ten people tomorrow.  This is the difference access to natural gas would make to him.  I do not believe that the west should be the only region in the country with no access to gas.  <\/p><p>  The reality is that if provision is not made in this legislation for between 7% and 10% of the funds generated from the sale to be used for expansion of the gas network this will not happen.  If this cannot be done then the criteria laid down by the energy regulator in relation to the assessment of the cost benefit analysis in bringing gas to these regions should at least be reviewed.  That towns like Carrick-on-Shannon are losing out in terms of gas provision owing to the unavailability of &euro;1.12 million is unacceptable.  There is a need for consideration of socioeconomic dividends and balanced regional development in this regard, none of which are taken into account in terms of the manner in which CER has laid down the criteria on which Gaslink is required to make its assessment.  The cost could be paid off over a longer term by way of user charges following a variation of the criteria laid down by CER or, as suggested by the Western Development Commission in a document it published some years ago, a small proportion of the money generated from the sale of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann could be ringfenced for expansion of the network not only to towns in the north west but to other towns throughout the country where there is a small margin in terms of it being financially viable to bring gas to them.  This would be of huge benefit to businesses and industries in such towns and to the people currently employed therein.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62013100100004#C01600","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1380641400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>There is no doubt the north west, in particular, is somewhat disadvantaged in this regard.  I am familiar with the report from the Western Development Commission to which Deputy Naughten refers.  Two difficulties arise in this respect.  First, we cannot create a hypothecated fund or earmark funds for a particular purpose.  The legislation derives from the history and background of the decision to dispose of State assets, starting from a point where it was the adamant view of the troika that all proceeds realised from such disposals should go towards writing down debt.  Over a period of more than six months, the troika's position moved to one where it stipulated that 50% of such proceeds could be used for productive job investment, with the remaining 50% to be used ultimately to pay down debt.  Theoretically, therefore, there is no reason that funding for Deputy Naughten's purpose could not come under the first category, other than that extensions of the gas network are based on an economic assessment carried out by Gaslink at the behest of and overseen by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  Gas extensions proceed only where they pass this economic test.  For example, a recent decision to extend the gas network to Nenagh was on a knife edge but was eventually brought across the line by two or three employers in the town.  Employment prospects at one large creamery in particular were considered sufficient to warrant the extension of the networks to the town.  However, the proposition that one would extend the gas networks to consumers who could not bear it for economic reasons would not be approved by the regulator.<\/p><p>  Deputy Naughten's secondary request was that I examine the criteria the regulator brings to bear.  This is complex terrain and while I am not opposed to carrying out such a review, as circumstances stand, I am not in a position, nor would I be a position even with the approval of the Minister for Finance, to earmark part of the probable proceeds for a stated purpose other than the generic one of creating employment.  Even if I could so designate the proceeds, it would not change the criteria which are applied by the regulator in deciding where there is an economic proposition to extend the network.<\/p><p>  While I accept that this issue has created problems in the north west, the manner in which that issue can be addressed is for another day's discussion.  The issue arose in a different context in terms of natural gas coming ashore in north County Mayo.  Deputy Naughten will be familiar with the proposals made by Mr. Peter Cassells in that regard.  I have always believed that those who have taken a particular stance in the area in question have undersold the benefits that arose from the discussions Mr. Cassells held, which will make a significant contribution, at least in County Mayo.  I accept, however, that as one moves up through County Roscommon and into County Sligo and further, a significant issue arises.  However, under the economic criteria currently applied by the regulator, I am not enabled to do as the Deputy proposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62013100100005#D00100","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1380641400,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response, which I had headed off to some extent when I pointed out that we need to revisit the criteria that are laid down by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  To refer again to the Chairman's home town of Ballaghaderreen, it has a massive creamery with the same ownership structure as the creamery in Nenagh and also has significant energy demands.  Not only are we jeopardising jobs in Ballaghaderreen and similar towns, but we are also limiting the capacity of the region to capitalise on the potential growth that will emerge from the abolition of milk quotas in 2015.  As a result, part of the country will not be able to secure the same level of economic growth as the south because it does not have access to natural gas, which is vital for processing liquid milk.  It is frustrating to hear everyone argue the west is not nearly as efficient at producing milk as the south.  Some people dispute that contention but the reality is that the west is far more efficient at producing milk than any other part of Europe outside of Ireland.  We cannot avail of the potential for growth arising from abolition of quota 2015 because we do not have access to natural gas.  The west would probably meet the regulator's criteria if one were to take into account this potential growth but we must first build the factories and demonstrate increased demand if the gas network is to be extended.  Investors will not make investments on the basis of a hope that gas will be provided at some point in the future.  We are at a disadvantage in this regard.<\/p><p>  The Minister indicated he is not prepared to ring-fence part of the funding and set out reasons he is unable to do so.  At a minimum, the criteria for the cost-benefit analysis by the Commission for Energy Regulation need to be reassessed to take into consideration the potential for economic growth and the need for greater balance in economic development.  Such a regional balances is currently absent and towns such as Ballaghaderreen, Boyle and Roscommon are suffering as a result. <\/p><p>  To try to progress the debate, I ask the Minister, on Report Stage, to make provision in the Bill requiring that once the disposal of the asset is complete, a report will be furnished to the House setting out how the proceeds will be distributed and what job initiatives will be allocated moneys.  Every contributor on Second Stage noted that the purpose of the legislation is to create a vehicle for generating moneys for job creation purposes.  The Minister has indicated his hands are tied in this legislation and he cannot set out priorities for job creation.  The Bill is either a vehicle for job creation or it is not.  If it is such a vehicle, the least that should be done is to provide in the legislation that a report will be furnished to the Oireachtas - depending on the outcome of the forthcoming referendum, it may be the D&aacute;il only - setting out what criteria will be used in respect of the allocation of the funds that will be generated from the sale.  This would allow us to identify what are the job creation strategies and how they will impact on the country, in particular with regard to balanced regional development.<\/p><p>  I regret that this is our last opportunity to bring gas to parts of the country that do not have access to the gas network.  The economic challenges facing our region will increase in the years ahead as industry declines and it haemorrhages jobs because local companies are not able to compete with other parts of the country.  It will be a self-fulfilling prophesy as a result of the lack of provision of gas to the north west.  We had to wait for a gas discovery off the coast before a gas network was established to export it.  We should not have had to wait for this network. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62013100100005#D00200","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1380641400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>On the issue of balanced regional development, I am concerned that some of the previous suggestions will be taken on board as to do so would tie the Government's hands in respect of where the money could and could not be spent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62013100100005#D00300","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380642000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Deputy Naughten's argument about balanced regional development is well made, but Deputy Naughten knows as well as I do that we are discussing an independent function of the regulator.

Deputy O'Donovan can see the towns in the report.  They are situated throughout the midlands, the west, the east coast and the south.  None of these towns in any part of the country will have the opportunity to avail of gas.  The study has already been completed by Gaslink.  It has done the cost benefit analysis.  The issue is in respect of how to make up the shortfall or how to nuance the criteria to ensure that they fall in under the assessment of the cost benefit analysis.

In November 2010, the memorandum of understanding agreed between the then Government and the EU-IMF-ECB in the bailout programme committed \"to setting appropriate targets for the possible privatisation of state-owned assets\".  Following lengthy and tough negotiations with the troika, the current Government has been able to agree a position whereby the quantum of State asset disposals is less than that initially demanded by the troika.  The use of the proceeds will assist economic recovery - as we have been debating - and key strategic assets, such as the gas transmission and distribution systems, will be retained in State ownership.  To deliver on our troika commitments and, more important, to fund our programme for jobs and economic recovery, we must proceed with the sale of the company's energy business.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment that seeks to delete section 29, the provision that empowers BGE to sell the energy business, subject to ministerial consent.<\/p><p>  Nevertheless, I do not disagree with the sentiment advanced by Deputy Moynihan when he mentions trying to ensure there is no unfair distribution of debt.

I do not know the particular commercial sensitivities or the terms of the deal and all of that, but what I do know is that the fundamental point of Deputy Moynihan's amendment, namely, that I must be accountable for what happens and must report back to this committee within 12 months, is something I am willing to take on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62013100100008#G01500","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1380643200,"counter":294,"content":"<p>On that point, although the Minister states it is not necessary to enshrine this commitment in primary legislation, would it not be, for want of a better phrase, a belt and braces job to ensure the commitment is therein enshrined?

If the Minister was sitting on this side that would be a fair one for him to swallow.  I have no doubt about his bona fides on this issue and I have no doubt that if he is Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources this time next year, after the sale, he will appear before the committee and elaborate as stated.  We have been told there will be a reshuffle during the summer and the reality is that he may not be the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources this time next year.  He may have a higher portfolio at that stage.  There is no guarantee that whoever is in his position this time next year will appear before the committee.  There is precedent for this but I am not sure if it was in this portfolio.  The late S&eacute;amus Brennan gave a commitment which was put into primary legislation that the disposal of Aer Lingus would not be approved prior to the authorisation of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That condition was inserted in the legislation because there were concerns regarding landing slots at Heathrow Airport.  The Minister can check the file but so far as I can recall the Attorney General's office spent some time trying to ascertain if there was any possible way of getting around that condition without having to come  back to the Oireachtas to receive the authorisation.<\/p><p>  The condition Deputy Moynihan seeks to have inserted needs to be elaborated on but we are all agreed on the principle that the Minister of the day should report back on the sale of the assets and how the money is going to be utilised.  The question is whether it should be enshrined in primary legislation.  The reality is that once the Minister of the day goes out this door and it closes behind him, all bets are off.  I do not doubt his bona fides but the reality is that we have had other Ministers who may not have been as sincere as the Minister.  There is no guarantee that in 12 months time the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, will be the Minister in charge of this brief.  If there are questions over the disposal of the assets the Minister of the day may not be as anxious to appear before the committee.  That is why it is fundamentally important that it is written into the primary legislation, to ensure there is an onus and responsibility on the Minister of the day to come back and report and justify how and why he or she went about the sale in order that we do not have a continual series of parliamentary questions, leaks to the media, and a series of issues being raised on Leaders' Questions and the Order of Business before the Government of the day concedes to a parliamentary inquiry.  We would then be back to square one with the rubbish we have seen in the past in respect of some of the parliamentary inquiries.  Let us be up-front and insert it in the legislation.  Let us make provision for the Minister of the day to come back and elaborate on the issues we all agree need to be elaborated on and which are part of the Bill.  The question is whether it should be enshrined in legislation.  I urge the Minister to look at the issue and come back on Report Stage with an amendment that articulates exactly what he has said here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62013100100009#H00200","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1380643800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>There is precedent in other Acts but not exactly in respect of the sale of State assets.
