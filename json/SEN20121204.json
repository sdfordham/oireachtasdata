One cannot be criticised for wondering about the kettle calling the pot black when one considers the particular lack of success with the implementation of the SUSI plan, which was going to be the solution to all of the problems of many students throughout this country.  All of us in our clinics, throughout the entirety of the Twenty-six Counties, have come across people who are having to leave college because their funding has not arrived.  It seems unusual that the Minister would seek to deflect blame from his own Department onto the Minister for Health.<\/p><p>Having said that, there is clearly serious division in government when the Minister for Health does not have the confidence of his Cabinet colleagues.  Indeed, it is hardly a coincidence that the Minister, Deputy Quinn, did not contribute to the debate on the motion of confidence which took place in the D\u00e1il on the issue.  While I am conscious that, with the budget tomorrow, we cannot facilitate all debates as quickly as one might like, we should ask the Minister for Health to come to the House by Thursday at the latest.  In the other House today, a Supplementary Estimate of \u20ac370 million is to be adopted without debate, which shows the absolute incompetence of the Minister in question.  This is far from being a surprise.  In February of last year people on this side in both the D\u00e1il and the Seanad highlighted the fact that there was not enough money and that the budget was wrong and dishonest.  Indeed, this was borne out by Mr. Cathal Magee, who, as we well know, was then shafted from his position as head of the HSE for speaking the truth.<\/p><p>What we have, in effect, is a lame duck Minister who does not have the confidence of his Cabinet colleagues.  As a result of so much kite-flying, plus genuine cuts to home help, acute hospitals and other services throughout the last year, we have a nation terrified that the person who holds the financial reins in the context of the health reforms that are required does not have the confidence of his Cabinet colleagues and, as a result, will not be competent in putting the necessary health budget across the line tomorrow.  In that regard, I ask the Leader as a matter of the utmost urgency to arrange that both Ministers make themselves available to Seanad \u00c9ireann for some genuine questioning, rather than the kite-flying and rhetoric which is all we have seen in the last months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400004#C00300","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1354631700,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Senator MacSharry has sunk to a new low in looking for Ministers to be brought into this House to answer queries about quotes attributed to them in the newspapers in some sort of manufactured rift that certain journalists are seeking to whip up between Cabinet members.

We have not moved in the way that other European countries have to have a tax on property.  As pointed out by economists, this is a wealth tax.  It is important that those who own houses worth more pay more.  I note that the Commission on Taxation has pointed out that there are 3,000 houses in Ireland worth more than &#8364;1 million and that &#8364;500 million would be generated in a full year from a new property tax.  It is important this change be made and that it be made on an equitable basis.  It is important that we debate the difference between property values in Dublin and the rest of the country in this regard because property prices in Dublin rose higher for a longer period and have remained higher.

We are now heading into the Christmas period where there is a great deal of emphasis on the sale of toys.  It is important that the relevant Department should run an advertising campaign on safety issues.  In Europe more than 180,000 children are admitted to emergency departments in hospitals during the Christmas period because of accidents arising from defective toys or toys not being used correctly.  There is an EU toys directive and also a system, Rapex, whereby if a defective item is identified in one country that country must notify the other 26 about the defective item.  It is important to focus on safety at this time, especially with young children.  The relevant Department, which I believe is under the remit of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, should carry out an advertising campaign during the coming four weeks, emphasising safety issues and the potential dangers of counterfeit toys.  There are a number of fake toys on the market and this should be highlighted, as well as the need for people to purchase from reputable shops and suppliers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400006#E00600","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1354632900,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Will the Leader arrange a debate with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, on the decoupling of Shannon Airport from the DAA?

Earlier today I heard someone state on radio that it would make no difference as to whether the tax is \u20ac300 or \u20ac5,000 because they did not have the money to pay.<\/p><p>We are going backwards in time.  Last week I referred to evictions and soup kitchens.  James Fintan Lalor may as well have never existed because we are punishing people for improving their properties.  Citizens are not even safe when they are dead.  It used to be stated that death and taxes are the only certainties but now one is not even secure in one's grave because the grave-robbers will be after one in respect of payments that have been deferred.  This is absolutely obscene.  Why is this happening?  It is because the Finance Ministers of France and Germany, whose banks we bailed out - we did not have to do so but we did - by stupidly paying the debts they had ignorantly and foolishly run up by pouring money into this country, have said &quot;No, no, no&quot;.  They are being aided and abetted in this regard by the appropriately named Herr Juncker.  We are due to pay \u20ac3.5 billion to the Central Bank early next year and then this money will be technically destroyed.  It will be as if it never existed.  Why not cease making such payments and staunch the flow of moneys out of the Exchequer?  While we are at it, what is the point in celebrating the 1916 Rising?  We are obviously travelling backwards rather than forwards.  Let us celebrate 1816 and hedge schools, famine, evictions, etc.<\/p><p>I would welcome the opportunity to debate abortion in the House.

I appreciate the House will debate the expert group's report this Thursday.  However, quite frankly I do not think that will be enough.  This is my personal view because my party has yet to formulate a policy on this.  Ultimately, it will need to be brought before the people.  We have gone to the people on two occasions in the past.  It is the people who are sovereign, not the Parliament.  We are not Britain which does not have a written constitution and where Parliament is sovereign.  The people are sovereign in this Republic.  I cannot see any way out of the dilemma now facing the Government.  It can legislate until the cows come home. <\/p> <p>The Government of the day has to deal with it but it will not be done through legislation.  There are Members who have a diametrically opposed view from mine on where this debate will go and if they believe that the people will stand by and allow the legislators to decide, we will end up with abortion on demand because that is what has happened in both Britain and America where the argument moved from the physical to the psychological.  Once that happened, it opened the floodgates.<\/p><p>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to the House early in the new year to discuss his proposals for the abolition of local development companies throughout the State?  In theory it sounds great to merge services locally.  I have become a convert to the concept of partnership development companies over the past decade.  I started off, like many of us who served on local authorities, believing that they were shadow local authorities that had no public mandate but the volume of work they do on social inclusion and on worthy projects in every county will be lost, as will the expertise and architecture that has been built over the past decade, if they are merged with local authorities.

We hear of people going to bed at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. because they have no heating in the house.  Parents are sickened at the sight of their children not having sufficient food.  As Senator Norris correctly said, it is a reflection of what we went through in the 1950s and not just the 1800s.  There is no point in us making suggestions regarding the budget but I have one hope, which is the Government will live up to its promise that those who can pay the most will do so.  In addition, those who have no money should not be pursued, coerced and terrified by the fact that they cannot pay a household charge or whatever other charge may come down the line.  They have enough to suffer about without doing that.

I was listening to late night radio while I was travelling last Saturday night and a speaker referred to one figure from the recent poll.  The figure fitted a particular agenda.  It was 24 hours later before the second figure, which is contradictory of the earlier figure, was brought into the public domain.  That is not the way for a public broadcasting service or anybody who is genuine about this case to behave.  The psychological and mental health issue is important.  Let us inform ourselves about it.  I am delighted that Dr. Patricia Casey and Paul Brady will be in the AV room today to discuss the mental health aspect of this issue.  Members who have time and an interest in it should, as legislators, go to the AV room 4.30 p.m. to inform themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400011#K00800","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354635300,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Would it be in order to welcome the return of Senator Healy Eames from China?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400012#L00200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1354635300,"counter":94,"content":"<p>That is completely out of order.

Ireland West Airport is absolutely essential for the development of the west of Ireland and it must be supported and developed by this Government.  There must be a level playing pitch.

The difficulty is that the banks say they are operating within the law.  That is an interpretation of the law.  Our role is to change the law and that can be easily done.<\/p><p>There are three items that can be put in place either by ministerial order or a simple Private Members' Bill, to which we can all be party.  First, a representative of the county sheriff must be present on every occasion when property is being repossessed.  Second, it must be done by appointment and, third, it must be done during working hours.  No more should people have to jump out of their beds, believing somebody is breaking into their property and stealing property that belongs to them.  It is easy to stand up and parade everybody but I would like to see an all-party motion come from the Seanad.  Too often we say the House is irrelevant.  Let us be relevant on this issue.  I am sure, with the Leader's consent, that with whoever is next up for Private Members' business we could draft a simple Bill if this cannot be done by ministerial order.

The decision will grant the airport long-awaited freedom to determine its future in its best interests and those of the Shannon region.  The decision is to separate the airport from the Dublin Airport Authority, merge it with a new entity which will also include a restructured Shannon Development and its extensive landbank.  It represents a new beginning for the Shannon region and involves a drive to develop a world class aviation industry and a restructuring of the tourism and enterprise support agencies in the region to support this goal.  Shannon Airport will be made independent of the Dublin Airport Authority and merged with Shannon Development.  With the support of the national enterprise, investment and tourism agencies and a new focus on the development of aviation services, it will have a long overdue new beginning.  The decision has been welcomed by many.  There is no question of not having a level playing field for Ireland West Airport Knock.  It is recognised that the decision will result in increased competition among Irish airports, including Knock.  However, the aim is to increase the overall number of passengers into the country through increased efficiencies and the attraction of new aviation business which could have a beneficial impact nationally.

I hope we will not be discussing a break up of the south east hospital network and that it will remain intact.<\/p><p>Senator Healy Eames called for a further debate on the expert group.  As I stated, two and a half hours have been allocated on Thursday and I will provide further time if more speakers are offering.  I wish to point out that the Joint Committee on Health and Children will meet on 8, 9 and 10 January to accept submissions on the expert group report.  There will be no rushing or lack of debate; there will be plenty of debate in the House.  The Joint Committee on Health and Children will debate the issue and action will be taken by the Government as soon as we have all the information before us.<\/p><p>Senator Healy Eames also spoke about the use of pension funds invested abroad.  That is another matter which she could raise with the Minister during statements on the budget tomorrow evening.<\/p><p>Senators Wilson, D'Arcy, \u00d3 Domhnaill and others raised the difficulties of constituents with regard to financial institutions.  One Member highlighted that there was damage to property in order to gain access.  If there was damage to property, that is an offence and it should be investigated by the Garda, but I do not have full knowledge of it.  Senator D'Arcy also spoke about introducing legislation to the House.  It is the prerogative of any Member to introduce legislation and we must examine any legislation based on its content.  Anyway, I can understand the anger of Members with regard to the activities of some financial institutions and the manner in which they are trying to get back money.  I fully understand the feelings of Members.  Banks say they are operating within the law.  That has to be challenged and if they are operating within the law, then, obviously, by doing what they are purported to have done in Wexford and Cavan, we will have to do something to address it.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett raised the issue of Shannon Airport, which I have already commented on.  We will have the opportunity to discuss it again next week.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney raised the possible need for a referendum on abortion.  We will debate the expert group first.  He suggested that the Supreme Court judgment was flawed.<\/p> <p>I question the making of such statements in the House.  <\/p><p>On development companies operating under the umbrella of local authorities, for many years people have been calling for a one-stop shop.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is due to come to the House on 22 January to discuss the issue of local government reform, as requested by Senator Diarmuid Wilson and others, and the matter can be raised during that discussion.  <\/p><p>In response to the point made by Senator Labhr\u00e1s \u00d3 Murch\u00fa, the budget will be announced tomorrow and whether it is fair will be up for discussion.  Some will probably think it is, while others will have a different opinion, as is the case with all budgets.  <\/p><p>I have addressed the matters raised by Senators Brian \u00d3 Domhnaill and Michael D'Arcy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400015#O00300","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354637100,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Credit Union Bill 2012: Second Stage","time":1354637100,"counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400016#P00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354637100,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1354637100,"counter":151,"content":"<p>As is well known, the Credit Union Bill 2012 is very important legislation, coming at an important time for credit unions.  It is key step towards placing the credit union movement on a sustainable path for the longer term.  It implements over 60 recommendations made in the report of the Commission on Credit Unions which was agreed to by key stakeholders, including credit union representatives.  The commission was specifically reconvened to examine the general scheme of the Bill and ensure its fidelity to the commission's report.  The agreed report sets out a roadmap for the viability of credit unions into the future and its constituent elements are interlinked and mutually reinforced.  The report is focused on what is needed for the credit union system.  It does not apply banking thinking; nor does it slavishly import models from other international credit union movements.  The taxpayer has committed to providing funding of \u20ac500 million for credit unions at a time when resources are very scarce.  This significant financial commitment on behalf of taxpayers during a period of austerity must bring about a stable, well governed credit union movement that can sustain itself into the future.  <\/p><p>The commission's report makes it clear that the adverse economic conditions in Ireland have resulted in a decline in credit union performance.  While the financial challenges faced by credit unions are evident, they are not insurmountable.  However, they reinforce the clear need to reform how credit unions are structured, governed and regulated.  The commission highlights a number of vulnerabilities in the sector.  Concern remains about the high level of arrears and the need to ensure loan losses are recognised and provided for.  The low dividend rates across the sector are not sustainable in the longer term.<\/p> <p> The cost to income ratio of credit unions has increased considerably in recent years, going from approximately 50% in 2006 to almost 90% in 2011.  The loan to asset ratio was at only 40% at the end of 2011, an historical low.  The Bill is an important part of the Government's response to these challenges.  It also provides the platform for restructuring, improving systems, the provision of additional services and governance structures that are sound and forward-looking.<\/p><p>The Bill covers four broad areas.  The first element deals with the prudential requirements that apply to credit unions across a range of areas, including reserves, liquidity, investments, lending and borrowing.  In general, the Bill sets out the policies and principles, with provision for Central Bank regulations setting out standards and procedures.  This will facilitate the development of a prudential rule book which will provide clarity for credit unions on the requirements that apply to them.  The second main element relates to governance.  The core function and focus of this part of the Bill is on bringing clarity to and distinguishing between the role of the board, on the one hand, and the role of the executive, on the other.  Boards will be the key decision-making organ of credit unions, focused on strategy and policy, with the management team handling the day-to-day operations of the credit union, subject to board oversight.  Importantly, the Bill preserves and respects the volunteer ethos of credit unions and provides better opportunities for training and development of credit union volunteers.<\/p><p>The next element is the restructuring of credit unions on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis, overseen by the credit union restructuring board, or ReBo.  The ReBo has been established on an administrative basis ahead of the legislation, with Mr. Bobby McVeigh as chairman - a hugely experienced and respected figure in the international credit union movement.  The ReBo is working to the timetable in the commission's report which envisages the process being completed by the end of 2015.  The Bill also provides for statutory stabilisation of credit unions which is to be fully funded by the credit union movement itself, via a levy, as recommended in the commission's report.  Stabilisation will operate on a more limited basis during the restructuring period.<\/p><p>I would like to highlight some of the main provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 includes the preliminary and general provisions, including the Short Title, interpretation and the commencement provisions.  Part 2 deals with two main areas, regulatory requirements and governance.  In terms of regulatory requirements, regulations must be effective and proportionate, having regard to the nature, scale and complexity of the credit unions to which they apply.  This will facilitate the development of a tiered regulatory approach as recommended by the commission.<\/p><p>Section 29 provides that before introducing regulations, the Central Bank will be required to consult the Minister for Finance, the credit union advisory committee and other credit union bodies.  Though not specifically required in legislation, this consultation is to be done in accordance with a consultation protocol which has been published by the Central Bank following consultation with stakeholders.  Regulations will also be subject to regulatory impact analysis requirements.<\/p><p>Section 7 amends section 6 of the Credit Union Act 1997 to provide that the Central Bank may impose conditions on the registration of a credit union.  These are appealable to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.  <\/p><p>Section 11 amends section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 regarding lending.  It provides that the ability of the loan applicant to repay shall be the primary consideration in the underwriting process.  There is also provision for Central Bank regulations on classes of lending in which a credit union may engage, large exposures and concentration limits.<\/p><p>Section 12 amends section 43 of the Credit Union Act 1997 with regard to the investments that credit unions can undertake.  Detailed matters such as classes and quality of investments, maturities and limits are to be provided for in Central Bank regulations.  <\/p><p>Section 13 amends section 45 of the Credit Union Act 1997 on the regulatory reserve requirement and operational risk reserves, with a further role for Central Bank regulations in setting out the minimum levels to apply.<\/p><p>Section 30 sets out the liquidity requirements that apply, with provision for Central Bank regulations on minimum liquidity requirements, including maturity mismatches and stress testing.<\/p> <p>Section 30 sets out the liquidity requirements that apply, with provision for Central Bank regulations on minimum liquidity requirements, including maturity mismatches and stress testing.  Section 14 of the Bill sets out the provisions which may be appealed to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal, including regulatory directions.  The Minister has asked his Department to look at any consequential changes needed to the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 to ensure the principal avenue of appeal for regulatory directions issued to credit unions under that legislation is the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal rather than the High Court.<\/p><p>The other broad question dealt with in the Bill is governance.  Obviously, the Bill provides clarity on the roles and responsibilities of the chair, board and management of credit unions.  In accordance with the agreed recommendations of the Commission on Credit Unions, section 15 provides that the number of board members is to be between seven and 11 and also provides for term limits.  The Minister has decided that the term limits provided for under the Bill should be extended to 12 years, in aggregate, in any given 15-year period.  Exclusions from board membership are provided for in accordance with the commission's recommendations.  The Minister has indicated his intention to amend the Bill in respect of certain exclusions.  This section is also developmental in the sense that it makes specific provisions for the training of volunteer directors.<\/p><p>Section 17 of the Bill amends section 55 of the Credit Union Act 1997.  It specifies that the functions of the board include setting the direction of the credit union, operating a comprehensive decision-making process and ensuring an effective management team is in place.  The board is also responsible for approving, reviewing and updating all plans, policies and procedures of a credit union.  The Minister has agreed to an amendment to provide for a member of the board to present the accounts at the AGM.  This role was previously performed by the treasurer.  The governance provisions in sections 18 to 26 of the Bill deal with matters such as: the role of the chair of the board; committees, including the nomination committee; conflicts of interest; risk management, including the risk management officers; compliance officers; business continuity planning; information systems; outsourcing; and the role of the manager.  Section 26 also provides that the internal audit functions within a credit union will provide for independent internal oversight and evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the credit union's risk management, internal controls and governance processes.<\/p><p>Section 27 of the Bill provides for the board oversight committees, which will form a crucial pillar in the new governance assessment of the board's performance.  The board oversight committee is the next evolution of the supervisory committees which have been operating in credit unions for many years.  As the role of the board changes towards a more strategic focus, it is important that the role of the supervisory committee changes with it.  The Bill sets out a number of important provisions regarding the board oversight committee.  It will have access at all times to the books and documents of a credit union, including drafts.  Its members will have the right to attend board meetings.  It may notify the Central Bank of any issues or concerns about non-compliance by the board with applicable requirements.  It will report to the members at the AGM or SGM on whether the board has complied with its requirements.  The Minister has agreed that the changes on term limits and membership regarding the board should be mirrored with respect to the board oversight committee.<\/p><p>Part 3 of the Bill deals with restructuring, which will be carried out on a voluntary, time-bound and incentivised basis and will be overseen by the credit union restructuring board, to be known as ReBo.  Restructuring will involve a process of amalgamations or transfers of engagement under Part 9 of the Credit Union Act 1997.  The guiding aims of restructuring are the protection of credit union members' savings, the stability and viability of credit unions and the sector at large and the preservation of the credit union identity and unique ethos.  This Part provides for the establishment of ReBo on a time-bound basis.  It will comprise a chair and board, supported by an operational side.<\/p> <p>The board of ReBo was established on an administrative basis on 31 August this year and has already met three times to lay the groundwork for restructuring.  ReBo's role is as follows: To engage with credit unions on the ground to facilitate agreement on restructuring proposals; to assist credit unions in the preparation of restructuring plans; and to consider restructuring plans submitted to it, including any funding requirements, and approve or reject those plans.  ReBo will also oversee the implementation of restructuring plans, including the provision of post-restructuring support.  ReBo may also make a recommendation to the bank that an individual credit union should be considered for stabilisation.<\/p><p>ReBo will be funded up-front and a levy on the sector by ReBo will recover 50% of its operational costs.  The Bill establishes a credit union fund to fund restructuring and stabilisation.  Once the Bill is enacted, it is intended that \u20ac250 million will be contributed to the credit union fund from the Exchequer to cover restructuring costs.  The costs of stabilisation will be met entirely by a levy on the credit union sector itself, as agreed by the Commission on Credit Unions.  Restructuring and stabilisation funding is recoupable from the benefiting credit unions, with provision for any shortfall in the recoupment of restructuring costs to be met by a levy on the sector.<\/p><p>Part 4 of the Bill deals with the very important question of the stabilising of credit unions on a stand-alone basis where they are viable and hold reserves above 7.5%.  The Central Bank must have regard to a number of key factors before approving the provision of stabilisation, including the extent of the credit union's compliance with regulatory requirements and its ability to maintain reserves and fund the business for up to three years after the support has been provided.  To avoid any disconnect during the period of restructuring, a credit union will need a ReBo recommendation before it can be considered by the Central Bank for stabilisation during the restructuring period.  This requirement will no longer apply once ReBo has been dissolved.  Part 4 also provides for the establishment of a stabilisation committee to examine the implementation by the Central Bank of its own requirements and procedures under stabilisation.<\/p><p>The Schedule to the Bill deals with a range of miscellaneous amendments recommended by the Commission on Credit Unions and those which arise as a consequence of amendments made in other parts of this Bill.<\/p><p>A number of very important issues were raised in the context of the debate that ensued on all Stages in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.  Where possible, the Minister has tried to show some flexibility without compromising on the core principles of the Bill.  As the Minister has explained, the intention is to bring forward a number of substantive amendments on Committee Stage of proceedings in this House.  This will, of course, require that the Bill is referred back to the D\u00e1il in due course for consideration.  I was responsible for taking some of Report Stage in the other House.  Quite a number of very sensible ideas were put forward in the select committee and on Report Stage by Deputies on all sides.  The Minister for Finance gave an assurance to the House that, for the purposes of Committee Stage in this House, the Government will be proposing quite a number of substantive amendments to reflect those ideas that emerged on Committee Stage and Report Stage, and also to reflect a new consensus that has emerged on all sides in terms of making this Bill more effective when it is up and running.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400016#P00500","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354638000,"counter":155,"content":"<p>Will the Minister of State explain some of the general areas they will cover?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400019#S00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1354638000,"counter":156,"content":"<p>We can do that in the course of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400019#S00300","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1354638000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>When does the Minister of State expect that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400019#S00400","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1354638000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I might just conclude first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400019#S00500","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1354638000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>It would be immensely helpful if the Minister of State could provide that information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400019#S00600","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1354638000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I will certainly do that in my summation on Second Stage - I give my word on that.<\/p><p>With regard to some of the issues that may arise, the definition of financial services legislation has been misunderstood.  However, it should be possible to nuance the definition to clarify that we are talking about the range of requirements that apply to credit unions rather than a wider application of financial services legislation generally.  On term limits, which is another issue raised in the D\u00e1il, it is important that the core principle of board rotation is retained - in other words, that people would move on.<\/p> <p>However, the move to 12 years in 15 should strike a balance between continuity on the one hand and renewal on the other during the period of regeneration that lies ahead.  The Minister has also agreed in principle to some changes regarding the exclusions from board membership where he has been satisfied that to do so would not give rise to undue concern about conflicts of interest, which is another issue that was raised.  However, it is important to emphasise that volunteers may progress to a position on the board provided that they do not hold both positions at the same time.<\/p><p>A number of people have raised the importance of shared services.  The Minister has reiterated the Government's position in support of this, which is in line with what is proposed in the commission report.  He has also requested a report from the Credit Union Advisory Committee on shared branching which will allow for a further analysis of this concept and a recommendation on how best to proceed.<\/p><p>I take this opportunity to inform Senators that I expect to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage which are unrelated to credit unions.  These amendments are required to permit the Central Bank to sign the International Organisation of Securities Commissions' multilateral memorandum of understanding, MMOU, by the end of the year.  In light of the pressing end of year timeline for signing the MMOU, it is necessary to make these amendments to the Bill.  The amendments do not relate to the credit union sector.  The purpose of the MMOU is to allow the Central Bank to co-operate and share information with other regulators, including other securities commissions around the world, in accordance with international best practise.  The provisions concerned are currently part of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011, Committee Stage of which is due to be taken in January.  The changes envisaged include, enacting section 53 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill so that the Central Bank may use its powers on behalf of overseas regulators, enhanced and consolidated authorised officers and related provisions regarding the Central Bank confidentiality regime.  Given that these amendments are not related to credit unions, it will be necessary to amend the short and the long Titles to this Bill to accommodate them.<\/p><p>I would like to emphasise that the process of reform will require leadership at all levels of the credit union movement.  The focus must remain on what is best for credit union members and the safety of their savings.  It is important that credit unions embrace the changes ahead.  I know that there is strong support for the credit union movement on all sides of the House.  The debate on the Bill so far has enabled a positive and constructive discussion on the future of the credit union movement.  I look forward to hearing Senators' views in the course of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400019#S00700","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354638600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom an tAire St\u00e1it a fh\u00e1ilti\u00fa go dt\u00ed an Seanad ar\u00eds inniu.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the Seanad to debate this important Bill and for setting out the Government's position regarding the substantial amendments to be made to this Bill on Committee Stage.  I look forward to debating them.  When the Minister of State mentioned the amendments I had anticipated that discussion on the Bill would be dragged out a little.  However, in light of what he said subsequently about the unrelated Central Bank matters, I suspect that will not happen.<\/p><p>Fianna F\u00e1il recognises and supports the role of credit unions in terms of their fulfilling a hugely valuable function throughout this country, having more than \u20ac15 billion in customer deposits.  Unlike many other financial institutions, credit unions are open for business and are still providing loans to members, including to small businesses.  This should be fully acknowledged in the debate on the future of the sector.  What should also be fully acknowledged is that unlike when a bank that goes bust, when a credit union goes bust there is no threat to the viability of the State.  If something goes wrong it might possibly have reputational consequences but the magnitude of the damage will be so much less than that caused by the banks to this State yet their role is, in many ways, far more important with banks throughout Ireland closing their branch networks, in particular the Government owned bank, AIB.  Credit unions operate in literally every parish in this country.  They are run by volunteers in the community for the community.<\/p> <p>In this day and age when the economic climate is so tough, increasing numbers of communities are getting together to work at various initiatives in their areas.  Often the credit union is at the centre of those initiatives, whether through sponsorship or by providing expertise or even an office for people to do their work.  In Senator Quinn's Local Heroes initiative around the country it is evident credit unions have played a particularly important role in the way this movement has panned out in different communities throughout Ireland.  <\/p><p>In spite of the difficulties that we acknowledge have occurred in the credit union sector, they have shown a determination to retain their character, identity and voluntary, not for profit and community ethos.  As this legislation goes through the House that must be at the heart of all our debate and thinking.  That is not to forget the mistakes and, in some cases, wrong actions taken by a very small number of credit unions, such as advancing loans that supported what may have been unsustainable property development.  However, that cannot detract from the good of the credit union movement.  I believe we can so describe it.  The actual sector is in excellent shape.  Some credit unions are in need of stabilisation and there have been some injections of State money.  However, this has been nothing like the scale of what happened in the banking sector, and is only a small fraction of the money involved.  As a State, we should be proud to be able to provide that amount to the credit union movement when a small number of its members get into trouble.<\/p><p>The volunteerism of the movement must be preserved by this legislation.  The Irish League of Credit Unions and my colleagues in the D\u00e1il reflected their concerns about what this Bill might do to volunteerism.  As I understand it, the Minister has accepted those concerns and we look forward with interest to the amendments he will put before us on Committee Stage.  This Bill has been ongoing for some time.  There was a commission report and there were hearings at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have taken a lot of time with it.  If the Minister needs to push this Bill through before Christmas it might well be done in a rush.  All Governments do this before terms wind down.  I would be concerned that Members in either this House, or the D\u00e1il, to which these amendments must return, or members of the credit union sector would not have time to digest the amendments, look at what is stated, debate them thoroughly and, in our case, vote for or against them as they deserve, according to our opinions.<\/p><p>I am concerned that we may not have enough time to do this if there is a need to rush the other part of the Bill.  I wonder if that part could be put through as a single-item Bill in order to allow us a little more reflection, without creating undue delay to the credit union matters.  If that could be done as a single-item, one-page Bill on the Central Bank issue, my party would be willing to work to that.  It does not seem to be necessary to rush through before Christmas what looks like a major amendment to the Credit Union Bill.  People will want to study and examine it to see what are the implications.  It is important that there is some engagement between Government and the credit union sector in advance of these amendments coming before the Seanad.  I hope that will take place because we will not have much time to talk about them in this House.<\/p><p>We want to see Irish credit unions being in the first division of the international credit union movement, with the Government and its agencies as supportive partners.  We want to see credit unions providing funding to Government-backed or guaranteed schemes or projects that have a social benefit, and we want to see the State avoiding the placement of significant regulatory costs on credit unions.  Of course, the State needs to balance the interests of savers and borrowers.  There is a delicate balancing act involved but we always need to be conscious of the volunteer effort without which, in some cases, our communities would not even exist.  I thank the people throughout Ireland who serve as directors, staff and volunteers in credit unions.  They are doing a marvellous job and I am delighted that the Minister has taken on board some of their genuine concerns.  I reiterate I would not like to see the legislation rushed in the coming weeks which may be unnecessary.  We want to see the volunteer aspect of the credit union movement preserved in legislation.  We look forward to Committee Stage and will be constructive if the Minister takes on board many of the concerns we have expressed on behalf of the movement.  Many of his colleagues have also done so.  We genuinely support the Bill but will wait to see what is contained in the particular amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400020#T00200","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354639500,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.

It is also welcome that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, is prepared to take on board a large number of amendments to it.<\/p><p>The credit union movement is perhaps one of the best examples of the work done within the voluntary sector in Ireland.  It is organised and almost like a terrorist organisation in that it operates on the basis of a cell structure.  Each cell is independent but overseen by others.  The work done by credit unions is superb and I am satisfied that we are going to need a lively, strong and vibrant credit union sector.<\/p><p>I wish to outline my experience of the credit union movement in the 1980s when I was a teenager.  I recall that those who were members of credit unions at that stage were not those for whom the latter were originally established.  Every person involved in business throughout the country was then a member of a credit union because, as is the case now, the banks were not lending.  Those to whom I refer needed money to keep their businesses going and they obtained it from their credit unions.  At present, the banks are not extending credit to businesses and people are again seeking money from their credit unions.  It is often forgotten but the only way out of the economic morass in which we find ourselves is through the creation of jobs.  Credit unions are providing the vital lifelines - in the form of cashflow - which people need and the banks are not making available.<\/p><p>I made the point last week that the reduction in the amount of the banks' liabilities covered under the ELG from \u20ac375 billion to \u20ac78 billion in four years was probably too great.  The reduction in exceptional liquidity assistance from the ECB and the Central Bank from \u20ac186 billion to less than \u20ac100 billion is probably also too great.  It is too much to expect the banks to lend when reductions of this order have been made.  The expectation was that the two pillar banks were to lend \u20ac3.5 billion each, but when one considers this matter in the context of the reductions relating to the ELG and the ELA to which I refer, one can see who is losing out.  The credit union sector is picking up the slack in this regard.<\/p><p>It is welcome that changes are going to be made on Committee Stage.  I look forward to discovering what these changes will be and have no doubt that they will be the subject of much discussion.  <\/p><p>The Minister of State has indicated that section 11 amends section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 regarding lending and that &quot;It provides that the ability of the loan applicant to repay shall be the primary consideration in the underwriting process.&quot;  That is my major concern about the Bill.  The one thing the credit union sector has retained is knowledge of its customers.  This is not the case with the banks which have excluded the knowledge to which I refer.  It does not matter what information a branch manager sends to the underwriters employed in a bank's headquarters.  They do not care because they operate on the basis of criteria and mathematical formulae.  If such criteria and formulae are not satisfied, the bank will not lend.  I am not referring to reckless lending in this regard; rather, I am concerned about the exclusion of knowledge.  Such knowledge is local in nature and indicates that a person or his or her sons and daughters have always paid their debts.  The local authorities, of which the Minister of State and I were once members, also possess such knowledge.  This knowledge allows credit unions and local authorities to identify the families which always pay.  If the position is tightened to such a degree that we remove the local knowledge and experience possessed by credit unions, I am concerned that they will go the way of the banks and no longer be able to loan people money.<\/p> <p>It is a concern which I hope officials will note and respond to on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>I attended the opening of the credit union in Gorey, which was a lovely occasion.  The facility was opened by the Nobel Peace Prize winner, Mr. John Hume, and it was one of those days when one saw the community at is best.  <\/p><p>The credit union sector must be given the opportunity to advance into the digital age so that branches do not exclusively operate under the cell network.  While they can continue to operate within the cell network, with oversight, provision must be made for linkages between branches, so as to strengthen the sector and make it more flexible.  If a member has a credit union card, he or she should be able to withdraw cash from any branch in a network, be it in Westport, Letterkenny, Rosslare or Castlehaven.  We need more flexibility and to allow the credit unions to embrace the digital age.<\/p><p>The restructuring of the boards can only be a good thing but I am concerned about how the restructuring will be advanced and facilitated.  I would not be in favour of restructuring on the basis that one branch does not want to merge with another.  Credit unions must be reasonable about such matters and simply not wanting to merge with another branch is not a good enough excuse.  However, if one branch is steadfastly against merging with another, provision must be made to give it a hearing.  I welcome the Bill overall and look forward to examining it in more detail.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400022#V00400","speaker":"1160","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354639800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  I have always been envious of friends and colleagues who are members of credit unions because they seem to be an efficient and socially welcome method of obtaining credit.  There has always been a feeling of community about credit unions which is admirable.  The same was true in the early days of building societies, when they were mutual societies, prior to being de-mutualised and privatised.<\/p><p>In general, I am very supportive of credit unions and of making them fit for purpose in these very difficult days.  The days are difficult for credit unions, as was made clear with the establishment of the Commission on Credit Unions and the delivery of its report.  Most of us have been lobbied by representatives of the credit union movement and indeed, I believe some of them are in the Public Gallery today.  They are very welcome to Seanad \u00c9ireann.  I cannot say I agree with all of their worries and perhaps they were a little overheated.  <\/p><p>To follow on from what Senator D'Arcy said, I was contacted some time ago by a woman who was involved with her local credit union and she expressed precisely the same concern expressed by the Senator at the end of his contribution about the prospect of forced mergers.  I welcome the suggestion that there should be some discussion on any such proposition because, at the end of the day, human elements are involved.  We are providing very significant sums of money, through the taxpayer, to credit unions and we are, therefore, responsible for the way in which that is discharged.  There is no doubt that in implementing more than 60 recommendations of the commission, the main aim is to insulate the credit unions against the very difficult storms that are currently raging.  A sum of \u20ac500 million is being provided.<\/p><p>In addition to the briefings I had with the credit unions I also got a very interesting document from a former colleague in this House, Joe O'Toole, which I found very useful.  <\/p> <p>He adumbrates the background history.  An interim report was published, public consultation was undertaken and the Commission invited and received submissions from the public and the credit unions themselves.  They surveyed every credit union and nobody was denied a hearing.  It was a fully democratic process at that stage.  The report was agreed unanimously.  It was acclaimed and welcomed by all the organisations comprising the Irish League of Credit Unions.  Then it was reconvened to make suggestions about the Credit Union Bill 2012 we are debating.  An implementation group was established.  With this type of legislation, it is critical to have an implementation group so that it does not just remain on a shelf but that some group is charged with the implementation of the Bill.<\/p><p>When one considers the circumstances with which the implementation group and the Government were confronted - although the credit unions are and continue to be an excellent and vital part of our economic life - a series of problems emerge such as arrears, debt write offs, capitalisation issues and very large sums, perhaps up to \u20ac1 billion were tied up in this.  In 2011, credit union arrears were more than \u20ac1 billion and bad debt provision was more than \u20ac800,000, without taking into account capitalisation requirements.  That suggests a serious and threatening situation in credit unions which the commission was set up to address, and which the Minister addresses in the Bill.<\/p><p>The concerns expressed in the correspondence I received have been of a significant number but at least - thanks to the Minister indicating he is accepting and tabling amendments - some are being addressed, in particular the terms of service.  It is appropriate that there should be a turnover of personnel on the board, and that opens up the whole administration to new volunteerism.  It is not intended to stifle volunteerism.  I gather in the initial proposal one would serve on the board for nine years and after nine years, one would be precluded for a significant period from serving again on the board.  The credit unions lobbied for this to be amended to 12 years and the Minister has accepted that proposal.  That seems to be a reasonable and good compromise.  It is appropriate that there is also a clear separation between the board and executive functions.  The idea of a volunteer treasurer handling everything and being responsible for everything gives rise to a conflict of interests.  What the Government is doing in the Bill is appropriate, particularly when we take into account that very significant sums of taxpayers money are involved.  There may be some confusion.  One of the suggested amendments states - it does not seem to be an amendment - the League Board believes the new legislation should support credit union electronically enabled payments by all possible means.  That is not an amendment, it is an exhortation.  The situation, as I understand it, is that there is nothing to stop them doing it at present.  They have the capacity and a number of credit unions provide these electronic facilities.  It is very important, particularly with regard to small branches, that there is some degree of training and we must ensure the personnel are capable and the facility is up to standard.  There is no point in having substandard provisions.<\/p> <p>They are already supported in providing electronic services to their customers and that should continue.  However, it should not continue willy-nilly.  Historically, treasurers were elected to positions where they had very significant powers over very large sums of money while they may not have had any great professional skills or background in the management of such large sums of money or these complex organisations.  This Bill proposes placing the executive function within the remit of the executive - the manager - with the board having powers of hiring and firing if he or she does not perform or report appropriately.  I completely support that.  <\/p><p>On the Central Bank legislation, the Minister in his speech has cleared up some misunderstandings.  It is not a question of taking some large antiquated block of legislation and dumping it on the heads of the credit unions.  The regulator for the credit unions, for example, who is centrally important, is established under Central Bank legislation so the Central Bank has to be involved.  There is some resistance to regulation, some suggestion that regulation might be stifling.  The difficulty in the financial sector has been light regulation or none at all.  This very valuable area of our commercial life must be regulated properly.  I hope there will be a fair amount of accord in this regard.  The credit unions believed they were being insulted, that some of the regulations were burdensome and intolerable.  This language suggests a degree of difficulty which is surprising, considering they were involved in the process at the beginning, that it was unanimously recommended that it be open at all stages and that the process on which the Minister embarked is perfectly rational in implementing the main recommendations - if not all - of the body consulted.  We have a responsibility to the taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400023#W00200","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354640400,"counter":172,"content":"<p>The Senator's time is expired.

The credit union sector has proven to be the only part of the financial sector to come out well from our recent self-inflicted disasters which have befallen the financial services and the country.

Senator D'Arcy referred to the corporate memory that has been lost in the banking system.  Members of credit unions are well known to the risk management committees who make the lending decisions.  This is commendable and is in stark contrast to the crowd of idiots who were running the other financial institutions.  I call them \"eejits\" because they are financial idiots.  During the years of the credit boom, these men - they were primarily men - decided that the basic laws of finance no longer applied to them.  They decided that they had found a formula which freed them from taking into account even the most basic rules of prudential risk management.  As Senator Norris will know, the ancient Greeks had a word for this - hubris - meaning that mortals were wiser than the gods.  The difference is that the revenge of the Olympic gods fell on the heroes whereas the revenge of the financial gods does not seem to have affected our financial heroes but instead every member of the public is affected and the country has been more or less destroyed.  Our Irish heroes were swanning around the country receiving the acclamation of other Irish heroes such as the politicians and commentators.

When these bankers were living it up, the managers of local credit unions were going about their business, quietly working away to meet the modest needs of modest people and no Act could ever endanger this.  We must be cognisant of this.<\/p><p>In welcoming the Bill we need to take into consideration the nature of credit unions and in our attempts to improve their operation we need to take care that our actions will not have unintended consequences.  As we amend the regulatory framework for the setting of requirements, we must not make changes to force the credit union movement to be something other than it is and move it away from its core role as a provider of credit locally.  The Minister has consulted widely on the legislation and the deliberations of the Commission on Credit Unions have resulted in the main provisions of the legislation, while the Irish League of Credit Unions has campaigned for this regulatory framework.<\/p><p>A number of sections provide that credit unions must comply with requirements under financial legislation, but the nature of this is not clear.  Perhaps the Minister of State might outline his thoughts on this issue.  This is a substantial Bill, comprising 96 sections, and it should take us a great deal of time on Committee Stage to fully reflect on and tease out its implications for this important sector in the financial services industry.<\/p><p>The role of credit unions in other countries is filled by local banks and most of the smaller banks have survived the financial chaos.  I urge caution and careful consideration, while bringing the Bill through the Oireachtas.  <\/p><p>Section 8 permits credit unions to raise funds by issuing shares.  Is there a risk that this could lead to the demutualisation of the movement, as happened with building societies, which led to significant damage?  <\/p><p>Section 10 provides that where a person who lends money to a credit union or accepts security on that loan where he or she knows the credit union is breaching its requirements, the debt and security are unenforceable.  I have reservations about this, as it provides for two undesirable courses of action.  In the first instance, it might permit credit unions to act outside their remit by specifically mentioning section 10 and, second, if the section stands, it might place an onerous burden on credit unions to demonstrate that they are acting within their remit.<\/p><p>The key stakeholders have agreed to most of the 60 recommendations, but, like Job in the Bible who was terrified by the gathering of the mob, I am always terrified by the gathering of consensus.  Has the Minister of State concerns about this?  Consensus is always dangerous and it is strange when we agree we need to be critical.  The role of the House is to fully tease out what we are doing and if two previous Seanaid had done their work properly, we might not be in the mess we are in.  It is important, therefore, that we be highly critical of changes to financial services regulation.  Has the Minister of State concerns about this consensus?  I am glad he said the Minister was taking on board proposals made on Committee and Report Stages in the Lower House.<\/p><p>I look forward to a full debate on Committee Stage.  We need to move with caution regarding a movement that has served the country well and continues to do so.  Sometimes in this country when the pendulum swings too far in one direction, we tend to jump in and ensure it swings too far back the other way.  Does the Minister of State believe the Bill is proportionate and that there is a need for these measures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400025#Y00800","speaker":"1117","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354641000,"counter":180,"content":"<p>Senator Gilroy could not resist the temptation to take another swipe at former Fianna F\u00e1il Ministers.  It would be remiss of me not to point out that former Deputy Charlie McCreevy was generally considered to be a reforming and successful Minister for Finance.  He went on to achieve further successes in Europe.  I will not discuss any other ex-Ministers for Finance.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Gilroy that the credit unions are a success story in Ireland.  That success story is in marked contrast to the failed story of their big brother counterparts in the major so-called pillar banks.  It is inevitable, but nonetheless ironic, that we are legislating for the regulation of credit unions at a time when their counterparts still appear to be skipping along their merry way and turning their noses up at the Irish people.  That is the context in which I will make my contribution on this Bill.  Credit unions have \u20ac15 billion in customer deposits, even in today's tough times.  A total of 2.9 million people in this country have deposits with credit unions.  It is the largest number in Europe, in percentage terms.  Credit unions are still giving out loans, although not as many as we would like, and are still in business.<\/p><p>In general, we welcome the Bill before the House.  Stabilisation is badly needed for a small number of credit unions.  It is a fact that 51 have reserves that are lower than the 10% standard and 25 of them are classified as being seriously under-capitalised.  It is worrying that the loan-to-asset ratio of credit unions in Ireland is at 40%, as opposed to the international norm of 70%.  These are the negative issues and they must be addressed.  However, the concept of credit unions is based on the ethos of volunteerism and a sense of service to a community.  I applaud the volunteers who are involved in credit unions and who have done such wonderful work.  The Minister acknowledges that.  The credit unions have always been a support to the small or low earner, the small businessman and the small farmer, who would probably be rejected everywhere else.  Their contribution to society, particularly in small towns in rural areas, is exemplary.<\/p><p>There was a controversy regarding a credit union in my home town of Listowel some years ago.  As with every controversy, there were two sides to the argument and it culminated in an extraordinary general meeting, EGM.  The meeting had to be moved from the Listowel Arms Hotel, which has catered for large conferences, race meetings, writers' weeks and the like, because so many people came to the meeting.  The manager had to cancel it on health and safety grounds.  It had to move to the gymnasium, which holds up to 1,000 people.  That sense of engagement on the part of ordinary people on an issue relating to their credit union demonstrates the sense of ownership people have towards their credit union.  The credit union in Listowel was and is strong and is getting stronger all the time.<\/p><p>Some of the governance issues in the Bill are a puzzle for me.  I welcome the amendment from 15 years to 12 years in respect of people stepping aside.  It is a pity that was not the case in the major banks previously.  There might have been a quicker turnover of bank managers at the top level and we would be much better off today.  However, is it ageist to say that a person has been in place for too long and must step aside?   There is much wisdom and experience with age so I hope that, under the rules, the expertise of the people who have given service and are then obliged to step aside will still be availed of and that they will still be able to have an input and, in due course, hopefully return to management or senior positions.<\/p><p>The legislation should not be anti-volunteerism.  There are certain exclusions from board membership but I understand from what the Minister has said that he is softening on that somewhat.  I welcome that.  There is also a financial consideration for credit unions under the Bill in that it requires that 0.2% be paid into the deposit guarantee scheme.  That will obviously make credit unions less competitive than heretofore.  They will also be required to dig deep to finance the costs that will be incurred in implementing the new audit and regulatory regime, which will cost money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400027#AA00100","speaker":"1142"},{"type":"speech","time":1354641300,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I always avail of the opportunity to contribute on the operations of credit unions because, as other speakers have said, their importance is reflected in the community.  I am an admirer of the credit unions in my constituency and the role they play, being rooted in the community and coming from a volunteer co-operative movement, a system of one member one vote where the board of directors is elected by the members.  They play a very important role in our communities in providing funding to individuals who would not necessarily want to get involved with banks.   Generally they are people of modest means with moderate or low incomes.  Credit unions provide financial services, loans and savings opportunities.  A movement with 3 million members and 400 registered credit unions must be respected.<\/p><p>The Bill is welcome.  It is important that those 3 million members have confidence in the regulatory regime and that the credit union in which they are involved is run properly for the sake of all its members.  Nobody would object to the regulatory regime being put on a firm footing.  As with all institutions, credit unions are not immune from the financial challenges of recent years although they have not experienced the same issues as the banks.  Since 2008 there has been a deterioration in some of the key financial indicators.  The Irish League of Credit Unions said it had a deficit of almost \u20ac46 million in 2010 compared with a surplus of \u20ac15 million in 2009.  The size of dividends paid by credit unions has been reducing.  Some 75% of credit unions paid a dividend to their members in 2010.  Some 12 months ago the Irish League of Credit Unions said the difficulties were having a direct effect on credit unions.  If people's incomes are reduced that has a direct effect on the number of financial transactions being entered into.  There were references to people buying property that would be perceived to be outside their remit but we do not have all the details.  However, the financial situation in the community must have a detrimental effect on credit unions.<\/p><p>Like other speakers I had been contacted by credit unions in my area and yesterday I had a further communication from them.  The three issues of concern have been addressed by the Minister but I look forward to discussing them on Committee Stage.  One issue was in respect of legislation and the definition of &quot;financial services legislation&quot;.  The Minister stated that he will clarify those that would be required by credit unions rather than financial services legislation generally.  I hope that will satisfy the concerns.<\/p><p>On the issue of terms for board members, I had long discussions with members.  There is also the issue of corporate memory.  It will be welcomed that the term for same has gone from nine to 12 years because a certain level of expertise has developed and it is important that is continued. <\/p> <p>A certain level of expertise has developed and it is important that we continue to support it.  This does not take from the fact that we need rotation, fresh blood, new ideas and the opportunity for new expertise to be brought on board.<\/p><p>The issues of shared services and electronic transfers are relevant.  From what I know and understand some credit unions operate using these facilities and there is no legislative or statutory prohibition from using electronic transfers or shared services.  It is an issue for discussion on Committee Stage and the Minister of State has acknowledged as much in his statement.<\/p><p>It is important that the credit union movement continues to grow, especially since many banks are closing down in our communities.  We should continue to support the credit unions and allow them to grow in a fashion that gives confidence to their members and those who have dealings with them.

I had not realised the extent to which I was connected with it.  My father was actively involved in the first two credit unions in Dublin.  I looked up the Internet today and discovered that he was actively involved in 1955, 1956 and 1957 when the D\u00fan Laoghaire credit union co-operative was established.  I believe the Donore Credit Union was the first of its kind set up in Dublin.  If I remember correctly there was one in Castleblayney or somewhere in County Monaghan as well.  I grew up in a house where people were actively involved in the credit union co-operative movement.  People such as Nora Herlihy, Seamus Mac Eoin and Brendan O'Cearbhuill were the founders in those days and they went on to establish something that has been worthy of support over the years.<\/p><p>I like to think that the steps we are taking today will enhance and build on the reputation of the credit union movement.  While I welcome the updating of legislation on credit unions, we must at all costs avoid tarring credit unions with the same brush with which we have tarred the banks.  It is fair to say that the banks deserve it.  We all agree.<\/p><p>As someone who has lived through four or five recessions and done business in tough times during those years I am fully aware of how credit unions have provided a lifeline to many businesses and individuals.  On occasion, banks simply would not lend unless they were given full security.  Thus, credit unions were established for the people.  We are getting to the point again where it is remarkably difficult for individuals and SMEs in particular to get loans from banks.  This is where credit unions come in.  In the nine months from October 2011 to June 2012 they provided \u20ac1.1 billion in loans to the membership.  People would be a great deal worse off without this vital facility.<\/p><p>There is a great worldwide movement back to credit unions and what is termed community banking.  Bill Clinton made an interesting comment recently.  He remarked on how this was the way forward.  When asked about the Occupy Wall Street movement call to shift billions of dollars from banks to smaller credit unions he said he believed it was a good thing.  I do not think many people would necessarily agree with that, especially because the larger banks are reluctant to loan now.  He suggested that one simple thing people could do was to put their money in a community bank sensitive to their needs.  Such community banking is common in certain countries, including Germany.  An SME funding bank was set up recently in France.  Germany has two such banks while community banks in America lend to local communities.  These banks are vital.  We need to consider ways to attract or establish such banks in Ireland to complement our credit unions.  This is something we should be able to achieve and such developments are important to consider.<\/p><p>During the boom the banks lost a great deal of their ability to know their customers.  Has the Minister of State heard of a new bank that could be attractive option?<\/p> <p>I have in mind a bank in Britain although I cannot remember the name of it.  The head of the bank said: \"We have chosen to operate through brokers rather than a branch network which makes us efficient and agile, and we make fast, robust decisions based on common sense and knowledge of our customers \u2014 not a computer score.\"  I admire this thinking because it harks back to when the banks knew their customers.  Such co-operative banks pride themselves on this philosophy.<\/p><p>The Irish League of Credit Unions argues that credit unions should be leaders in assisting the Government in implementing its financial inclusion agenda.  It maintains that this could be realised through the Bill.  The legislation should encourage credit unions by permitting them to offer electronic payment accounts.  This is a sensible idea to make it easier for the customer to do business and I believe the relevant provision should be included in the Bill.  I offer an example of how this could be good for business in Ireland.  In the United Kingdom the &quot;one in, one out&quot; system requires Government departments there to assess the net cost to business of complying with any new regulation proposed.  This is an &quot;in&quot;.  Each time this is assessed, calculations are validated by the independent regulatory committee.  If a new regulation means a cost to business, a deregulatory measure or &quot;out&quot; must be found to reduce the cost.  If we are to succeed in making the Credit Union Bill do exactly what we want it to do we must ensure any steps we take enable the credit unions to have the freedom which they had in the past.  We should not tie them down with more regulations, although we must ensure that some of the faults that occurred in the past do not recur in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400029#CC00400","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354641900,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Senator John Kelly is next.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Prior to Senator Quinn speaking on the credit union movement, no Member had expressed any involvement in it.  I am pleased to say that I was a founder member of the credit union in Castlerea, County Roscommon, in the late 1980s.  I know what is involved in setting up such a body and the hours, days and years it took to establish it.  I was a director for ten years and a teller for ten years.  If I am complimentary of the credit union movement, the House will fully understand why because I see the great work it does.<\/p><p>As Senator Quinn noted, it is important that we do not tar the credit union movement with the same brush that the banking sector, rightly, should be tarred with.<\/p><p>The Irish League of Credit Unions has campaigned for radical reform in this area and it is broadly positive about the majority of the provisions.  However, some elements of the Bill were not considered by the commission.  There are requirements under financial services legislation which have not been detailed in the Bill or which are referred to but not in a specific way.  It is something of a catch-all scenario.  We need clarity in the Final Stages of the Bill with regard to this issue.<\/p><p>The issue of term limits has been raised.  I have some experience in this area, purely from my participation in anything related to volunteerism.  I know that most of the original directors of the Castlerea Credit Union, of which I was a founder member, are still directors today.  This is not because they want to be, it is because it is not possible to get volunteers to do anything now.  It is important that any prospective volunteers for the role of director of a credit union should be tellers first in order that they know what they are doing and what the job is about.  It is not as simple as recruiting.  In recent years some members of the same credit union have passed away and it has been difficult to recruit volunteers as directors.  I am unsure about the associated provision in the Bill.  I suggest that in the case of the credit union I have referred to, if people have been directors for the past 25 years they should be left on the board and perhaps the new provisions should apply to new members.<\/p><p>It is important that credit unions are given a chance to provide enhanced services to members and so on.<\/p> <p>The proposal regarding the provision of social finance for Government guaranteed schemes is an excellent one.  I know that there are other organisations that can do something similar, but if there are local projects which are Government-backed, local credit unions should be allowed to play a role in them.  <\/p><p>In the context of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011, I hope the Central Bank will not come down too heavily on credit unions because it is important that we do not take away the flexibility in the sector.  I am also concerned that credit unions will not be forced to pay the price for what the banks did to the economy.  Credit unions play an important role in local communities and legislation should not take away from the ethos of the credit union movement.  <\/p><p>I have raised the matter of guaranteeing loans on numerous occasions in this House and not many of my colleagues believed me when I said what I said.  Many of them had never heard it said before and checked to see if I was correct in my assertion.  If one guarantees a loan for someone else, one hopes and prays that the loan will be repaid.  If it is repaid after a year or so, one blesses oneself and breathes a sigh of relief at being let off the hook.  However, one will not be off the hook unless one ensures one's name is removed from the guarantee.  When one signs a guarantee, one is not just guaranteeing the particular loan but also guaranteeing the person who took it out for life.  It is not a simple process to withdraw from a guarantee.  One must obtain the bank's permission to have one's name withdrawn.  It is very important that people are made aware of this because many individuals have been caught out.  As we can see from the way the banks are conducting their business, they will take any scalp they can get.  If a guarantee was given and is still in a bank's files and the guarantor is still alive, he or she should withdraw his or her lest he or she is made liable for future borrowings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400030#DD00300","speaker":"1161","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354642200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and his assertion that the Seanad will play a crucial role in the making of amendments to the Bill.  I assure him of Sinn F\u00e9in's full and positive input during all Stages in the Seanad.  This is a very important Bill that we need to get right, which is why it is so important that we examine amendments thoroughly.<\/p><p>As other Members have said, the credit union movement is critical in Irish society and has been a very practical and reliable friend to Irish families for decades.   I received my first loan from my local credit union when I was 17 years old.  I also received a loan every year when I was in college and can say the credit union actually put me through college.  I had better tell my mother what Senator John Kelly has just said about guarantors, lest I am tempted to go wild in Las Vegas and leave her to pick up the bill.<\/p><p>In approaching the Bill we must constantly remind ourselves that is not just further legislation to regulate profit-hungry and risk-taking private credit institutions.  As Members have said - the point should be reinforced - the credit union movement is a unique institution which is central to Irish communities, coming from the meitheal system, an approach we have seen so often in communities.  The ethos of, and respect for, the credit union movement stand in direct contrast to the discredited and rightly vilified politicians and wide-boy bankers who brought the country to its knees.  Having said that, reform of the credit union sector is needed.  Sinn F\u00e9in is clear about this and will be supporting the thrust of the Bill.  Obviously, we have some concerns about certain aspects of it and will be tabling amendments to it.  The Minister of State also referred to amendments.<\/p><p>We are where we are after a long period of consultation following publication of the report of the Commission on Credit Unions.  It is now up to us, as legislators, to make sure a fair reformed regime is put in place.  I remind Senators, following earlier comments, that the credit unions will be levied to the tune of \u20ac500 million and are not getting away with anything.  The Minister and his Department have done a good job on the big picture details and I am happy to give credit where credit is due.  The tone struck on probity, restructuring and stabilisation is sensible and worthy of the support of all Senators.<\/p> <p>There are some areas of concern that we believe can be ironed out through the Minister amending the legislation or accepting some of the amendments we will be putting forward.  The first issue of concern is the confusion around the definition of financial services legislation, which is a core issue.  Failure to deal adequately with it will be to the detriment of all concerned.  As I stated earlier, it is all well and good for us to praise the uniqueness of credit unions, but if we fail to address this important question we risk their being lumped together with other credit institutions.  Members of my party met with the Department on this issue.  While it was stressed that only those portions of the legislation which already applied to credit unions would be covered by this definition, we remain concerned about leaving this open to discussion.  The Minister of State stated in his speech that it should be possible to add some nuances to the definition to clarify it.  I would welcome if he could elaborate in his summation on how it is proposed to do this.<\/p><p>The second issue of concern is that of term limits in respect of membership of the board of directors.  We can talk all we like about the uniqueness of the credit union movement and the volunteer ethic behind it, but these are but words if we do not recognise this in the Bill.  I know the Minister of State will have already heard the arguments in this regard.  However, I implore him once again to rethink this provision.  As Senator Kelly has already raised the issue, I will not go into too much detail on it now.  We need to ensure the commission's recommendations in regard to allowing credit unions to offer electronically enabled payments to facilitate the sharing of services between credit unions are taken into account.  This needs to be explicitly permitted for member-level shared services.  The Minister of State mentioned in his speech that the Minister had reiterated the Government's position in support of this and that a report and recommendation on how to proceed has been requested from the Credit Union Advisory Committee.  I would welcome if the Minister of State could elaborate on the timeframe in that regard, how that will feed into this legislation and what the credit union movement is seeking.  In this day and age, it is a matter of common sense that member-level sharing, such as is being sought by the credit union movement, is explicitly included in the Bill.<\/p><p>I call on the Minister of State and my fellow Senators to consider the inclusion of a memorandum of understanding in respect of the relationship between credit unions and the registrar of credit unions, which has been an uneasy one.  I do not propose that the detail of the memorandum of understanding be inserted into the legislation.  It could be thrashed out by the Central Bank in consultation with the implementation group.  Sinn F\u00e9in supports this legislation and urges the Minister to strengthen it to ensure it is good legislation.  We are all united in our support for further regulation reform.  It is hoped that on Committee Stage we will hammer out the last few chinks in the legislation.  I look forward to Committee Stage, where we can discuss these issues further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400031#EE00200","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354642800,"counter":192,"content":"<p>While the credit unions are deserving of all the plaudits and pl\u00e1m\u00e1s they are getting today, what they really need is protection from the Central Bank and Mr. Matthew Elderfield, whose reputation precedes him.  Having made inquires, I am aware of what happened under his watch to the credit union movement in another jurisdiction.  <\/p><p>  The Minister of State stated in his speech:<blockquote>The report is focused on what is needed for the credit union system.  It does not apply banking thinking; nor does it slavishly import models from other international credit union movements.  <\/blockquote>It is ironic that this is included in the Minister of State's speech.<\/p><p>  On stabilisation, while the Government is making &#8364;500 million available, all of this money will be repaid through a levy.  There is no bailout.  All of this money will be repaid.  Let us not get carried away.  Ordinary members of credit unions will pay for this facility.  The Minister of State mentioned that the credit union movement is not a banking system.  While the title of this Bill is the Credit Union Bill 2012, the Central Bank is mentioned in it more times than is the credit union movement.  On shared services, not every Garda station in the country has a breathalyser device, which is used to test the alcohol levels of a person suspected of drink driving.  Shared services, in terms of their structure, will result in the demise of smaller credit unions.  If I choose to have my single farm payment cheque paid into my credit union account I want it done by way of electronic transfer.  If this facility is available in my town and not in my local credit union, it is obvious which one I will go to.  Shared services must be as customer-friendly as possible.<\/p><p>  As I understand it, the credit union movement currently has savings of &#8364;7 billion which it cannot lend.  Only 25% of this money can be held by any one institution.  There are only two pillar banks in this country, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.  This means the remaining 50% of credit union funds is invested in foreign banks.  Perhaps the Government would consider establishing a bond of, say, &#8364;5 billion or &#8364;7 billion - there is still time to do so in this Bill - in which the credit union movement can invest, the return on which can be used by the Government for job creation and capital projects in this country.  This would be a better use of credit union funds and would benefit every community in the country.<\/p><p>  Section 29 provides that before introducing regulations - this relates back to banking-type thinking and the Central Bank and Mr. Elderfield - the Central Bank will be required to consult with the Minister for Finance, the Credit Union Advisory Committee and other credit union bodies.  Although this is not specifically required in legislation, this consultation is to be done in accordance with a consultation protocol which has been published by the Central Bank.  I will leave it at that until Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400032#FF00200","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1354642800,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on this important Bill.  It is legislation that must be welcomed in the general context.<\/p><p>Before I comment on the Bill, I want to acknowledge the tremendous work being done by the credit union movement throughout the country, including the staff and volunteers who work in the sector.  If one asks any individual living in a particular town where there is a credit union who is lending in the area, they will say the credit union, whether it is a loan to go to Las Vegas, buy a car, fund a child going to college or help support a small business.  For this reason, credit unions must be supported.  Any legislation that protects the credit union movement must be supported.  Fianna F\u00e1il supports the Bill, to which it tabled a number of amendments during its passage through the D\u00e1il.  The Minister has given assurances in relation to some of those amendments.  We await the tabling of Government amendments in the Seanad as promised in the D\u00e1il, which it is hoped will alleviate the concerns expressed by the Irish League of Credit Unions.<\/p> <p>In Ireland there is a 67% level of penetration in terms of credit union accounts among the population.  In other words, 2.9 million citizens have an account in one of the 403 credit unions throughout the country, a staggeringly high proportion of the population.  This shows the confidence the general public has in the credit union movement.  It offers a grassroots approach to the ordinary member who can go to the annual general meeting and play an active role within his or her local credit union, and this must be supported by all political parties.  I believe this legislation will go a long way in supporting the credit union movement.<\/p><p>The Minister of State will be aware we have had meetings with the ILCU, which has discussed the Bill with local branches.  As Senator Kelly noted, they have expressed concerns about some of the Bill's proposals, and also the specific proposals made by the commission that were not included in the legislation, such as those pertaining to the term over which a member can sit on the board of a credit union.  The Minister indicated in the D\u00e1il that he might increase the period from nine to 12 years.  I hope that can be done as it may go some distance towards supporting the views of the ILCU.<\/p><p>I refer to restructuring and rationalisation.  I do not wish to speak at length because we will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to have much more discussion on the Bill.  Rationalisation of credit unions is not new; it has happened throughout the world.  I fully appreciate there are credit unions that may not be economically viable or are under financial pressure in certain areas.  There was a case in Newbridge in County Kildare earlier this year in which there were major difficulties.  The Bill is trying to protect such credit unions.  By way of comparison, currently there are credit unions in local areas where banks are closing branches.  In my home town there are branches of the AIB and Bank of Ireland but AIB is closing and Bank of Ireland operates only a three-day week.  The Minister referred to this issue in his speech.  We should give credit unions much more autonomy.  Let us allow them to have the hole-in-the-wall facility and have salaries paid into accounts.  That option is contained in the legislation and should be fully supported and rolled out as quickly as possible.  It would increase the viability of credit unions and would also help the general public.<\/p><p>The number of credit unions in Britain fell by 70% when new regulations were introduced.  Australia had 700 credit unions but after new regulations the number fell to 106.  There is a worry - I certainly worry - that if the regulations are too stringent we might end up with a reduced number of credit unions in the country.  It is important that this does not happen and that we support the existing credit unions nationwide so we do not end up with a situation similar to that in Australia or Britain.  I hope the Minister will bear that in mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400032#FF00300","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354643400,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss what is obviously an important matter.  This Bill is important legislation which will shape the future structure of the credit union movement that we all hold dear and are involved with in one way or another.  That is why it is imperative to do the movement justice.  We must ensure we take its views into account.  In this context, the correspondence from the ILCU has been helpful in relaying the views of the wider membership of the movement.  I am sure Members have studied it.  I am aware the Minister promised to introduce amendments in this House upon the conclusion of work by the finance committee, although unfortunately I missed that work.  Our contributions will therefore be ever more important.  It is our duty to ensure we strike the right balance in this legislation and deliver a robust regulatory regime that allows the credit union movement to maintain its ethos and viability into the future.<\/p><p>Nobody can deny the major role credit unions have played in Irish society over the past 50 years.  Credit unions play an active role in their communities and provide services to members that may have been denied by other more mainstream commercial financial institutions.  It is the close knowledge of the volunteers that makes this possible.  This element of the relationship is very important and allows for a sustainable lending model in which small loans are advanced.  It has been stated by other Members of the Oireachtas that these small loans are the lifeblood of many families, especially in these recessionary times and in view of the current difficulties.  However, the credit union movement has not been unaffected by the economic crisis and it is our duty to ensure the protection and future of the movement.<\/p><p>The ILCU was an active member of the Commission on Credit Unions.  I am aware there were contrary views on offer but we must understand that the league must cater for the views of the wider membership.  Furthermore, I understand there are some new elements in the Bill which were not considered by the commission.  We must examine these closely.  It was also brought to my attention that some of the issues considered by the commission are not reflected in the Bill.  A number of sections appear to impose a new general obligation on credit unions to comply with unspecified financial services legislation.  This was a matter discussed on Committee Stage in the D\u00e1il and again I emphasise the importance of clarifying for the credit union movement which aspects of the financial services legislation will apply because a blanket imposition of legislation in this regard could be particularly burdensome for the movement.  The Minister of State might outline to the House what legislation will apply, and it would be helpful if he were to state whether he intends to clarify this in the legislation.<\/p><p>We all know the credit union movement has an active role to play in the community, not only in providing financial services for members of that community but also in the significant contribution its members and volunteers provide to the administration of the credit union.  One cannot state enough the important resource the credit unions have in their volunteers, particularly the smaller credit unions.  Prohibitions and term limits on membership of credit union boards of directors were proposed by the commission, but it is felt by many in the movement that such provisions are too restrictive and represent a direct attack on volunteer participation on credit union boards.  The aim may be to allow for renewal of the credit union boards, but the participation and involvement of volunteers, on which many credit unions rely so heavily, would be significantly undermined.  The whole ethos of credit unions in this State, so distinct from that of other financial institutions, may be compromised.  It could be said that on the one hand there is an impetus to align credit unions more closely with other financial bodies such as banks by imposing the type of governance restrictions contained in the Bill, while on the other hand, provisions for a more modernised service for members which could allow the credit unions to continue to compete alongside banks and allow for the modernisation of credit unions are glaringly absent from the Bill.  These matters were discussed by the commission but have not been included in the Bill.  Credit unions should be able to offer electronically enabled payment accounts.  There are also opportunities for the sharing of member services between credit unions, which could significantly enhance services to members. <\/p><p>A number of Members in the adjoining House have raised the issue of the ability of credit unions to invest in Government-backed schemes.  I raise an issue that should be explored in the legislation, which was raised by the movement, namely, the ability to raise additional capital.  This is especially relevant against the backdrop of a restructuring of the movement and in the context of a sustained reduction in income.

It is good to see him here again.  I thank him for taking on board many of the concerns that have been raised by the credit unions.<\/p><p>Credit unions have already highlighted the difficulties they are experiencing in the context of recruiting new directors and volunteers.  Many credit union officers have been in their positions for some time.  As a result of the timeframe which applies to their periods of service, large numbers of them may be obliged to retire at the same time.  I am aware that the Minister for Finance has given consideration to increasing the time limit from nine to 12 years.  Perhaps it might be possible to put in place a transition period during which outgoing board members might work with those who are going to replace them.  This would mean that the latter would obtain the skills that will be necessary to allow them to run credit unions in the future.<\/p><p>The ethos of the credit union movement is local in nature.  It aims to highlight volunteerism and the willingness of people to be involved with the local credit unions.  This is an important factor in all  communities.  The local knowledge and expertise of officers has led to a large number of credit unions being in a healthy financial position.  We should ensure that such knowledge and expertise is retained.  Most Senators have worked with their local credit unions and are members of them.  We usually visit our credit unions late in the evening and we see the range of different people who avail of the services on offer.

Credit unions are an example of the very best of the co-operative movement.  Every small town in the country has a credit union which has served the needs of the local community very well.<\/p><p>Credit unions have always been regarded as the small person's bank.  Credit unions provided lifelines to people who did not have many resources and who would have been overawed at the prospect of meeting a bank manager when times were difficult.  Many small businesses in the town in which I live, Ballinasloe, and in the surrounding area began operating and have survived as a result of assistance provided by local credit unions.  Like other Senators, I want the credit union to be strengthened.  I appreciate the support which credit unions have provided within communities and in respect of particular projects.  In Ballinasloe there is a community facility whereby small businesses can start up operations.  The local credit union was one of the main sources of funding for the project in question, Ballinasloe Area Community Development Limited, which has been responsible for the creation of 180 jobs.  This has been made possible by the efforts of the local chamber of commerce, the town council and the credit union.<\/p><p>Reference was made to volunteerism.  The strength of the credit union movement over the years has been a result of the dedication and commitment of its volunteers, who have given unselfishly of their time and expertise.  There is a need to be flexible and I welcome the fact that the Minister of State indicated a willingness to examine the provision relating to length of a time a person can serve on the board of a credit union and, perhaps, to making some amendments on Committee Stage in this regard.<\/p><p>The credit union in Ballinasloe raised two issues with me.  The first of these - I am sure previous speakers referred to it - is that which relates to shared services.  This obviously involves the inability of a credit union to service its members other than at its own office.  As such, the Irish League of Credit Unions was looking to the Bill in the context of it enabling credit union members to have access to their accounts at any credit union office throughout the country.  Members are facilitated in accessing their accounts by electronic means and they do so a regular basis.  However, physically accessing one's account at another credit union office remains a problem.  This is because each credit union is obliged by law to serve only its members and no one else.  The Irish League of Credit Unions is seeking to enable credit union members to access their accounts wherever they wish.  This is a sensible and practical suggestion and I urge the Minister of State to consider it.<\/p><p>The second issue that was raised with me relates to the memorandum of understanding, which will give the credit unions and the Registry of Credit Unions a clear comprehension of how they should interact with each other.  It will also indicate the level of service each expects of the other.  In the D\u00e1il the Minister for Finance indicated that the registry had issued a consultation protocol for credit unions.  This protocol will allow for structured engagement with credit unions in order to seek, receive, analyse and respond to feedback received, build consensus on new regulations and to inform the decision-making process.  However, it does not contain any indication as to the type of service a credit union may, on an individual basis, expect to receive from the registry.  During the past two to three years the latter has prohibited some credit unions from holding AGMs.  Under the Credit Union Act 1997, AGMs are supposed to take place within four months of year end.  The registry can, by law, delay an AGM for nine months.  The 1997 Act is silent with regard to what happens thereafter.  Credit unions have been unable to have this matter addressed.  The Irish League of Credit Unions believes that a memorandum of understanding between credit unions and their regulator would be beneficial to all concerned.  In addition, it would oblige both parties to behave responsibly.<\/p><p>We have made significant progress.  I hope the Minister for Finance, as he indicated in the D\u00e1il, will take on board some of the issues raised by Members and by the Irish League of Credit Unions.  I would like a structure to be put in place that will guarantee the future success and viability of credit unions in order that they might continue to provide people and communities with the type of service they have both enjoyed and come to expect.  There is huge support for the credit union movement.  I want that movement to be strengthened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400034#HH00200","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1354644000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their contributions to the Second Stage debate on this very important legislation.  I reassure colleagues that the Government has a very open mind and is taking a constructive approach to progressing the legislation in such a way that we will put in place the best possible framework for the credit union movement.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn made an extremely striking point when he stated that one of the outcomes of the financial crisis will inevitably be that people will view banking, saving and prudential risk in a different way than they might have done ten years ago.  I agree with the Senator in this regard.  The credit union movement which, in view of the enormous losses that have taken place in the banking sector, is coming through the crisis relatively unscathed.  There will, as a result, be enormous opportunities for credit unions to exploit in the future, particularly when people reconsider the their banking requirements and those of their communities.  I am aware of the comments made by the former US President, Mr. Bill Clinton, when commenting on the opportunities that exist in the context of community banking.  There is a need for a new ethos and such an ethos has always been articulated by the credit union movement.  I am interested, for example, in the Islamic financing model, which looks at the question of prudential risk in a completely different way.  Investment in public infrastructure is a key element of this model.  We must always be prepared to learn from other such models.  The community banking model - in this country we refer to it as the credit union model - will provide an opportunity to place the credit union movement on a more firm footing in the coming years and it will also allow people to make different decisions in respect of their finances.<\/p><p>I wish to recognise the role played in this area by a very distinguished former Senator, Mr. Joe O'Toole, who was a member of the original commission and who is currently a member of ReBo.<\/p> <p>He and the other members of the commission played a crucial role by working on the 60 or so original recommendations to ensure they were fit for purpose and reflect the mainstream view of credit unions.  The credit union movement is not just one homogeneous group but reflects the community with big and small credit unions in urban and rural Ireland.  We are trying to reflect all of that in legislation on the financial requirements in the years ahead.<\/p><p>The criteria we used are based on three pillars.  We must respect the mandate of the credit union movement, which is a not for profit organisation.  That is individual and unique and accounts for the success of the movement.  As Senators said in the course of their contributions, we must recognise the volunteer ethos, which is at the heart of the Irish credit union movement.  The point forcefully put by many Senators is that we do not want to see unintended consequences as a result of the legislation.  Senator \u00d3 Domhnaill made the point on the impact such legislation had in Australia.  We need to learn from that experience.  We must ensure that at the heart of this legislation is respect and understanding for the volunteer ethos.  The third pillar on which the legislation is built is the community focus.  Local knowledge is the one difference between the credit union movement and the banks.  As I have said repeatedly, the banks should get to know and understand their customer base and know their requirements.  They need to get into the heart of the community again and do the things that bank managers did 30 years ago and understand the risk.  That knowledge is already there in the credit union movement.  The community focus ensures the knowledge transfer, which is really important if the credit union movement is to go forward.<\/p><p>I congratulate and thank the commission for their work.  They were open and inclusive and attempted to bring together the various strands of the credit union movement and produce a report that is capable of being implemented.  The Bill delivers on the 60 recommendations of the commission on the credit unions.  It clearly demonstrates the Government's commitment to the early implementation of this report.  There is no point in having recommendations and not following up on them.  The legislation before the House reflects the consensus majority view expressed in the recommendations.<\/p><p>I will now deal with the issues raised by Members.  Senator Gilroy referred to section 10 and the reference to lending to a credit union being unenforceable if it is in breach of limits.  There is nothing new in this.  This was in the 1997 legislation on credit unions.  My understanding is that the Credit Union Act 1997 places the onus on the third party entity lending money to the credit union.  The onus is on the third party entity to ensure that it is not lending to credit unions above and beyond the limits that have already been set by the Central Bank.  That is a measure to protect credit unions and to ensure that the onus is on the entity lending them the money not to do something over and above the limits that have already been set by the Central Bank.  That is a prudential provision in the 1997 legislation and is simply reinforced in section 10.  Senator Gilroy referred also to the definition of shares.  Shares in a credit union do not compute to the definition of a share in a company or limited company.  Every single euro that a member has on deposit in a credit union is equivalent to a share.  Shares in the credit union refer to savings and depositors.  It is not like having shares in a company.<\/p><p>Senator Reilly raised the question of shared branching.  This came up on both Committee and Report Stages in the D\u00e1il.  A report on shared branching is being prepared by the credit union advisory committee and the Minister, Deputy Noonan informed the lower House that by the end of the second quarter of next year he expects to be in possession of that report.  He is open to the idea but his view is that it is probably premature to legislate for it in the current Bill.  If new legislation is required, he will consider it.  He cannot do this outside of the commission recommendations and that is the reason for a specific piece of work to be done.  The matter is being followed up.  We will see the outcome of that report.  It was not dealt with in the commission report.  We must ask why and whether it was regarded as a major issue by the Irish League of Credit Unions and the credit unions generally.  We will be in a better position by the middle of next year to come to a view on shared branching.  I thank Senator Reilly for raising it.<\/p><p>Senator Sheahan asked for a number of amendments to be considered on the question of public investment projects.  He will be glad to learn that we will bring forward an amendment capturing what is a public investment project and the Minister gave an assurance that he will bring in such an amendment on Committee Stage.  There was very detailed discussion on this.  It would be a good thing to encourage credit unions to invest in public infrastructure projects, where it yields a public good from it.  We will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to reflect that.<\/p><p>He also raised the bond issue.  The Minister is open to considering this, however this was not a major issue of concern among the credit unions when engaging with the commission.  We need greater clarity from the credit unions about how that would work, but the Minister is open to the issue if a consensus view were to emerge.  It has not been raised.  I know it was raised in this House by Deputy Sheahan and in the D\u00e1il by colleagues, but it has not come up as a major issue of concern among credit union members.  The Minister has no difficulty looking at it if there is broad support for it.<\/p><p>At the start I was asked to set out the areas in which we propose to table Committee Stage amendments.  The first is a change in the definition of financial service legislation for clarification purposes.  Many Senators raised this question.  We are exploring with the Attorney General as to how to provide a better definition.  A credit union is a credit union and is not a bank and it should not be outside the scope of the Parliamentary Counsel to reflect that in the definition.  It must also be said that credit unions themselves have managed outside that definition to obtain new functions in the past decade and a half in areas, which one would regard as exclusively in the financial services area.  Credit unions have become insurance mediators and provide products through insurance.  Credit union have involved themselves in the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995.  Credit unions have an application in terms of the European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009, which is the deposit guarantee scheme.  Defining their role in such exacting terms as to exclude them from things they want to do would not be in their interest.  <\/p> <p>We are working with the Attorney General to provide a better definition for credit unions.  This was a view expressed by all Senators.  The second area in which we intend to bring forward amendments includes the question of changes to the exclusions from the board of oversight committee.  The Minister for Finance has heard the views of colleagues and will bring forward amendments to reflect the majority view.  <\/p><p>The third area covers the extension of term limits from nine years to 12 years out of 15, an issue raised by many Senators.  The Minister stated in the other House that he would bring forward an amendment in that regard.  <\/p><p>The fourth area includes the specific reference to investment in Government supported projects.  I referred to this issue in reply to Senator Tom Sheahan.<\/p><p>The fifth area is ReBo running costs which are to be funded from the credit union fund rather than the Exchequer.  Credit unions will obtain the benefit of this restructuring.  ReBo is the overarching body which will be staffed by good people with a knowledge of the credit union movement.  The provision of a levy is not a new idea and I take the Senator's point that the credit unions are paying for this.  The \u20ac500 million is not an open-ended loan and the money will come back.  It is not like the \u20ac64 billion we have had to put into the banks, although it is the Government's mission to get some of this money back at some point in the future.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander and the Senator's observation is fair.<\/p><p>Senator Thomas Byrne asked why we were bringing forward changes on Committee Stage in respect of the IOSCO, the International Organisation of Securities Commission, - the memorandum to which I referred - to allow the Central Bank to sign an international co-operation agreement.  This is an urgent matter and the detail will be dealt with on Committee Stage.  We are using this opportunity to allow the House to give its views before the end of the year.<\/p><p>The issue of shared services was raised with reference to the role of the new restructuring board, ReBo.  This is a small country, but the credit union movement is a varied sector owing to its size and nature.  Costs can be cut by the use of shared services and if expertise is shared regionally and nationally.  The new credit union movement will have many credit unions attached as spokes in a national movement.  They can learn from each other and share services between them.  This is essential, both for the Government which has to restructure and share HR and financial services and also for the proper functioning of the credit union movement.  We cannot allow this to be used as an excuse for allowing small credit unions to fall off the face of the earth.  There should not be unintended consequences as a result of this legislation.  The Bill should not provide means by which smaller credit unions would find that they no longer had a mandate.  We have to be careful to ensure this will not happen.  The credit union restructuring board has been established with Mr. McVeigh as a very experienced chairman.  Former Senator Joe O'Toole and others are on the board.  This will help the restructuring plan such that the future viability of credit unions will not be in doubt and in order that people will have absolute confidence in their ability to continue their good work in the community.<\/p><p>I look forward to working with Senators next week, although I do not mean to presume that is when the House will decide to deal with Committee Stage.  However, I assure Senators of the good intent of the Government to ensure we will have robust legislation to provide for the best possible standards for the credit union movement.  I hope the Bill will be regarded as another essential development in the credit union movement which has done such good work in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400034#HH00300","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354645200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1354645200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400036#KK00300","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1354645200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400036#KK00400","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354645200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 11 December 2012.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354645200,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.45 p.m. and resumed at 6 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Personal Insolvency Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)","time":1354645500,"counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400037#LL00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1354645500,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister back to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400037#LL00200","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354645500,"counter":210,"content":"<p>SECTION 25<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354645500,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 34:\r\nIn page 30, subsection (1), lines 15 to 17, to delete paragraph (a) and substitute the following:&quot;(a) such information as may be prescribed in relation to--\r\n(i)  his or her creditors,\r\n(ii) his or her debts and other liabilities,\r\n(iii) his or her assets, and\r\n(iv) the efforts made by him or her to reach an alternative repayment arrangement with his or her creditors, and&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1354645500,"counter":212,"content":"<p>This amendment proposes to set out more clearly the information the debtor is required to provide for the approved intermediary in support of his or her application for a debt relief notice.

This may not be of major importance in the context of a debt relief notice which, if it comes to dealing with banks, will perhaps apply to small amounts of credit card debt as opposed to major debt, but it is of the utmost importance that banks have proper procedures in place and that they properly respond to individuals.

The reason I tabled the amendment is an article about the Bill in the <i>Sunday Business Post<\/i> on 7 October by Eoin Collins in which he stated:<blockquote>One overlooked possible improvement in the legislation would have been to guarantee the right to operate a bank account.  Surprisingly, this is still a difficulty for many undischarged bankrupts in the Republic unlike in Britain and the North.  Life without a bank account in the modern world goes beyond a mere inconvenience and one wonders at the public policy logic for compelling people known to be in financial difficulty to operate on a cash only basis.<\/blockquote>I am not sure why there is an insistence on that but it would be a logical improvement to the legislation if we were able to protect somebody with a guarantee of a bank account.  Operating on cash-only basis is not possible in the modern world.  I do not know how anyone would feed his or her family on such a basis.  Having been in the grocery business, I am aware that few cheques are used nowadays and in future the likely use of identification will be on an optical or fingerprint basis, rather than through credit or debit cards.  If there is a difficulty with having a bank account, it makes it almost impossible to feed a family.  I am not sure whether the wording I have used is correct but, based on the newspaper article, there is a difficulty here compared with the North.  The legislation should enable somebody to at least have the right to open a bank account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400039#NN00400","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1354646700,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I am generally in agreement with the sentiments expressed in the amendment.  However, the Bankruptcy Act 1988 contains no prohibition on the holding of a bank account by a bankrupt, although many people believe it does.  An individual's affairs are currently subject to scrutiny by the official assignee in bankruptcy and, in practice, financial institutions have not been enthusiastic to allow individuals in bankruptcy to open a new account for obvious reasons.  I am exploring with the offices of the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel whether I can impose what could be described as a positive right to open or continue to operate a bank account on financial institutions.  If possible, I will bring forward a suitable Report Stage amendment.<\/p><p>The amendment makes reference to an individual debtor being guaranteed the right &quot;to open and operate any bank account...provided by a banking institution&quot;.  In circumstances where an individual is insolvent, a DSA or a PIA will be in place and it is envisaged that, over a period of years, various payments will be made to creditors.  Under a PIA, mortgage repayments will be made to financial institutions while unsecured debt due to such institutions will be paid under a DSA.  Clearly, it will suit the debtor and creditors, in particular, financial institutions to have money going into a bank account which is used to distribute payments.  The notion that individuals may be forced to wander around handing out wads of cash in this day and age is bizarre.<\/p><p>However, there are a number of problems with the amendment.  No financial institution is compelled to allow any individual, solvent or insolvent, to open an account.  If there is a right to open an account, where will it be exercised?  Will it be imposed on, for example, Bank of Ireland or AIB or will every financial institution be under an obligation to allow an individual to open at least one account where he or she can establish he or she has no current functioning accounts?  What will be the nature of the account?  If there was to be an account for an individual who is insolvent and a party to one of the new settlement arrangements, it would have to be what the Americans call a debit account.  Our banks are suddenly recognising customers should have debit cards rather than Laser or credit cards.  Up until recently, most people used Laser cards to get cash and credit cards but in the US, for many years, individuals have had access to bank accounts with no overdraft facility on which they have a debit card to make payments.  That is the ideal account for an insolvent individual to ensure he or she does not again overreach and spend money he or she does not have.<\/p><p>There is merit in the amendment but it does not work as drafted because it is open to the suggestion that banks could be compelled to allow people to run current accounts with overdrafts at unspecified interest rates but we are in consultation with the Attorney General about this.  There is a practical and reasonable need for individuals to have access to a debit account with no overdraft facility, which would facilitate both the making and receipt of payments, and I hope we can return to that issue on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400039#NN00500","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1354646700,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's sympathy with the issue raised.

However, it appears as if that is part of the problem because it would be strange, as the Minster said, to allow somebody to open a bank account with extensive credit facilities.  I had not thought about this, until he drew it to the attention of the House, but it would be absurd to privilege debtors over ordinary citizens.  If the amendment were accepted, the Minister would grant automatic rights to a bank account to a debtor, which do not exist for the ordinary citizen.  I do not see any reason for privileging debtors until each citizen has been declared a debtor, in which case there would be inequality.

An existing bank account will either be in the black or the red.  If it is in the black, the money in it comprises part of the overall resources.  Where there is a debt settlement or personal insolvency arrangement, there will be engagement with the personal insolvency practitioner who will make, having obtained a full disclosure, proposals to creditors as to what arrangements might be put in place.  If an account is very much in the black, despite the existence of a range of other debts overshadowing the account, some of the money in it might have to go into the pot to pay the creditors.  Other sums therein may not.  There is nothing in the legislation stipulating the freezing of a bank account, but, clearly, if one's bank account is in the red, one's personal insolvency practitioner will have to notify the financial institution.  I presume that if the financial institution is giving the debtor some leverage to have an overdraft, it will put a stop to the overdraft growing further during the process.  Ultimately, it will be for the financial institution to determine whether the account will continue to be operated; there is nothing in the legislation stating it should not.  I presume financial institutions that want to be paid will see an advantage in maintaining an account if the account holder is in employment and has a salary paid into it.  I presume the financial institutions will want to put a block on an overdraft facility because one could not have somebody in that arrangement building an overdraft and paying the financial obligations that arise pursuant to the arrangement.  There is nothing in the legislation stating a debtor party to a debt settlement or personal insolvency arrangement cannot maintain an account.

The amendment improves the text of the existing section 35 in regard to situations in the debt relief notice process when a possible payment to creditors becomes available.

The word &quot;insolvent&quot; is, of itself, sufficient and there is no need for the extra wording to be added, as proposed by the Senator.  Sections 53 and 88 of the Bill have been drafted so that the eligibility criteria for entering into a debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement are all objective, factual and not based on opinion.  The likelihood that a person would be able to become solvent over the next number of years is, by its nature, opinion based.  We have therefore provided for this in section 50, under which the personal insolvency practitioner makes his or her statement of opinion, including on matters set out in section 50(d).  Section 53 refers to this in subsection (1)<i>(d).  <\/i>In other words, the eligibility criteria under section 53 are that the personal insolvency practitioner has given an opinion under section 50 of the likelihood of the debtor becoming solvent during the next five years.

In such a case, a statutory requirement for a meeting to be called might not be desirable.

process whereby the Insolvency Service refers an application for a protective certificate in respect of a debt settlement arrangement to the court.  The new elements concern situations where the Insolvency Service is dissatisfied with the application and may require a revised application where a court requires further information.  Where a court decides to hold a hearing, it may hold it otherwise than in public.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 56 from Senator O'Brien would add a reference to the debtor being able to object to the court in regard to the issuance of a protective certificate.  There is no need to extend this appeal facility to a debtor as the debtor would not be aggrieved by the issuing of a protective certificate sought on his or her behalf by an insolvency practitioner.  Clearly, the provision of such a certificate is for the benefit of a debtor and there would be no reason for the debtor to want to have the certificate set aside.  Consequently, I do not see how this issue arises.  What is being proposed would make no sense and would only serve to negate efforts to reach a settlement.  Effectively it would mean the debtor applying for the protection afforded to him or her by the court to be removed, which would be a very odd application to make.  The Senator seeks to make a further addition in regard to how the court should make orders, taking into account all the circumstances of the debt.  It is objectionable to suggest that the court would not operate on a just and reasonable basis.  Also, the proposed addition might risk a court rejecting the protective certificate sought for the protection of the debtor and for that reason I am opposed to this amendment.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 96 is similar in purpose to amendment No.55 and proposes the deletion of Section 91 and its substitution with an improved and extended text in regard to the process whereby the Insolvency Service refers an application for a protective certificate in respect of a personal insolvency arrangement to the court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400043#RR01700","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354649100,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354649100,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Section 56 deleted.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354649100,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Section 57 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354649100,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 56 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354649100,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Section 58 agreed to.\r\n  SECTION 59<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1354649100,"counter":352,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 57 and 58 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400043#RR02250","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354649100,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 57:\r\nIn page 56, subsection (2)(a), line 26, to delete &#8220;debts;&#8221; and substitute &#8220;debts.&#8221;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1354649100,"counter":354,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 57 and 58 are technical drafting amendments advised by Parliamentary Counsel to improve the text.<\/p><p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400043#RR02500","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354649100,"counter":355,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 58:\r\nIn page 56, subsection (2)(b)(ii), line 31, to delete &#8220;concerned;&#8221; and substitute &#8220;concerned.&#8221;.\r\n  Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354649100,"counter":356,"content":"<p>Section 59, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354649100,"counter":357,"content":"<p>SECTION 60Government amendment No. 59:In page 57, subsection (2)(b), line 8, to delete &#8220;subject to paragraphs (c) and (d),&#8221;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1354649100,"counter":358,"content":"<p>  Amendment agreed to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400043#RR03100","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354649100,"counter":359,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 60:\r\nIn page 57, subsection (2), lines 13 to 49 and in page 58, lines 1 and 2, to delete paragraphs (c) and (d).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1354649100,"counter":360,"content":"<p>  Amendment agreed to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400043#RR03400","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354649100,"counter":361,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 61:\r\nIn page 59, lines 3 to 10, to delete subsection (4) and substitute the following:\r\n&#8220;(4) For the purposes of subsection (2)(f), and without prejudice to subsection (3), in determining whether a debtor would have sufficient income to maintain a reasonable standard of living for the debtor and his or her dependants under the Debt Settlement Arrangement, regard shall be had to any guidelines issued under section 23.&#8221;.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354649100,"counter":362,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354649100,"counter":363,"content":"<p>Section 60, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354649100,"counter":364,"content":"<p>SECTION 61Government amendment No. 62: In page 59, subsection (3), line 30, to delete &#8220;Arrangement,&#8221; and substitute &#8220;Arrangement, and subject to section 62,&#8221;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1354649100,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 62 is a technical amendment.

Debt settlement arrangements are applied to unsecured debt without any particular limits being set.  To take a simple example, if somebody has a debt of \u20ac30,000 that is not secured - let us assume it is not a mortgage - it can be dealt with pursuant to the debt settlement arrangement.  However, if two people are unemployed, the debt settlement arrangement envisages that they will over a period of time have a financial capacity to discharge their debts, make payments towards discharging the debt or, if the creditors are agreeable, apply an amount of money at a lesser level to pay off the debt over the period of years provided for in the debt settlement arrangement.<\/p><p>If two people suddenly become unemployed the question arises of what other financial resources they possess and how they propose to deal with the debt.  Does the personal insolvency practitioner present to creditors a scheme which would facilitate, over a period of years, that debt being discharged?  To take it at its simplest, if an individual with no assets, income or resources owed \u20ac30,000, a debt settlement arrangement clearly could not be entered into because no arrangement could be made with creditors.  The option for that individual would be bankruptcy.  If the \u20ac30,000 debt was secured on, for example, a family home it would fall into the personal insolvency arrangement category, and the same issue would arise.<\/p><p>If the answer to whether incomes, assets or resources available to facilitate, over a period of time, the debt being discharged is that there is nothing and the proposal is &quot;We have nothing, we are going to pay nothing&quot;, the creditor may do nothing at all if he or she believes the borrower has nothing, and the matter may remain as is for a very long time.  However, if the creditor sued on the debt and the debt was not paid, he or she would be entitled to put the debtor into bankruptcy.  The latter may also petition for bankruptcy to avoid all of that.  It is a question of the person's or, in the case of a joint debt, persons' individual circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400044#SS00500","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354649700,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354649700,"counter":375,"content":"<p>SECTION 62<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1354649700,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 64, 65, 72, 104 and 105 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.

When we combine all these liabilities, the person trying to pay off his insolvency situation is on a marginal tax rate of 76%.  We found that in insolvency cases in Scandinavia, this rate is capped at 65%.  We want to ensure the person continues to work and that he has some reward greater than a mere 24%.  Even the most scarifying headlines in the newspapers do no propose we should take 76% taxes from people, but that is <i>de facto<\/i> what would happen in this case.

In practical terms, this means that if they work harder or work overtime or their business is successful that they retain some additional portion of the moneys they earn.  The proposal put forward by Senators Crown and Barrett seeks to have any variation of repayments in a debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement arising from an increase in the debtors means limited to 65% of that increase.  I have no particular difficulty with the sentiments behind these proposals, but I must remain consistent in my overall approach.<\/p><p>These new debt resolution arrangements are, essentially, a matter of negotiation between debtors and creditors mediated by a personal insolvency practitioner.  The participants are free to come to whatever repayment options best suit all that can be agreed and fulfilled over the period of the arrangement.  I am not sure that such a specific intervention as proposed would be wise in the context of negotiations between debtors and creditors.  The setting of a definitive figure could become an upward target in the context of some arrangements.  I understand the point the Senator is making, but in the context of both debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangements, it is about an agreement being concluded, based on the individual circumstances of the parties, the debtor and the creditors.  If in the context of that arrangement it is anticipated that over the period the arrangements will apply the income of an individual in employment or a self-employed individual will increase, that is clearly to everyone's advantage.<\/p><p>Creditors want people to be incentivised to continue to earn funds that will facilitate debt being discharged.  If they can be incentivised to earn additional money, the creditors have the incentive of being paid a little sooner or of getting a greater share of the cake.  Clearly, nobody will bother to do that if he will not benefit from it.  Therefore, there is an advantage in this being something that is factored into a debt settlement or personal insolvency arrangement, without imposing some sort of structured provision which might or might not work, depending on individual circumstances and which could, in some circumstances, be a  disincentive to an arrangement.  On a practical basis, this amendment would not necessarily be a benefit.  In the circumstances, I ask the Senator to consider withdrawing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400045#TT01400","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1354650300,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

The context of the debt settlement arrangement, where without any notification by the debtor to his or her personal insolvency practitioner a six-month payment default occurs, that arrangement is unlikely to succeed.  It is important to remember that we are seeking to balance the interests of debtors and creditors in the debt resolution process.<\/p> <p>I remain unconvinced that the period stipulated in the section should be extended to six months.  It is likely that substantial arrears accumulating in the context of moneys owed to a variety of individuals was the reason the arrangement was put in place in the first instance.  It would be put in place on the assumption that the debtor was going to meet his or her repayment commitments, as agreed, and would have the capacity to meet them.  It would be unfair on creditors to prolong matters unduly from a three-month to a six-month period in circumstances where it had become obvious the arrangement was simply not working.  I have expressed the view that a three-month period is adequate in this context.  I oppose amendments Nos. 79 to 82, inclusive, on that basis.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 83 to 86, inclusive, are to section 80.  They seek to increase from six to nine months the period for which the debtor must be in default before a debt settlement arrangement can be deemed to have failed and be in need of being terminated.  Amendment No. 129 proposes a corresponding change to personal insolvency arrangements.  I am opposed to these amendments.  If there has been a default for a six-month period on a debt settlement or personal insolvency arrangement without notification by the debtor to his or her personal insolvency practitioner, it is clear that the arrangement is not likely to succeed.  I am not convinced, however, that the default period should be extended to nine months.

It would reduce the period of commencement of a review of the operation of a personal insolvency arrangement under the legislation from five years to one.  I have examined the issue of the length and scope of the review period and had hoped to be in a position to address it today.  However, I intend to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to apply a reduced review period of three years to all of the new insolvency processes under the Bill.  I do not think it would be practical or appropriate to review it after just one year of operation.  In the light of my intention to reduce the review period to three years, I ask the Senator to consider withdrawing the amendment, as this issue is not of huge importance.  It is of assistance to provide that there be a review.  It is practical to conduct such a review after seeing how things have been working for three years.  In real terms, the personal insolvency practitioner will always be there in the background.  If the circumstances of a debtor change, he or she will be able to contact the personal insolvency practitioner.  In effect, any arrangement put in place can be reviewed at any time, including after a change of circumstances.  That review can result in another meeting of creditors, if necessary.  If a personal insolvency arrangement has been entered into by a person who is in employment but he or she is made redundant after two years through no fault of his or her own, it will clearly have an impact on his or her capacity to make payments under an arrangement.  This would result in the personal insolvency practitioner being invoked back into the process and some engagement with creditors.  It is a good idea that there be a formal review.  In effect, it is likely in practical terms that arrangements will be made for a continuous review or engagement if circumstances change or unexpected difficulties arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400046#UU02000","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354650900,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354650900,"counter":457,"content":"<p>Section 85 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354650900,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Sections 86 and 87 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354650900,"counter":459,"content":"<p>SECTION 88<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1354650900,"counter":460,"content":"<p>As amendments Nos. 91 to 93, inclusive, are related, they may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400046#UU02500","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1354650900,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 91:<blockquote><br \/>In page 76, subsection (1)(<i>a<\/i>), line 47, to delete &#8220;&#8364;3,000,000&#8221; and substitute &#8220;&#8364;1,000,000&#8221;.<\/blockquote>I do not intend to press amendment No. 92.

It is interesting that after the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality held hearings on this matter, it expressed the view that the \u20ac3 million threshold for a personal insolvency arrangement was too low and recommended that it be raised to \u20ac10 million.  As I said on Second Stage, I was somewhat chastened to read a critical commentary on our report in a newspaper which suggested a threshold of \u20ac10 million would be far too high, as it would, in effect, reward moral hazard and irresponsible speculation.  The article in question suggested a threshold of \u20ac3 million was too high and that it should be closer to the threshold to be applied to people in debt in respect of a family home and perhaps other forms of debt.  Given that I raised this issue on Second Stage, I wonder whether the Minister has any comment to make on it.  Notwithstanding the recommendation made in the joint committee's report, it seems \u20ac3 million is the highest the threshold should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400046#UU02700","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1354651500,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Both amendments propose to reduce the indicative limit for the aggregate amount of secured debt that may be proposed in a personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, from \u20ac3 million to \u20ac1 million.  The Senator's proposals may be based on some comment of the troika in this regard.  Such comments were, I feel, based perhaps on an incomplete understanding of the innovative debt resolution proposals contained in the personal insolvency arrangement.<\/p><p>This arrangement essentially provides a rescue approach as opposed to the classic liquidation approach in bankruptcy.  This rescue approach is designed not only for whole mortgages but for all types of debt where a security is involved.  This will include viable or potentially viable sole trader-type businesses whose continued existence can sustain employment and economic activity.<\/p><p>The limit of \u20ac3 million is not the critical element here.  To a large degree, it is an indicative figure to assist the approach of debtors and creditors in considering their options.  We must remember we are providing an alternative option to bankruptcy.  Secured creditors can also consent not to apply the \u20ac3 million limit, by agreement.  This is a useful option to those concerned in trying to put together a workable debt resolution.  I suspect that if we reduce the amount as suggested by the Senator, it would not be long before I was faced with a request to increase it to ensure the success of the personal insolvency arrangement.<\/p><p>There is an extraordinary misunderstanding as to what this is about.  Debt settlement arrangements can be entered into for unsecured debt up to any level.  Therefore, if some individual has unsecured debt of \u20ac6 million, \u20ac7 million or \u20ac8 million, and if there are creditors willing to enter into arrangements, they can enter into arrangements under a debt settlement arrangement.  What is a debt settlement arrangement about?  It is about putting in place a structure that will facilitate the discharge of debts properly due over an extended period of time to the benefit of the creditor and also to the benefit of the debtor.  Why is this the case?  If the creditor cannot recoup payment because the debtor is practically insolvent, the alternative is that the debtor goes into bankruptcy and the creditor may recover very little because what the debtor is going to earn in the next five or six years becomes substantially irrelevant.  Moreover, as the debtor can extricate themselves from the debt, the creditor may not recover as much as they would otherwise recover under the debt settlement arrangement.<\/p><p>The same applies to a personal insolvency arrangement.  Let us say someone has a debt of \u20ac3 million to a financial institution.  Let us assume \u20ac1 million of that is debt relating to property, half of it to the family home and half to the business out of which they trade, and the other \u20ac2 million is moneys borrowed from the bank for the purpose of that business, which is now secured nominally on property but, due to the collapse of property values, this may no longer be providing adequate security.  What is this arrangement about?  The debtor cannot pay their debts so there are two choices.  First, the debtor may go into bankruptcy, in which case all of the assets may be sold, including the debtor's family home, and the debtor can be rendered homeless.  From the perspective of the financial institution, because it can get no benefit from the possible workings of the debtor over future years, it may not recover as much as it would otherwise recover, although, of course, it might get some benefit during the bankruptcy period.<\/p><p>The second choice is the PIA, whereby there will be a benefit for the debtor who has a reasonable family home that is not in the mansion class.  &quot;Mansion&quot; seems to be a trendy word to use this week and people are going to be very disappointed if their homes are not classified as mansions, if what we are reading in the newspapers is true.  Some homes that could have been regarded as mansions years ago apparently may not be, for all sorts of reasons.  We will not go there.  In any case, from the debtor's point of view, the benefit is they may retain their home.  From the creditor's point of view, they enter into an arrangement which may over a period of years result in them recouping a greater sum of what is due to them.<\/p><p>There is an idea that this is some great concession for wealthy people.  What it is, in fact, is the possibility of an arrangement for individuals who are financially bust and who have \u20ac3 million of nominally secured debt.  Somebody seemed to have an idea these are wealthy people who have \u20ac3 million.  If one has a debt of \u20ac3 million and is financially bust, one is a good deal less wealthy than a debtor whose debt is only \u20ac1 million.  Why would one exclude the possibility of a structured debt settlement arrangement which may, in fact, result in the debtor over a period of years having to pay off more of the debt, where the benefit to them is they may keep their home?  The other option is for the debtor to go into bankruptcy in which they may lose their home but the creditors may recoup less.  Of course, at the end of the day, where it is secured debt, if the secured creditors are not happy with the nature of the arrangement that could be entered into, or at least a portion of them are not happy, they will not enter into it.<\/p><p>The Oireachtas committee had it right and, much though it pains me to say it, the troika had it entirely wrong because it did not seem to understand the structure.  There is a case to be made that there should be no limit, either for debt settlement arrangements or personal insolvency arrangements.  At the end of the day, whether one enters into a structured resolution or not will depend on whether one can propose, through a personal insolvency practitioner, arrangements which appear common sense and practical to creditors and which, based on one's full financial disclosure, indicate to creditors they may recoup more of the money owing to them by that structure than going into bankruptcy.  There is no particular benefit in having any particular financial limit on this at all.  Nevertheless, we put in the figure of \u20ac3 million in part because there was a concern this might be misunderstood.<\/p><p>For those reasons, I oppose and disagree with the Senator's amendments.  I hope the Senator will take in good faith what I am saying.  Of course, there is a reality that everyone is forgetting.  The strange thing is that in past years and before this legislation comes into force, without individuals going into bankruptcy, debtors and creditors, with the assistance of intermediaries, have on occasion resolved debt issues by entering into settlements without these formal legal structures.  When this legislation is enacted, there is nothing to prevent a group of creditors who are owed a very large sum of money by a debtor getting together and, with the assistance of an intermediary or someone representing both sides, entering into a settlement for many millions of euros of debt that may exist.  To say the personal insolvency structure should only apply to very limited circumstances but individuals who want to co-operate can do so at any particular level just does not make sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400047#VV00100","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1354651500,"counter":464,"content":"<p>Before I call Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh, I welcome to the Visitors Gallery the members of the Trinity College Chapel Choir who sang at the turning on of the Christmas lights on our Christmas tree.

I will also deal with amendments Nos. 136 to 140, inclusive, and amendment No. 165.  The new Part V of the Bill comprising sections 147 to 174, proposed to be inserted by amendments Nos. 136 to 163, make provision for the regulation, supervision and discipline of PIPs.  The insolvency service will be responsible for the direct regulation of personal insolvency practitioners.  In response to the many representations I have received in this regard I wish to make clear that we will not be imposing any particular restrictions as the type of profession of persons who will be licensed to perform this function.  The practice in other countries is that such insolvency practitioners tend to be accountants or lawyers but can also be other professionals in the broad financial services sectors.  Many of these will already be regulated as appropriate by the Central Bank for the provision of other financial services.  This is the approach I intend to take. Suitable persons meeting the formal fitness to practise and competence criteria who have indemnity insurance and meet the other requirements of the legislation will be able to apply for registration on an individual, not corporate, basis.<\/p><p>  I will now deal with the detail of the new sections proposed to be inserted by amendments Nos. 136 to 140, inclusive.  Amendment No. 136 proposes the insertion of section 147, which provides for the interpretation of certain terms used in the new Part 5.  Amendment No. 137 proposes the insertion of section 148.  This new section provides that it will be an offence for a person to act as a PIP who is not entitled to do so by virtue of the legislation.  Amendment No. 138 proposes the insertion of section 149, which gives the insolvency service the power to make regulations for the purpose of the control and supervision of personal insolvency practitioners and the protection of debtors and creditors who are or may become parties to debt settlement arrangements or personal insolvency arrangements.  These regulations may provide for matters such as procedures governing the authorisation of persons to carry on practice as PIPs, standards to be observed by them, qualifications and requirements as to competence, and information they must provide to the insolvency service.  I mention in particular paragraph (<i>f<\/i>), which provides that the regulations may provide for the circumstances and purposes for which a personal insolvency practitioner may charge fees or costs or seek to recover outlays.  Amendment No. 139 proposes the insertion of section 150, which requires the insolvency service to establish and maintain a register of personal insolvency practitioners that will be published on the website of the insolvency service for the benefit of those who wish to identify individuals qualified to so act.  Amendment No. 140 proposes the insertion of section 151.  This section provides that an application for an authorisation to carry on practice as a PIP must be accompanied by certain specified evidence and documents as well as the prescribed fee.  Applicants must provide evidence as to their competence, including details of education, training and experience.  In particular, applicants must provide evidence of knowledge of relevant Irish insolvency legislation, which will include knowledge of this Bill.  Applicants must also furnish a certificate from an accountant certifying that proper financial systems and controls are or will be in place for the protection of moneys received from debtors.  They must also provide evidence of their professional indemnity insurance.  The insolvency service will make such inquiries and examinations as necessary with regard to an applicant's character, competence and financial position.  In light of the extensive provisions of the new Part 5, as outlined, I ask Senators to consider withdrawing their amendments regarding the regulation of PIPs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400048#WW03300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1354652100,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for making available to the House the briefing script on these detailed amendments.

It is not clear in regard to the provisions of the section, what the Senator's proposal seeks to achieve.  Clearly, he wants to encourage, and I agree, creditors to constructively engage.  Where the creditors are banks we want them to constructively engage.  To oblige someone to propose a solution to the borrower's problem would not work as one person's solution is another person's problem.  For example, what would be the Senator's reaction if the secured creditor - let us presume it is a bank - proposed full and immediate payment of the entirety of the loan or, alternatively, repossession of the property?  The financial institution might say the debtor has a problem and owes it a large amount of money and ask for the property.  As far as the financial institution is concerned that solves the debtor's problem and it also serves the problem of the financial institution.<\/p><p>The provision of the new personal insolvency arrangement is a significant solution to addressing the problems of debt, in particular, where a home mortgage might be concerned.  It involves an engagement, the personal insolvency practitioner having got a full disclosure of income, assets, liabilities, resources.  The debtor then engages with creditors to find out what is due to them, examines the financial reality and draws up a proposal on behalf of the debtor.  The hope is that the creditors will engage.  The incentive for creditors to engage is that it involves the prospect of them recouping all or a portion of what is due to them in circumstances where they may not otherwise do so, or if they do it may be somewhat less.  The other incentive is that if one does not do the deal and the debtor goes into bankruptcy one may also recover a great deal less. I understand the good intention behind the amendment but I do not think its inclusion in the Bill would add anything.  It could create a perception that creditors could simply demand something which they would see as a benefit and which might, from their perspective, solve the debtor's problem, but it may not be a desirable solution from the debtor's perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400049#XX02600","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1354652700,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I appreciate where the Minister is coming from and the Minister is right that it is well intended.

They engage to a certain extent but the solution is not always to the benefit of the person who owes them the money.  Perhaps the Minister would take on board the point we are trying to make and look at it again for Report Stage.  If the Minister is willing to do that we will withdraw the amendment with leave to bring it back on Report Stage.

The financial institutions have responded to people's short-term debt crises.  Forbearance arrangements have been in place in the past three or four years of the financial crisis and the collapse of property prices.  We know from statistics and information made available, that approximately 80,000 arrangements have been entered into which involve debt forbearance.  Where the financial institutions have been slow is in recognising that in certain circumstances debt forbearance is only kicking the can down the road and there is a need for debt forgiveness but that does not apply to everybody.<\/p><p>There are individuals who have the resources to meet their debts but, perhaps, they need an extended period in which to discharge them.  However, we have to be conscious that while trying to do what is practical and of assistance to people in debt, we also need financial institutions which are sound and do not have to be further recapitalised, that are lending money to people who want to buy homes and making funds available for business purposes to SMEs and larger businesses to assist in the creation of jobs.  There is a balance to be struck.<\/p><p>The financial institutions have engaged in a substantial debt forbearance.  I said this in the other House and I have said so here already.  There are many thousands of people who are in genuine financial difficulties, many through no fault of their own, many who bought properties, residential or investment, at the height of the boom, when the banks were throwing money at them like confetti at a wedding without undertaking due diligence that bore some reality to individual's financial circumstances.  There are many people caught in those circumstances.  For some of them, there is a need for the banks to engage in some level of debt forgiveness because there is no possibility of them meeting their capital obligations with respect of repayments way into the distant future, particularly given the collapse in property values.  It is about a balance.  It is good for a headline, although the Senator has not done this, to keep on kicking the financial institutions.  We must remember the Irish people have paid to recapitalise them.<\/p> <p>We need them to function correctly.  We need individuals who can afford to discharge debt to do so and to recognise the numbers who have no capacity to do so and will in the distant future need debt forgiveness.<\/p><p>I appreciate that the Senator's proposal is well intended, but I do not wish to mislead him.  The Government cannot produce a provision of this nature because it would be counterproductive.  It would not assist in anything.  What we hope will be of assistance is the new debt settlement architecture that will be put in place which will require the active engagement of debtors and creditors and we will keep under careful review to ensure there is active engagement.

We have come a long way in our analysis of the banking sector in terms of from where we have come and where we are now, but we are trying to acknowledge a David and Goliath scenario where people who might be in difficulty with a mortgage are not in as strong a negotiating position as the bank.  The repayments they have entered into with their banks which might be interest only and so on only kick can down the road, as the Minister said.  The substantial capital sum still remains to be repaid on properties that were significantly overvalued, but this is not being taken into consideration.  A mechanism is needed to address it.

Section 146(85D)(3) states: \"An order made under subsection (1) shall not require a bankrupt to make payments for a period of more than 5 years, but nothing in subsection (2) shall prevent a bankruptcy payment order having effect after the bankrupt has been discharged from bankruptcy.\"  In other words it seems as if the person in question is not bankrupt at all and that the unfortunate bankrupt may believe he will get out from under it after five years but in fact it could continue for a considerable period.  This may be the thinking behind the amendment, which would discharge the bankrupt with immediate effect.  In other words, it appears to be a proposal for a clean, definitive end to it.

With the likely increase in persons in bankruptcy from the current level of approximately 30 persons per year to a number likely to be in the low thousands, it is likely that persons adjudicated bankrupt may be in employment.  In this regard a bankruptcy payment order to repay some of the debt is appropriate.  However, we have no wish to impact on the incentive to retain or seek employment on the part of a debtor or have creditors seek to unduly penalise debtors in the timing of the application for orders.  I have given this matter some further thought and I am unsure whether it is possible to link the order directly to the discharge in the fashion suggested in the amendment.

He may not be doing it at all.  It is simply that I have several other questions relating to this and I was afraid that it might be withdrawn and that would terminate the discussion.<\/p><p>  In deciding to make the change from 12 years to three years, why have we not come into line with the United Kingdom?  I put the question because the dogs in the street know that there has been a succession of high-profile and not-so-high-profile people who have travelled across the Irish Sea, established their bona fides under United Kingdom law and been discharged as bankrupts after one year.  I do not intend to name them because we all know who they are.  For the life of me I do not understand it given the close nature of jurisprudence between Britain and Ireland.  We share a common law system and many other areas of the law.  I am baffled by the solution of the drafters of the legislation.  Clearly the Minister has given his <i>imprimatur<\/i> to it.  Why did the Minister not go the whole hog and simply go with one year?<\/p><p>  There is a culture in the United States that is something of a clich\u00e9 at this stage.  The idea is that one needs to have been made bankrupt at least twice or three times and one needs to have failed in one's businesses on several occasions before reaching the age of 30 years and then one becomes a multimillionaire and creates a business that will expand to the point where there is vast employment.  In other words, business failure is not seen as failure in the American entrepreneurial business culture.  Whereas here, despite or in spite of what has happened in recent years this is not the case.  I have much sympathy for anyone who ends up in the bankruptcy courts, but I realise it is not popular to single out those who made a great deal of money from being creative during the Celtic tiger years.  However when one boils it down, these people took a risk.  One can question their motives until the cows come home but they are people who took a risk.<\/p> <p>They are people who took a risk.  They were part of the entrepreneurial class or they joined it because they felt they had something creative to offer and whether it was for their own gain is irrelevant to this particular argument.  This country and this economy needs people who are prepared to take a risk, to put their money where their mouth is and to go the extra mile.  If it means they have ended up becoming hugely successful, financially, surely the benefits of it to the wider economy outweigh any issues of morality that people might have.  Some have stood on the high moral ground on many occasions in casting judgment on such people.  I know I am walking an extremely thin line here because I share the anger of the general public about the fact that there are people who have patently contributed to the economic disaster that has befallen this country who have yet to answer for their actions but who will, I hope, come before our courts in the fullness of time.  <\/p><p>I wished to elaborate on the context in which I am raising this issue and I am sorry if I have spoken for too long on the matter.  Essentially, it boils down to the question as to why there is a difference between the English and Irish laws on bankruptcy and why this difference will continue.  The people who have been declared bankrupt in the UK will be back in business within 12 months and the chances are that some of them will resurrect their careers, generate money and, by extension, generate jobs.  However, the jobs and the money will be in the British economy, not in the Irish one.  That is why I am curious about this issue.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister's remarks regarding revisiting the proposed amendment on Report Stage but is he saying that much of what is in the proposal relating to the amendment has not been clear enough?  The Minister seems to be suggesting that he will bring a degree of clarity to the legislation so that when somebody is declared as being discharged as a bankrupt, he or she will be effectively discharged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400052#AAA03000","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354655100,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and will relay his comments to Senator Crown on his return from the United States, where he is possibly imbibing some of that entrepreneurial spirit to which Senator Mooney referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400053#BBB00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1354655100,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I congratulate my colleagues for bringing forward this amendment and thank the Minister for taking the proposal on board.

It does not seem fair or equitable that those who can afford bankruptcy tourism can avail of it in England and those who cannot afford it are stuck with a system which, unless we change it along the lines suggested by Senators Crown and Barrett, could see them kept in a state of limbo by the banks for a lot longer than the three years being proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400053#BBB00300","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1354655100,"counter":645,"content":"<p>This debate is interesting and the contributions are following on from what was discussed on Second Stage.  It all relates to the question of the responsibility of the debtor, in so far as possible, to pay his or her debts and the responsibility of creditors, the State and its agencies to be fair.  Perhaps we should not be asking whether we should be chasing after the bankruptcy laws of the United Kingdom but how fair and appropriate those laws are.  For every person who enters bankruptcy and has his or her financial position regulated or resolved, there is still a legacy of people who are owed money and in some cases, substantial amounts of money.  Many of those people are in financial distress themselves.  We must try to balance justice with responsibility.  We must provide people with some degree of hope regarding the future and their ability to return to the economic sphere.<\/p><p>During previous discussions on bankruptcy in this House, many Senators conceded that the 12-year period was grossly long but suggested that a four or five-year period might be appropriate.  A three-year limit is probably at the end of the spectrum in terms of it providing assistance, an opportunity to begin again and hope, while also sending out a message about personal responsibility.  It would also send a message to creditors who would not necessarily be big banks or financial corporations but would also include sole traders, shopkeepers and so forth.  In so far as one can ever get any of these imponderable questions right, a three-year limit is probably as right as we can get it.  I am happy with the provision.  We cannot dispute the fact that there will be bankruptcy tourism but we must focus on getting our own jurisdiction in order.

There are always two sides to any equation.  I appreciate that the Minister is going to look at the issue raised by my colleagues and I ask him to clarify whether the slate is wiped clean after three years.  I thought that there would be some overhang, as I think was the case with the previous 12 year term, in terms of money owing to the Revenue Commissioners and the cost of the bankruptcy itself.  I am taking it that after three years, preferential creditors are not able to pin the bankrupt into a continuing bankruptcy situation and prevent him or her from trading.<\/p><p>The question about the three-year term is an interesting one and I would agree with Senator Bradford on the matter.  I have always felt that the 12-year term was far too long.  It was a throwback to the days of the law being drawn up by the privileged for the privileged.  We are now in a different scenario and in that context, the reduction of the term to three years is welcome.  However, we really are in unprecedented times.  The level of personal and business debt in Ireland now has never been experienced before and is akin to debt levels in other jurisdictions during the Great Depression of the 1930s.  In that context, there might be an argument for allowing people to get back into business.  I was struck by the point made by Senator Mooney regarding the exodus of business people to Britain to avail of its one-year bankruptcy term but we must balance that against the needs of creditors.  I believe that there is a case for a shorter term for a limited time.  Over the next three to five years we will see quite a number of bankrupts and the sooner those people are able to get out of their current situation and back into business, the better.  <\/p> <p>Where there are trade creditors involved, many of them have gone bankrupt themselves because of the knock-on effect from the failure of others, particularly in the building sector.  These people traded and did their work well but failed, perhaps because they were dependent on too few customers.  Once those customers became bankrupt and were unable to discharge the debts to them, they had to close business and in some cases became bankrupt.  This is a concern.  Everything we have done since 2008 has been far too favourable to the banking fraternity and the banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400053#BBB00500","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354655700,"counter":648,"content":"<p>The Senator is going outside the scope of the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400054#CCC00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1354655700,"counter":649,"content":"<p>Senator Bradford alluded earlier to situations where people are deprived of their house and property in cases of bankruptcy.

Perhaps it should be reviewed after 18 months, if possible.<\/p><p>I am mindful of the legislation in terms of company law, where a company can apply for examinership and go into court and get examinership and have 85% of its debts written down and then return to buoyancy.  I can think of a number of examples where this has happened, particularly hotels which got 85% of their debts written down.

First, the three-year period is chosen because it is the average period in most European Union countries.  England is an outlier in that it has a one-year period.  Second, we must have a balance in the legislation as between debtors and creditors and must give creditors some reasonable opportunity of recovering some moneys due to them.  Third, what we do in this Parliament should not be determined by Westminster.  We stopped that in 1922 and must make our own judgment on these things.  Fourth, some individuals who clearly have their centre of interest in and are resident in this State have found themselves refused access to the bankruptcy structure in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  In that context, we must make our own decisions.<\/p><p>It is annoying to see some individuals go to England and seek to extricate themselves.  However, there are other issues.  Why would people try to have their circumstances dealt with here?  The answer is that Northern Ireland and England do not have the equivalent of our personal insolvency arrangement, which creates the possibility of non-judicial debt settlement for secured debt.  That is not available in the United Kingdom.  There are a number of reasons.  On balance, the Government was of the view that three years should be the timeframe.<\/p><p>When we came into government, the legal position was that somebody could be bankrupt for their lifetime, as the provisions in the context of the period of bankruptcy had not been reformed since colonial times.  We reduced the period in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 to 12 years and are now reducing it to three years.  We want to ensure that the three-year period is a real three-year period and that it cannot be extended beyond that.  Hence, I made my previous comments in that regard.  In the UK and in Ireland, if someone is fraudulent going into bankruptcy and does not make full and proper disclosure of income or assets, the bankruptcy period in both jurisdictions will be extendable.  I do not believe this Parliament should have its substantive law determined by the Westminster Parliament.  The majority of people in major financial trouble will not go over to the United Kingdom to have their circumstances dealt with there.  They will deal with them under our domestic law.  We think we have achieved the appropriate balance in this legislation.<\/p><p>Proposals on bankruptcy will come from the European Union in December.  We hope to consider these and that will form part of the work we will do during the Irish Presidency.  We will examine those provisions in the context of how there can be more harmony across the European Union in jurisdiction issues dealing with the bankruptcy area.  However, the likelihood is that the United Kingdom will not opt into those provisions and the current position will remain as it is there for the foreseeable future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400054#CCC00500","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1354655700,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response and I appreciate the fact that he dealt with this on Second Stage.  However, because we are dealing with this amendment, which flowed from that and because of the Minister's positive response, I want to say I applaud him for his initiative and for what he has done with this Bill.  What he has said is correct.  The provisions as they stood were Dickensian in their effect and this change was long overdue.  I fully applaud the Minister in that regard.<\/p><p>I find it hard to put myself in a position where I am somehow seen to be defending a scenario wherein we are beholden to a foreign parliament, but that was not the point I was attempting to make.  What I stated as fact - acknowledged by all sides of the House - is that a number of high profile business people at the highest level who owed hundreds of millions of euro found the bankruptcy laws in this country so cumbersome that they felt that they had no choice but to go to the next jurisdiction, where bankruptcy is still for a one-year period.  Perhaps the British Parliament will change that, but I do not care about that.  The Minister will be aware there is a legal term of &quot;cause and effect&quot;.  All I was doing was highlighting a scenario where very high profile successful people - one can argue about the morality of their situation - were motivated not so much by trying to get away from their creditors as Senator Bradford seemed to think I was suggesting, but who, because they were genuinely committed to a business culture, wanted to get back into business as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>It will be instructive to establish over the next few years how, with regard to the number of the people who have gone before the bankruptcy courts with success in the United Kingdom, their careers pan out over the coming years.  I am not a betting man, but I suggest the chances are a high proportion of them will prove to be extremely successful in their reborn environment.  That was the reason I raised the comparison between Britain and Ireland.  What the Minister says is correct.  What is most important of all in this debate, going back to the amendment proposed by Senators Barrett and Crown, is that the Minister understands that three years should mean three years.

That legislation is simple, but effective and I plead with the Minister to give some consideration to it around the Cabinet table and to bring it forward, as it would protect sub-contractors from rogue and fly-by-night developers who walk away from their responsibilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400054#CCC00600","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354655700,"counter":653,"content":"<p>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1354655700,"counter":654,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400054#CCC00800","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1354655700,"counter":655,"content":"<p>At 10.30 a.m. tomorrow, Wednesday, 5 December 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400054#CCC00900","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Adjournment Matters","time":1354656300,"counter":656,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400055#DDD00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection","time":1354656300,"counter":657,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400055#DDD00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1354656300,"counter":658,"content":"<p>While I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to the House, I would have loved an opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, on the successful passage of the children's rights referendum.  We have not seen her in this House since the referendum, unfortunately.  I am raising the issue of direct provision on the Adjournment tonight.  Much of the public awareness and outcry about the abuse and mistreatment of children in State-run institutions followed the publication of a series of damning reports, including the Ferns, Ryan, Murphy and Cloyne reports and most recently the child death review report that was drawn up by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon and Ms Norah Gibbons.  In response to the latter report, I expressed my profound sadness and a sense of the responsibility and shame I bear as a member of a society that has systematically failed to protect our most vulnerable children.  As the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, remarked last year at the launch of an Amnesty International report, In Plain Sight: Responding to the Ferns, Ryan, Murphy and Cloyne Reports:<blockquote><br \/>At every turn, Irish people kept their mouths shut out of deference to state, system, church and community.  When they should have been unified in fury and outrage they were instead silenced, afraid to even whisper a criticism against the powerful.<\/blockquote>I am genuinely concerned that the situation for children in direct provision accommodation centres for asylum seekers will lead to a future Ryan report if we do not take immediate action.  I refuse to stay silently complicit.<\/p><p>  This is not an easy area to pursue.  At this juncture, I am focusing solely on the situation for children in direct provision.  I am finding it difficult to establish which ministerial remit covers which scenario.  I have previously raised the applicability of standard 3.4 of the HIQA national standards for the protection and welfare of children with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, on the Adjournment.  The standard in question stipulates that &quot;child protection and welfare services provided on behalf of statutory service providers are monitored for compliance with legislation, regulations, national child protection and welfare policy and standards&quot;.  In my opinion, the HIQA national standards for the protection and welfare of children clearly apply to children in direct provision.  They apply because the children in question are residing in accommodation facilities under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  They apply irrespective of the children's country of origin or the status of their parents.  They apply regardless of whether they are in the care of the State or cared for by the State.  They apply because contrary to what the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has suggested, it is simply not true that all children living in direct provision &quot;live in a family context and their parents or guardians have primary responsibility for their care and welfare&quot;.<\/p><p>  I would like to refer the House to a report drawn up by the Irish Refugee Council, State Sanctioned Child Poverty and Exclusion: The Case of Children in State Accommodation for Asylum Seekers, which was published in September of this year.  I would also like to mention the 2011 report of the special rapporteur, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, in which he highlights &quot;the specific vulnerability of children accommodated in the system of Direct Provision and the potential or actual harm which is being created by the particular circumstances of their residence including the inability of parents to properly care for and protect their children&quot;.  The HIQA national standards apply because the State has an obligation to ensure the health, safety and welfare of these children.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, has conceded that the HIQA standards &quot;apply to the HSE children and family services in the context of its role in dealing with children living in the direct provision system who are referred to it&quot;.  I assure the House that such referrals are capable of being made under the Reception and Integration Agency's child protection policy or by GPs and teachers, etc.  According to the HSE, these scenarios fall under the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I am seeking clarification on the number of referrals the HSE has received about children in direct provision accommodation centres.  I want to know whether the Minister shares my position that any centre from which a child welfare and protection referral is made should be subject to immediate inspection in accordance with the HIQA national standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400055#DDD00300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1354656300,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I thank Senator van Turnhout for raising this issue.  I will convey her concerns to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I am sorry that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is not here to reply.<\/p><p>The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, is a functional unit of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, which is a division of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The RIA is charged with providing accommodation and ancillary services to asylum seekers - adults and their children - under the direct provision system while their applications for asylum are being processed.  Direct provision centres are monitored three times a year, twice by Department of Justice and Equality staff and once by an external company.  Under the Children First national guidance for the protection and welfare of children, any concerns about the welfare, safety or well-being of a child should be reported to the HSE children and family services.  The child protection and welfare policy of the RIA reflects this practice.<\/p><p>The HSE received approximately 31,000 reports last year.  Reports regarding children residing in direct provision accommodation are included in this number.  The RIA has advised that 171 referrals, regarding a range of child protection and welfare concerns involving family units in direct provision accommodation, were made to the HSE children and family services in 2011.  These included a significant number of welfare concerns such as a parent being hospitalised, parental illness, a child being left unsupervised by an adult, and mental health concerns regarding the parent, etc.  A smaller number of referrals related to child protection concerns.  Such referrals can be made under the RIA's child protection policy by staff and other residents, but may also be made by GPs and teachers, etc.  A specific unit within the RIA - the child and family services unit - is responsible for managing, delivering, co-ordinating, monitoring and planning all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system.  This unit also links, where necessary, directly with the Garda.<\/p><p>As the Senator's question relates specifically to the application of the HIQA national standards for the protection and welfare of children, I wish to outline the position regarding these standards.  In July 2010, the Government decided to prioritise the inspection of the HSE's child protection service by the Health Information and Quality Authority.  The first of these inspections took place this month.  The inspections are undertaken against standards developed by HIQA as provided for under the Health Act 2007.  As part of the inspection process, HIQA inspects the HSE's child protection service at all levels, from national management to social work team level.<\/p><p>HIQA developed the national standards for the protection and welfare of children in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders.  The national standards apply to the HSE children and family services and the performance by the HSE of the duties placed on the HSE under section 3 of the Child Care Act 1991.  The standards set out the key features of an effective child protection service.  They clearly put the needs of children at the heart of that service and promote the principles outlined in Children First, the national guidance for the protection and welfare of children.  The standards are designed to follow a child's journey within the HSE child protection system to ensure his or her safety is being protected.  They describe how the services should be provided and examine the use of resources, information and management of services.  The national standards apply to the HSE children and family service in the context of its role in dealing with all referrals to the service, including referrals regarding children living in direct provision accommodation.  It is essential to ensure children's safety is being protected while they are receiving a service within the HSE child protection system.<\/p> <p>It is critical that services for children are of a high standard and it is important to set out clearly what a child and his or her family can expect from the HSE children and family services.  We need good practice in child protection to be applied uniformly and these standards are a key part of that.  They will be a critical aspect of the external quality assurance infrastructure and will support continuous improvements to children's services into the future.<\/p><p>HIQA currently inspects all residential services run by the HSE for children who are in the care of the State.  HIQA does not inspect the accommodation provided under the direct provision system or other similar services such as homeless services or refuges for those experiencing domestic violence.  Children living in the direct provision system are not in the care of the State.  All live in a family context and their parents or guardians have primary responsibility for their care and welfare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400055#DDD00400","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354656900,"counter":661,"content":"<p>While I appreciate the Minister of State may not be able to answer this question, I have a huge difficulty in differentiating between \"in the care of the State\" and \"cared for by the State\".  These children are being directly cared for by the State.  If one visits any of these direct provision centres, children are not necessarily in a normal family context and there may be two or three families in one room.  I have a difficulty with this and I will continue to pursue this question.  I feel the response is a fudge.<\/p><p>On the question I asked about standards, are we basically saying the HIQA standards do not apply and that no child protection standards apply?  Must we wait for requests from the very people whose applications are being decided on by the Department of Justice and Equality and who do not want to upset that Department?  It would be the equivalent of asking Irish families who are receiving social welfare payments to get the Department of Social Protection to investigate itself.

The issue they raise is the inherent unfairness of the household charge.  A different level of service is provided in different counties.  Many people moving to County Meath from County Dublin, including Fingal, are shocked to find there is no parks department in County Meath, which is a major feature of Fingal County Council and of public interaction with the council.  There are differences in the level of service provided to different estates based on whether they have or have not been taken in charge.  I am aware of an estate in Stamullen where the lights are not working but it is not of a sufficiently low standard for the residents to be exempt from the household charge.  They are getting a lower level of service yet they are required to pay the \u20ac100 charge and, presumably, will have to pay the property tax next year.  Within the local authority areas in County Meath, there is a further difference in the level of service, whereby people actually get more services from the local authority if they live in a town council area.  While I want to protect and enhance that, the fact remains that people in a county area pay the \u20ac100 while people in a town area also pay \u20ac100 for a different level of service.<\/p><p>The Government made a huge mistake when it promoted the household charge as funding local services because people see these discrepancies and say &quot;It is not fair.  That person is getting a better service than me although I pay the same \u20ac100&quot;.  Many believe they get nothing for their \u20ac100 and, while that is not entirely correct, there is a ring of truth to it.  I met a woman in Ashbourne, County Meath, who owes \u20ac600 every year to her management company for the upkeep of her estate, which is not a walled-in or gated estate and has a public open space within it.  In addition, she has to pay \u20ac100 to Meath County Council, which she feels is an unjust charge that is being imposed when she is not getting the required level of service.<\/p><p>There are huge inequities with the household charge, particularly with regard to different levels of service.  The Government should look at what local authorities are doing and should be doing and adjust the household charge accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400056#EEE00400","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1354656900,"counter":665,"content":"<p>The EU-IMF programme of financial support, which was signed up to by Senator Byrne's party, contains a commitment to introduce a property tax for 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400056#EEE00500","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1354656900,"counter":666,"content":"<p>That will lose them votes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400056#EEE00600","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1354656900,"counter":667,"content":"<p>The programme reflects the need to put the funding of locally delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with demand.  It was considered that, in light of the complex issues involved, a local property tax would take time to introduce and, accordingly, the Government decided to introduce a household charge in 2012 as an interim measure.<\/p><p>An appropriate broadening of the revenue base for local government will be achieved through the household charge and the forthcoming full local property tax, which is important in ensuring that local authorities have the necessary resources to continue to deliver services to their communities.  As this topic demonstrates, the introduction this year of the household charge and the introduction next year of the local property tax have an additional benefit, beyond that of a more sustainable system of funding the local government sector, in that a local property tax will direct attention to the local services that are being funded by that tax.  Citizens will, I hope, engage with their local elected representatives in a new fashion to address the services that are being provided and the quality of those services, thereby altering in a meaningful way the relationship between the taxpayer citizen and the local authority which is funded by those taxes.  This change in the local dynamics of accountability will, I believe, have a transformative beneficial impact over the long run, further reinforced by the general programme of local government reform.<\/p><p>The diverse services provided by local government are very important for our collective well-being.  The range of local authority services include the following: road maintenance and cleaning; libraries; fire and emergency services; street lighting; parks and other recreation and cultural public amenities; spatial and development planning and other similar services; regulatory and inspection functions; and business support services.  All primary local authorities provide such services.  Crucially, they also provide democratic representation for communities, which is a unique function of local authorities.  We all benefit from the services local authorities provide, even when such benefits accrue at a community level, such as from the positive contribution libraries make to society as a whole, or the benefit of having access to services one may need in the future, such as fire and emergency services.<\/p><p>The household charge and the local property tax are not intended to reflect the degree to which an individual household, or set of households, receive services.  Liability is not reflective of service usage at any one point in time, not least because such a mechanism, in my view, would be regressive and inefficient.  Rather, funding from property-related taxes reinforces the link between decisions on service provision as a whole in a local authority and the funding of those services.

The committee's terms of reference state at paragraph 9:<blockquote><br \/>Subject to a minimum total of 18 and a maximum total of 40 members of every other council -<br \/>- there should be one member for every 4,830 population in each council area ...<\/blockquote>Therefore, based on the population threshold of 4,830 people per councillor, counties such as Roscommon, Leitrim and Sligo would have the minimum number of councillors, which is 18.  The terms of reference continue:<blockquote>... in addition, and subject to a maximum of four additional members per council except where councils are merging:<br \/>- in counties where there are existing town councils there should be four additional members per Borough Council and one additional member per Town Council ...<\/blockquote>  In my first reading of the terms of reference, Sligo, which is one of the five boroughs in the country, similar to Kilkenny, would have 18 councillors plus an additional four in lieu of the borough council that is moving.  Around Leinster House, however, and from talking to colleagues from Fine Gael and the Labour Party, I have heard the suggestion that there is in fact a maximum of 18, including the additional four.  I seek clarification on the question of whether Sligo is to have 18 or 22 councillors.<\/p> <p>In the event that the maximum is 18, I wish to make the case, while acknowledging the expertise of Professor Gary Murphy in this regard, for additional councillors for the ninth largest urban centre in the country.  We are all supportive of the need for rationalisation, savings and more efficient local government, as difficult as that is for all parties and councillors, but we must not throw out the baby with the bathwater.  <\/p><p>The Minister of State, in her capacity as Minister with responsibility for housing, visited the Cranmore regeneration project in Sligo town last week.  While the population within the borough is approximately 19,000, when account is taken of the population of the suburbs it is between 23,000 and 24,000, which means there are additional demands and a need for additional councillors to adequately cater for the people and the many diverse problems that come with a large area.  The Minister of State will have seen the good work being done through the Cranmore regeneration project.  In the event that the maximum is 18, then the budgetary situation in the Sligo area - which is, as I said earlier, effectively the ninth largest urban centre in the country - with the council already \u20ac73 million in debt and the old borough unable to balance its books, will be a challenge for those few councillors versus their colleagues who, obviously, are doing their best for the people in their particular areas.<\/p><p>We need clarification on this matter.  I hope the clarification provided by the Minister of State will not be in line with the rumours circulating around the Houses for the past number of weeks.  If so, there will be a need to move quickly to rectify this situation in the context of the five boroughs to ensure that where the population falls below the level required to ensure an automatic 18 councillors, this can be increased to 22 so as to in some way compensate for the loss of the borough while adhering to the theme of efficiencies and savings to the State.  We must ensure there is not a lack of representation for larger urban centres such as Sligo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400056#EEE00800","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354657500,"counter":671,"content":"<p>I thank Senator MacSharry for raising this issue.  My visit to Sligo last week was very positive.  I was impressed by what is being done there, particularly in Cranmore.  I hope I can clarify the situation for the Senator.<\/p><p>The action programme for effective local government, &quot;Putting People First&quot;, was published on 16 October 2012.  It sets out Government policy for reform across all the main areas of local government - namely, structures, functions, funding, operational arrangements, governance, the role of the executive and the elected council and engagement with local communities.  The most fundamental reorganisation of local government structures since the present system began in the 1800s will be undertaken.  A number of city and county local authorities will be unified; there will be extensive change at regional level, with rationalisation of structures and updating of functions, and at sub-county level a new system of municipal governance will be introduced.  This will involve the comprehensive territorial configuration of each county into municipal districts in which the elected members will perform a range of important local functions on a fully devolved basis.  The districts will be designed, as far as possible, around existing municipal towns and large urban centres which do not currently enjoy municipal status.  Overall, the number of council seats will reduce from 1,627 to no more than 950.<\/p><p>My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, announced the appointment of an independent statutory local electoral area boundary committee on 15 November 2012 to carry out a local electoral area review, on which the new municipal districts will be based.  The electoral review also has the specific goal of achieving better balance and consistency in representational ratios, while taking particular account of factors such as the location of towns and local identities in the new municipal governance arrangement.  The terms of reference for the review contain the parameters defining the total number of seats on each council, including a weighting to be applied to take account of existing municipal towns. These take account of the significant population changes that have taken place since the current numbers were decided while at the same time ensuring adequate numbers for effective representation and governance in counties with lower populations.<\/p><p>The committee will review and make recommendations on local electoral area boundaries in the context of the results of the 2011 census and the action programme for effective local government.  It has been asked to report to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government no later than 31 May 2013 and to review and make recommendations on the division of each council area, other than Cork city, into local electoral areas and to make recommendations on the number of members of each council to be assigned to each local electoral area.<\/p><p>The number of members for Dublin city and for Cork county are specified at paragraph 8 in the terms of reference.  As already outlined by Senator MacSharry, for all other councils, as specified in paragraph 9, the numbers will be calculated on the basis of one member for every 4,830 of population, with additional members where there are existing borough and town councils and merging city and county councils.  Those additions are subject to a maximum of four, except where councils are merging.  These calculations are all subject to a minimum total of 18 and a maximum total of 40 members as set out in paragraph 9 of the terms of reference.  Therefore, each of the five counties with borough councils will be allocated four members additional to the number of members by reference to population, plus the relevant town council addition, but subject to the limits set in the terms of reference on the maximum additions and on the overall number of members of the council.<\/p><p>It is a matter now for the committee to proceed with its work.  We await its recommendations, which are due in May 2013.  I have replied in general on the issue rather than specifically with regard to Sligo.

I am sure the legal eagles would have good fun with that.  As I understand it, places such as Sligo and Kilkenny will have 18 members plus an additional four.  However, the view among the Minister of State's colleagues and others is that the maximum is 18.  While I do not wish to disenfranchise County Leitrim, the population there is approximately 32,000, while the population in Sligo is approximately 66,000.

One of the recommendations contained in that report is that St. Patrick's College in Dublin be merged with Dublin City University and the Mater Dei Institute and that a new centre be based at the St. Patrick's College campus in north Dublin.  The Church of Ireland College of Education is also involved in the process and is to be amalgamated into a new institute of education in Drumcondra.  I understand the Minister supports this recommendation.  The report has been sent to the Higher Education Authority, which has been asked to put meat on the bones of the recommendations and report back to the Minister.  I am not sure whether the Minister has received that report yet.  Following receipt of the report from the HEA, the Minister will bring its recommendations and findings to Cabinet. <\/p><p>The Church of Ireland teacher training college in Rathmines is unique in that it provides for a minority religious ethos in this State.  Therefore, the individuals who attend the college are predominantly of Church of Ireland origin.<\/p> <p>There would be a constitutional issue if the college were to be merged with another, in this instance a Catholic one, as it would dilute the ethos of a minority religion.  That would present a constitutional challenge and be a step too far.  All religions should be catered for equally under the Constitution which the Government has a responsibility to uphold on behalf of the people.  If any such amalgamation takes place, it will be contrary to what is written and enshrined in the Constitution.<\/p><p>There was an attack on Church of Ireland and Protestant primary schools in last year's budget in that smaller schools were attacked.  This had a disproportionate effect on Church of Ireland schools.  This represents a further attack.  The Minister of State might indicate what is the position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400057#FFF01100","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354658100,"counter":682,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank Senator Brian \u00d3 Domhnaill for sharing time with me.<\/p><p>I wish to relate some extra information.  Last night I attended a meeting of senior academics and fellows in Trinity College Dublin at which there was great dismay that TCD could lose its connection with teacher training.  Surely the highest ranking university could have no more important task than linking with the training of teachers.  There is dismay and also confusion as to how this happened.  How did friends fall out?  It would certainly be the view of that body of academics that it would be a bad day for Ireland were this to happen.  It is a very important job of any university to relate to people up to the age of 14 years in post-primary schools and any abdication of that role would be bad for Trinity College Dublin, the Church of Ireland College of Education and Ireland as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400058#GGG00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1354658100,"counter":683,"content":"<p>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn.  I thank the Senators for raising it.<\/p><p>The Minister has accepted the recommendations set out in a report commissioned by the Higher Education Authority on the structures for initial teacher education, ITE.  The purpose of the report was to identify new structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland in order that it might be comparable with the best in the world.  The international panel of education experts which conducted the review recommended that teacher education be provided in six centres for teacher education.  Currently, there are 19 State-funded providers of ITE and three non-State funded providers, offering more than 40 college programmes in primary and post-primary teaching.<\/p><p>Changes are under way to the content and length of teacher education, with a greater emphasis on literacy, numeracy and pedagogical skills.  The structural changes will complement the curricular reforms under way and assist in positioning Ireland at the forefront of teacher education.  We know from research that the quality of our education system cannot exceed the quality of our teachers, which is why the Minister is driving changes at both a structural and content level in teacher education.  The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that there will be a smaller number of centres for ITE, but they will offer education across multiple sectors, from early childhood to primary and post-primary to adult education.  These centres of teacher education will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions.  The new configurations will mean that strong research bases will be cemented in each centre.  The report recommends the following configurations: Dublin City University - St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra and the Mater Dei Institute of Education; Trinity College Dublin - Marino Institute of Education, University College Dublin and the National College of Art and Design; National University of Ireland, Maynooth - Froebel College; University of Limerick - Mary Immaculate College and the Limerick Institute of Technology; University College Cork - Cork Institute of Technology; and the National University of Ireland, Galway - St. Angela's College, Sligo.  <\/p><p>The review panel also suggested the Church of Ireland College of Education would be suitably positioned to join any of the first three new configurations.  The Minister has made it clear to the college authorities that while he cannot support them remaining on their current campus, he is happy for them to negotiate their own destiny, consistent with their desire to protect their ethos within the broad parameters of the HEA report.  The college has signalled its intention to join DCU, St Patrick's College, Drumcondra and the Mater Dei Institute.<\/p><p>The review is in keeping with the recommendations in the national strategy of higher education 2030, or the Hunt report, which sees local, regional and international collaboration as the key to higher education system development.  It will also form part of a wider review of the entire higher education landscape which is under way by the HEA.<\/p><p>Ireland continues to attract the highest calibre of students into the teaching profession.  The Minister believes the restructuring of teacher education which he has initiated will mean these top performing students will receive an education that will equip them to become the best possible teachers.  He has asked the HEA to submit a detailed report before the end of the year on how to implement the recommendations of the panel.  It is too early to set out precise timelines or plans for individual colleges.  The Minister will consider the implementation plan from the HEA in full and will then report back to the Cabinet in the new year with more formal proposals, including proposals for the Church of Ireland College of Education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400058#GGG00300","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1354658100,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and appreciate her response was a script from the Department of Education and Skills.  At least, no decision has been made - that is the only thing we can say.  However, the Minister has outlined that he cannot support the Church of Ireland College of Education remaining on its current campus where it has been located since 1969.  Management of the college may have one view, but from speaking to parents and clergy members of the Church of Ireland, I know they have a very different one.  This should be taken into consideration.<\/p><p>I refer to the amalgamation of the NUIG with St. Angela's College in Sligo.  That is a non-runner.  The best possible attainment in educational output and teacher training is achieved at the college.  Thirteen students apply for every place on offer at the college.  If it were to be amalgamated with the university in Galway, there would be no teacher training college north of a line running from Dublin to Galway.  This would be a retrograde step and a campaign is under way in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400058#GGG00400","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1354658100,"counter":685,"content":"<p>I reiterate that I will convey to the Minister the concerns of the Senators in regard to St. Angela's College, Sligo and the Church of Ireland College of Education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120400058#GGG00600","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354658100,"counter":686,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 9.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 5 December 2012.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
