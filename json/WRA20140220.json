This focus is further underpinned by the commitments contained in the &quot;Access to Finance&quot; chapter in the soon to be published Action Plan for Jobs 2014.

The sales process plan and timeline for the sale of the residential mortgage portfolio has been developed following professional advice and in light of requirements for a robust and credible sales process in that context. The Special Liquidators have given significant consideration to and have sought independent advice from PWC in relation to how the residential mortgage portfolio is to be dealt with. Following that independent advice, the Special Liquidators have decided that the residential mortgage would be sub-divided into four tranches with a view to maximising market interest and return within the timelines set out in the Ministerial Instructions.\u00a0I am advised that it is for this reason that the Special Liquidators have decided not to accept any bids from individual mortgage holders. <\/p><p>  Neither I nor my officials had any role in the development of the sales process plan for the residential mortgage book and\u00a0given the Special Liquidators obligations to ensure that maximum value is obtained for all creditors of the bank it is not possible for me to interfere in\u00a0such\u00a0decisions. For example\u00a0the valuation price for performing mortgages is likely to be much higher than some of the discounts suggested in recent commentary, it would not be possible for me to direct the Special Liquidators to dispose of these loans to individual mortgage holders at such discounts as to do so would erode significant value for creditors and leave me open to challenge.<\/p><p>  The valuation process for the residential mortgage portfolio was completed on 11 September 2013 and the sales process commenced on 14 October 2013. Following receipt of indicative bids, a reduced number of bidders were progressed to Phase 2 of the sales process which launched on 29 November 2013. The Special Liquidators expect to finalise the sale of these loans in March 2014.<\/p><p>  For operational reasons, IBRC loan assets have been grouped into a number of portfolios which have been ascribed project names Evergreen, Sand, Rock and Salt, Stone and Pebble; In total, there are 15,734 Borrower Groups comprising 24,632 loans for sale across the 7 portfolios. In total only 33 of these Borrower Groups, representing 0.2% of total Borrower Groups were\/ are being offered for sale on a stand-alone basis. <\/p><p>  The first portfolio sale brought to the market by the Special Liquidators was concluded successfully in early December where the Evergreen portfolio achieved sales to third parties of 84% of the total portfolios at values above the independent valuations. The sales processes for the Sand, Rock, Salt, Stone and Pebble portfolios are all on going and it is therefore too early to comment on what percentage of each portfolio will be sold to third parties or will transfer to NAMA at the valuation price. However, the Special Liquidators are pleased with the level of interest shown by investors in the portfolios to date.<\/p><p>  The Special Liquidators will not be providing details of the discount applied to loan assets to arrive at the valuation price or the price at which the loan books are subsequently sold at as this information is commercially sensitive information which could potentially have a detrimental impact on asset recovery from the impending sale process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000052#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Resolution Processes","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000052#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[8385\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000052#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether arrears in the sub-prime mortgage sector are being adequately addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>The Central Bank has advised that there is no such regulated category as 'sub-prime' lender but that phrase is sometimes used to refer to some non-deposit taking 'retail credit firms'. Retail credit firms are a regulated category of entities which are authorised to provide credit (in the form of cash loans) directly to individuals.

However, the same consumer protection framework applies to retail credit lenders as to other regulated lenders including the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA). As such the Central Bank engages with these firms in relation to their treatment of borrowers under the mortgage arrears resolution process as provided for in the CCMA. In particular, the CCMA sets out requirements for all mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, dealing with borrowers facing or in arrears on a mortgage secured on a primary home and provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their co-operating borrowers in mortgage difficulty.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The Central Bank has informed me that retail credit firms were also included in the scope of the Central Bank's recent review of the 'Implementation of the Revised CCMA' by mortgage lenders, the purpose of which was to ensure that mortgage lenders achieved full implementation of the requirements of the revised CCMA by end December 2013.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank has advised this category of lender is putting in place solutions to address the mortgage arrears difficulty some borrowers are facing.\u00a0 There are 17,807 principal dwelling houses accounts in this category of which 4,341 have been restructured.\u00a0 In addition, out of the 659 buy-to-let mortgage accounts, the Central Bank has advised that 68 have been restructured.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank continues to engage with all mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, in relation to lenders' mortgage arrears resolution strategies and approaches to dealing with borrowers in or facing arrears.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving cases of mortgage difficulty.\u00a0 Where there is effective and meaningful engagement regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000052#WRA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Debt Issues","counter":22,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000052#WRA01550"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[8276\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000052#WRA01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total national debt in absolute figures and as a percentage of GDP for the years 2007 to 2013, inclusive; and the total interest paid in each of these years.

","asker":"999","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":45,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the extent of the illicit cigarettes market in Ireland is estimated through annual surveys of smokers.\u00a0 These surveys are undertaken for Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive by IPSOS MRBI. The survey for 2012 found that 13% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland are illicit. The comparable figure for 2011 was 14%. This would suggest that the extent of the problem is being contained, as a result of the extensive action being taken against the smuggling and sale of illicit product. A further survey was carried out at the end of 2013 and\u00a0the results of this will be available in the coming months.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will of course appreciate that estimating the scale of any illegal activity and the resultant tax loss is difficult. I am however satisfied that the IPSOS MRBI survey is the best indicator of the extent of the market in illicit cigarettes.\u00a0 This is because of the methodologies used and the consistent manner in which the survey has been undertaken over a number of years. In addition, the survey methodology is, unlike other methodologies such as empty pack surveys, capable of distinguishing between legal personal imports and illicit cigarettes. The survey is also geographically representative and, unlike others, takes social class, age, gender and nationality into account.<\/p><p>  In looking at the higher estimates of the level of illicit consumption that come from other sources, it needs to be borne in mind that the tobacco industry claims must be viewed in terms of their interest in minimising tax increases while imposing significant price increases of their own.  Data from the IPSOS MRBI surveys would indicate nominal annual losses in the order of &euro;258 million and &euro;240 million, in excise duty and VAT, in 2011 and 2012 respectively.<\/p><p>  I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that combatting the illegal tobacco trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for them. Their work against this illegal activity includes a range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. This multifaceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country.<\/p><p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.<\/p><p>  There is extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combatting the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the state also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market. In addition, cooperation takes place with other Revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing programmes to tackle the illicit trade at international level.<\/p><p>  In relation to tackling this problem in border counties in particular, Revenue advise me that they have an enforcement presence at key strategic locations in the border counties, and enforcement strength is regularly augmented with additional personnel on a risk assessment basis, or when particular operations against illegal activity are taking place. 10.66 million illicit cigarettes were seized in Revenue's Border Midlands West Region in 2013, and there were 15 convictions during 2013 arising from detections in the Region of the selling or smuggling of illicit tobacco products.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners will remain committed to acting against all stages of the supply chain for illicit tobacco products and will continue to make very effort to ensure that those involved in the illicit trade are brought to account before the Courts for their criminal activities.

The Commission\u00a0 published its final Report in March 2012\u00a0and identified\u00a0the financial position of credit unions in Ireland, stating that the declining fortunes of the Irish economy have not only put an additional brake on credit union development but have contributed to regression in some credit unions. To address\u00a0this the Commission set out a wide range of measures, including,\u00a0specifically in relation to\u00a0the stability of the sector,\u00a0recommendations regarding restructuring, stabilisation and resolution.<\/p><p>  A core recommendation was that the sector be restructured on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis to enable credit unions benefit from economies of scope and scale. The Government contributed &euro;250 million to the Credit Union Fund in December 2012 to support the restructuring of the credit union sector which is being overseen and facilitated by the Credit Union Restructuring Board - ReBo. Any funding provided to credit unions will be on a recoupable basis.\u00a0ReBo is working to the timetable set out in the Commission's report and is expected to complete its work by the end of 2015. <\/p><p>  The Commission also recommended that a statutory stabilisation fund be established to address problems in credit unions that are under-capitalised but are otherwise viable. The statutory basis for stabilisation is in place under the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 and my Department will begin consultation on the introduction of the stabilisation levy this month. The target is to have a stabilisation levy in place by end quarter 2 2014.<\/p><p>  Another recommendation\u00a0\u00a0of the Commission was that the powers provided by the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 should be considered\u00a0for those credit unions that meet the conditions or grounds as set out in that Act. The Government has provided resolution funding of &euro;250 million. Funding will be based on recoupment over the medium term\u00a0by a levy under the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011. <\/p><p>  The Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 implements over sixty of the Commission's recommendations which will help\u00a0underpin the stability of the sector. The Act contains measures to reform and strengthen credit unions over four broad areas namely: Prudential regulation;\u00a0Governance measures;\u00a0Restructuring and\u00a0\u00a0Stabilisation.\u00a0\u00a0The Act is being commenced in accordance with the published Implementation Plan, which\u00a0allows credit unions sufficient time to prepare for these changes.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that these measures, together with governance and regulatory changes, introduced on foot of the Commission Report will underpin a stable credit union sector into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000053#WRB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Arrears Proposals","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000053#WRB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[8349\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000053#WRB00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the way he has communicated to the banks that under the MART process letters threatening legal action do not constitute a sustainable offer.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":51,"content":"<p>The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) places an onus on the banks, in respect of a co-operating borrower, to explore all the options for an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender to address a primary dwelling mortgage difficulty before any legal action is considered.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, under the MART process, the Central Bank is requiring the main lenders to work through their mortgage accounts\u00a0in arrears of more than 90 days and, where possible, to propose and conclude sustainable restructures with their borrowers in arrears.\u00a0 The Central Bank has indicated that all six mortgage lenders covered by the MART process have reported that they met the 20% proposed sustainable solutions target for the second quarter of 2013 and also the 30% target for the third quarter in 2013.\u00a0 In particular, with respect to the third quarter 2013 target, which is the latest available data, the lenders have reported to the Central Bank they had issued proposals to 43% of mortgage accounts in arrears against the 30% target.\u00a0 In that context the Central Bank has also advised that its MART publication of last March clearly indicates the where a lender relies on legal action to address an arrears situation it must be able to demonstrate that an alternative arrangement could not be reached or is not appropriate. Furthermore, if such a decision is made by the lender, the cooperating borrower has the right to appeal a decision not to offer an alternative repayment arrangement.<\/p><p>  Of course, the CCMA and MART can only work in circumstances where the borrower cooperates with the lender and engages with the process.\u00a0 Where this does not happen, the lender may have no other option but to go down the legal route to deal with an arrears case.\u00a0 However, if that course of action leads the borrower to commence a constructive engagement, this can lead to a more favourable outcome for the respective parties. The Deputy may wish to note, that according to information collected by my Department, in the case of private dwelling homes some 51,000 mortgage accounts in difficulty have been the subject of permanent restructuring following engagement between borrower and lender.\u00a0 A further 21,000 mortgage accounts in difficulty have been the subject of temporary restructures.<\/p><p>  The strong view of the Government is that, in respect of co-operating borrowers under the Central Bank's MART process, repossession of a person's primary home should only be considered as a last resort and that every effort should be made to agree a sustainable arrangement as an alternative to repossession.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  It is important to point out, however, that even if a repossession case has commenced in the legal system, the Land and Conveyancing (Law Reform) Act 2013 now provides a power to the Court to adjourn a repossession proceeding in relation to a principal private residence to enable the borrower to consult a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP) and, where appropriate, to instruct the PIP to make a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) proposal.\u00a0 In formulating a proposal for a PIA, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 places an onus on a PIP to do so on terms that shall not insofar as reasonably practicable, require the borrower to dispose of an interest or cease to occupy a principal private residence.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  I have informed the Deputy previously that letters threatening repossession or legal action could not in my opinion be considered a sustainable solution under the mortgage arrears targets, and should only ever be considered after every possible avenue for solution has been exhausted. I can assure the Deputy that I have expressed this view to the lenders and my officials are keeping in regular contact with the lenders on this important issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000053#WRB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Reductions","counter":52,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000053#WRB00850"},{"type":"question","counter":53,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[8247\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000053#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to introduce further fiscal measures to incentivise the tourism and services sectors, such as the extension of the 9% VAT rate to other service operators; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":54,"content":"<p>VAT is charged on the supply of goods and services, and the rate applying is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.\u00a0 While the majority of tourist related services apply at 9% it is not possible to extend this treatment to all tourist activity, such as tour guide services, and the short-term hire of cars, boat, caravans and mobile homes, which currently apply at the 13.5% reduced rate.

The first issue is the global rate of tax which is paid by multinational companies.\u00a0 This is a 'blended' rate and takes into account the amount of tax charged across all of the countries that a company trades in and not just Ireland. <\/p><p>  The extremely low effective rate figures quoted in the research paper referred to in the question are based on a flawed premise.\u00a0 They are running together the profits earned by group companies in Ireland and in other jurisdictions and incorrectly suggesting that Irish tax does or should apply to both.<\/p><p>  The figures are estimated by dividing the amount of Irish tax paid by a total profit figure that includes substantial profits made by companies that are not tax resident in Ireland.  Ireland cannot tax profits that are properly attributable to other jurisdictions.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The ability of some multinationals to lower their world-wide rate of tax using international structures reflects the global context in which Ireland and indeed all countries operate.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The best way to effectively address this issue is for countries to work together at the international level and the appropriate action is being considered in this regard by the OECD as part of their project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and Ireland is participating fully in this process.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The second issue is the effective rate of tax applying in individual countries.\u00a0 Clearly, the domestic rate of tax paid in Ireland is within the control of the Irish tax system   and Ireland is responsible for the amount of Irish corporation tax that is charged here.\u00a0 I want to re-emphasise that all companies operating in Ireland   domestic businesses and multinationals - are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities here. A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits, as well as certain petroleum, mining and land-dealing activities, and chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.<\/p><p>  There are different ways of measuring the effective rate of corporation tax and there is no single internationally agreed comparative measure for this.\u00a0   There are however a range of independent studies that show the effective rate in Ireland as being very close to the main headline rate of 12.5%.\u00a0 The European Commission's Taxation Trends in the EU 2013   indicates an effective corporation tax rate for Ireland of 14.4% per cent.\u00a0 The Price Waterhouse Coopers \/ World Bank 2014 report shows an effective rate of 12.3% for Ireland.\u00a0 I know that the assumptions being used in that latter study have been challenged and I am not claiming ownership of the figures but they are examples of the way that different methodologies can produce different results. In response to the growing interest in the subject, the Revenue Commissioners now publish an additional explanatory note with their annual Statistical Report.<\/p><p>  The 2012 Revenue Statistical Report (which refers to 2011 data) indicates that aggregate net taxable profits, after taking account of various deductions, allowances, charges and reliefs, amounted to &euro;40.1 billion while the total amount of corporation tax payable on these profits was &euro;4.2 billion. This means that total corporation tax payable as a percentage of taxable profits was approximately 10.5 per cent for 2011. While this percentage is lower than the 12&frac12; per cent rate, this can be attributed to the availability of certain reliefs   such as double taxation relief and the R&amp;amp;D credit for example. <\/p><p>  The issue of effective rates of corporate tax was discussed at length at Committee Stage of Finance No. 2 Bill 2013 last November.\u00a0 In view of the significant confusion around the issue, it was agreed that my Department would prepare a report on the matter to be presented to the Oireachtas Finance Committee by the end of Quarter 1 this year.  This report is currently being prepared and will likely be published upon completion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000053#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Insurance Cover","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000053#WRB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[8245\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000053#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in the event of insurance companies not providing flood cover to home owners and businesses where flood defences have been built with State funds, following a voluntary memorandum of understanding between the Office of Public Works and the insurance industry for the sharing of information regarding these defences, if he will introduce regulations or conditions on their operating licence by legislation or regulation through the Central Bank of Ireland to ensure homes can get cover; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I am also very conscious of the difficulties that the absence of such cover can cause to householders and businesses. While the lack of availability of flood insurance affects a relatively small number of people, the consequences for these people are serious should their house or commercial premises be damaged by flooding. However, neither I, as Minister, nor the Central Bank, have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals. <\/p><p>  The issue of provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting and the making of adequate provisioning to meet these risks. In some cases flood insurance is not economically viable for insurance companies and, in the interests of keeping premiums affordable for policyholders in general, insurers decline flood cover for new business for some risks, or, in certain cases, need to withdraw flood cover at renewal.  These are commercial decisions that insurers make having regard to the circumstances prevailing.<\/p><p>  My colleague, Minister of State Hayes at OPW has taken the lead role in discussions with the insurance industry about improving the provision of insurance cover in areas where remedial works are being carried out and OPW is near agreement on a data-sharing platform which will facilitate the transfer of detailed information on completed OPW flood relief schemes on an on-going basis. This will allow the insurance industry to take the flood protection measures into account when assessing flood risk in localities where such flood measures have been completed.  <\/p><p>  While the agreement on the memorandum of understanding with the insurance industry is to be welcomed as a first step, ultimately, it will be a matter for the insurance companies themselves to decide how they will use the information provided on completed flood defence works but they are committing to take the information into account in their assessment of risk and it is to be expected that this will facilitate the provision of flood cover in areas that are protected by completed schemes.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code sets out how the Central Bank requires insurance companies to treat consumers.  The Code obliges insurers to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and that they must act with skill and diligence in the best interests of customers.  The Code has a number of sections specifically dealing with insurance claims handling. The Central Bank of Ireland has no remit over the pricing of insurance products or the practices of insurers in relation to underwriting particular risks. Indeed the Central Bank, along with all E.U. Competent authorities is specifically restricted from doing so under the various European insurance directives.   <\/p><p>In cases where individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance believe that they are being treated unfairly, they can contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.

","asker":"1003","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>According to the consumer price index, private rents rose nationally by 6.0 per cent in 2013, following on from an increase of 2.5 per cent in 2012. However, this follows a fall of over 25 per cent between 2008 and late 2010. It is important to note that, on this basis, private rents are now at approximately the same level as they were in January 2003.<\/p><p>  The PRTB rental index, which provides a geographical breakdown of developments in the residential market, shows that monthly rent levels were up by 6.4 per cent on a mix-adjusted basis in Dublin in the year to Q3 2013. Rents outside the capital were down by 0.2 per cent over the same period. As a result, rents in Dublin stood 14.1 per cent below the levels seen in Q3 2007 (the beginning of the index), with rents outside Dublin down 23.4 per cent over the same period. <\/p><p>  As regards Real Estate Investment Trusts, I would like to highlight that potential benefits for property tenants were a motivating factor in the introduction of the REIT framework last year. REITs are specifically designed for the long-term holding of income-producing property.\u00a0 They are not designed to hold development activities, or to be a vehicle for short term speculative gains, and so can provide greater scope for stable, long-term tenancies.<\/p><p>  The first REIT launched in July 2013, and made its first property purchases in October 2013, so there has not as yet been sufficient time to determine the impact, if any, which REITs have had on rental prices in Ireland. To date the REITs that have launched have focused on the commercial sector. My officials will be monitoring the uptake of REITs in the Irish property market, but it is not expected that REIT ownership of property will reach the level of concentration at which a distortion of competition in the market may occur.<\/p><p>  As regards the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA is funding both unfinished housing units and new development. It is estimated that approximately 4,500 residential properties will be completed and available for sale or rent in Dublin over the 2014-16 period through NAMA debtors\/receivers or joint ventures involving NAMA.\u00a0 In addition, NAMA is funding the completion of existing and the development of new residential developments in the main urban areas to which it has an exposure.\u00a0 NAMA is working closely with the various local authorities in this respect.\u00a0 NAMA has indicated that in many instances, planning issues and other obstacles need to be resolved to facilitate the delivery of new residential supply.<\/p><p>  In summary, I wish to assure the deputy that my Department will continue to monitor developments in the property and rental markets. As set out in the Government's Medium Term Economic Strategy, the Government will continue to work on addressing remaining challenges in the property and construction sectors. This will include developing an overall strategic approach to housing supply, identifying and implementing further improvements in the planning process to facilitate appropriate development, and seeking to improve financing options for development and mortgage provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000053#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Debt Restructuring","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000053#WRB01750"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[8348\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000053#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of times he has formally raised the issue of the retrospective recapitalisation at the Eurogroup or ECOFIN meetings since September 2012.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":67,"content":"<p>As I have outlined in my replies to a number of previous Parliamentary Questions, the Euro-area Heads of State or Government (HoSG) agreed in June 2012 that &quot;it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns&quot;, and that when a Single Supervisory Mechanism, involving the ECB, is in place and operational, the European Stability Mechanism could recapitalise banks directly. <\/p><p>  Since September 2012, the issue of direct recapitalisation by the ESM has been on the Agenda of the Eurogroup on seven occasions (21st January 2013, 11th February 2013, 4th March 2013, 12<sup>th<\/sup> April 2013, 13<sup>th<\/sup>   May 2013, 20th June 2013 and 17th February 2014).

There is a specific provision included in those main features, which states that &quot;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.&quot; Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it. <\/p><p>  Finally, both I and my Government colleagues will ensure that Ireland's case for retrospective direct recapitalisation is made at all levels as appropriate.\u00a0 I remain confident that the commitment made by the Euro-area Heads of State or Government in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns will be respected. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000053#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":68,"content":"<p>Question No. 30 answered with Question No. 26.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Issues","counter":69,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000053#WRB02050"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[8381\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000053#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether the lack of competition in the banking sector is leading to increased fees and charge as well as greater use of cash in the domestic economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":71,"content":"<p>I\u00a0accept that the level of competition in the Irish banking sector has reduced as a result of the recent decisions by ACC and Danske Bank to withdraw, following the withdrawal of Bank of Scotland (Ireland) some time ago.   Over time, I expect that the restructuring of the banking sector and the recovery of the economy will present opportunities for the entry of new market participants well positioned to be confident in the future profitability of an Irish branch or subsidiary.\u00a0   \u00a0The Government continues to work to create an environment conducive to the entry of such new entrants through a number of initiatives and have led the debate at EU level on the mechanisms to promote alternative forms of financing for SMEs. <\/p><p>  \u00a0The Government has also taken steps to ensure that the Irish financial market is accessible to any financial institution considering establishing in Ireland. In seeking to reduce the barriers to entry which are specific to the Irish banking market, Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act (as amended), which provides for the regulation of bank fees and\u00a0commissions has been disapplied for three years in the case of new financial service providers setting up in Ireland.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware bank fees and charges are subject to regulation under Section 149.\u00a0This section came into effect in 1996 and currently requires that credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make an\u00a0application to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce\u00a0 new customer charges or increase any existing customer charges in respect of certain services. Section 149 does not cover interest rates; it applies to fees and\u00a0commissions \u00a0only. <\/p><p>  My Department recently published a\u00a0review of the regulation of bank fees and charges which is available on its website . The review concluded that it would not be appropriate to repeal section 149 at this time. The lack of competition in the banking sector means that the removal of section 149 would give unfettered price setting power to the incumbent banks.\u00a0\u00a0However, the report recommended that the \u00a0issue should be revisited when competition in the banking sector has improved significantly.\u00a0 It is my view that the current regulatory regime offers appropriate protection to consumers against unjustified\u00a0increases in bank fees and commissions.<\/p><p>  \u00a0It is true that Ireland continues to rely heavily on cash and other paper payment instruments. This has significant implications for cost competitiveness, security and consumer choice in Ireland.

The Deputy will be aware of eDay which is on 19 September 2014. The announcement of eDay was made by Minister of State Brian Hayes last September so as to give Government Departments, Local Authorities and other state agencies sufficient time to prepare for it. eDay is the day from which these authorities will no longer accept cash or cheques from businesses or make payment to businesses by way of cheques.

","asker":"1052","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":94,"content":"<p>The Revenue Commissioners are charged with responsibility for collection and recovery of a wide range of taxes and duties. I know that Revenue has a strong focus on making sure that everyone complies with their tax and duty responsibilities by paying the right amount and on time. Revenue expects businesses to continue, notwithstanding the difficult economic circumstances in which they are now operating, to maintain a clear focus and organise their financial affairs to ensure that tax debts are paid as they fall due. I know that Revenue is conscious of the difficult economic and financial climate and how it impacts on business in being timely compliant. For example, Revenue has actively encouraged businesses experiencing particular payment difficulties to work proactively with them when such difficulties start to arise to find an agreed way through the difficulties and quickly restore voluntary timely compliance.<\/p><p>  As I have advised the Deputy in reply to previous questions on this issue, I am informed by Revenue that Sheriffs are officers of the Court, holding office under Section 12 of the Court Officers Act, 1945. Their debt collection activities are generally covered by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, as amended and the execution of Revenue certificates is specifically provided for in Section 960L of the Taxes Consolidated Act 1997, as amended. Once a certificate relating to an unpaid tax debt has been issued to a Sheriff, the taxpayer becomes liable for payment of the associated Sheriff's fees and costs. The current fee structure came into effect on 1 November 2005 and is set out in the Sheriffs Fees and Expenses Order, 2005. When acting in execution of tax certificates, Sheriffs are governed by the general law, which applies to the collection of civil debts of all kinds, and not by the provisions of the Tax Acts. They are not accountable to Revenue as regards the methods and techniques of enforcement but are answerable before the courts for any breach of the civil debt collection law.\u00a0 Accordingly the data requested by the Deputy is not available to Revenue or to my Department.\u00a0 I am advised however that Revenue understands that Sheriffs only undertake seizures in a very small minority of cases and only after the defaulting taxpayer has not complied with requests for payment.<\/p><p>  Sheriffs remit all monies, after deduction of their fees and expenses, collected from taxpayers in respect of the certificates issued to them to Revenue for appropriation against the taxpayers' accounts and transfer to the Exchequer. A table is included at Appendix 1 showing the details of the numbers, values and amounts collected in respect of certificates issued to Sheriffs in each of the last five years.<\/p><p>  Again as I have previously informed the Deputy, I understand that the Sheriffs operate a Code of Practice, available from any Sheriff or on Revenue's website, which sets out how Sheriffs will engage with taxpayers in relation to their tax collection enforcement activities. For example, it includes commitments that when goods are seized a written inventory will be supplied to the taxpayer as soon as possible, and there is a commitment to furnish the taxpayer with an account of the proceeds of the sale of any goods seized. The Code also sets out the process whereby a taxpayer may make a complaint and how it will be handled.<\/p><p>  Finally, I am satisfied that the Sheriff operation continues to make a very significant contribution to the overall effectiveness of Revenue's collection enforcement programmes.<\/p><p>  Appendix 1<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>No. of Certificates Issued by Revenue to Sheriffs<\/th><th>Value of Certificates(m)<\/th><th>Tax \/ Interest Collected(m)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>38,790<\/td><td>&euro;697.4<\/td><td>&euro;214.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>32,964<\/td><td>&euro;529.0<\/td><td>&euro;173.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>34,466<\/td><td>&euro;474.3<\/td><td>&euro;172.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>31,065<\/td><td>&euro;373.6<\/td><td>&euro;151.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>28,795<\/td><td>&euro;312.0<\/td><td>&euro;150.2<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000054#WRC00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Debt Restructuring","counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000054#WRC00850"},{"type":"question","counter":96,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[8380\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000054#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the European Commission will deliver its response to the restructuring proposals for Permanent TSB; the progress that has been made to date in ensuring Permanent TSB plays a positive role in the Irish banking market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":97,"content":"<p>A way forward for Permanent TSB was agreed with the Troika in April 2012 which envisaged it playing an important role in the future of Irish retail banking, being a more focused retail bank bringing an element of competition to the marketplace which has consolidated significantly since 2008.\u00a0 In this regard Permanent TSB prepared a Restructuring Plan, which the Department of Finance submitted to the European Commission (\"the Commission\") in June 2012.<\/p><p>  As requested by the Commission an updated version of the plan was submitted in\u00a0 August 2013 which is broadly in line with the June 2012 plan.\u00a0Discussions are ongoing at a technical level involving the Commission, the Department of Finance and Permanent TSB in relation to the plan.

Under these provisions fuel purchased other than in bulk or through an approved fuel card is not covered by the scheme.<\/p><p>  Purchases in bulk by the qualifying transport operator must be made from a licensed mineral oil trader, and be delivered, in a quantity exceeding 2,000 litres, to a premises or place that is under the control of that road transport operator. Purchases by means of a fuel card, approved by Revenue for that purpose, may also qualify for repayment and there is no minimum requirement on purchases made in this way.\u00a0 A fuel card will be approved where Revenue is satisfied that the fuel card provider will supply it electronically with information about purchases of auto-diesel by means of that card and subsequently claimed under the scheme. There are a number of fuel card providers who can supply suitable fuel cards to road transport operators and fuel retailers.<\/p><p>  As part of the risk control measures under the scheme, claimants must register for and claim repayments electronically through Revenue's on-line system (ROS). This enables Revenue to take advantage of third party information to verify claims automatically. Bulk claims are verified against the monthly returns submitted by licensed mineral oil traders to Revenue under the supply chain controls introduced to tackle fuel laundering. This return shows information on all fuel transactions by the mineral oil trader during the month greater than 2000 litres, including such transactions with the qualifying transport operators. Claims for fuel purchased by way of a fuel card can be verified against the information supplied to Revenue by the fuel card provider. In addition to third party verification of claims, these arrangements allow Revenue to carry out extensive data analysis to identify suspicious claims and transactions, another aspect of Revenue's risk control framework.<\/p><p>  The scheme provides for repayments of mineral oil tax under specific conditions that do not apply to the very different requirements of input credit under the VAT system. \u00a0Claims made on the basis of VAT receipts would be costly to administer and would not provide sufficient assurance against the risk of fraudulent claims. In the first instance, claims would not be verifiable, automatically and in real time, against third party data from the fuel card providers and mineral oil traders. Instead, Revenue would be obliged to check such claims manually and these checks would be highly resource-intensive, necessarily limited, and cause lengthy delays in processing legitimate claims. I believe that the current arrangements find the right balance between facilitating compliant transport operators and controlling the risk of fraud.<\/p><p>  The requirements of the scheme, including those relating to fuel purchases, were explained at length during meetings between Revenue and representative bodies of the transport operators prior to its commencement.\u00a0 Detailed information on the application of the scheme is published on .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000054#WRC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Insurance Cover","counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000054#WRC01250"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[8382\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000054#WRC01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in view of his comments the insurance industry must cope with flood insurance, his views on whether the industry is sufficiently prepared to cope with challenges associated with flooding and subsidence issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

When the review is complete,\u00a0I will examine it and will report to Cabinet on what measures, if any, are needed to improve the availability of flood insurance cover.<\/p><p>  The Deputy\u00a0refers to\u00a0the scheme proposed by the National Flood Forum.\u00a0\u00a0I am aware that the Flood Forum gave a presentation to the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on the issue of property insurance in March 2013.\u00a0 These proposals will be considered as part of the flooding insurance\u00a0review.<\/p><p>  The Deputy\u00a0also refers to a reinsurance scheme whereby insurance companies could pool their flood insurance liabilities, similar to the temporary scheme in the UK known as Flood Re.\u00a0 However, the\u00a0introduction of such a scheme would likely lead to a significant increase in household insurance premiums as those in low risk areas would be required to subsidise those in high risk areas.\u00a0 Furthermore, the Exchequer would also be required to provide financial assistance to such a scheme in circumstances where the claims were above the level of funds in the pool.\u00a0 I am continuing to monitor how the difficulties around the Flood Re scheme are being addressed in the UK.<\/p><p>  In cases where individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance believe that they are being treated unfairly, they can contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. Their service can be contacted at (01) 676 1914 or by email at\u00a0.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000054#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000054#WRC01700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000054#WRC01650"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[8745\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000054#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has appointed an information officer, if this person is in charge of developing and implementing data protection in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The best way to effectively address this issue is for countries to work together at the international level and the appropriate action is being considered in this regard by the OECD as part of their project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and Ireland is participating fully in this process.<\/p><p>  The second issue is the effective rate of tax applying in individual countries.\u00a0 Clearly, the domestic rate of tax paid in Ireland is within the control of the Irish tax system   and Ireland is responsible for the amount of Irish corporation tax that is charged here.\u00a0 I want to reemphasise that all companies operating in Ireland   domestic businesses and multinationals - are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities here. A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits, as well as certain petroleum, mining and land-dealing activities, and chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.<\/p><p>  There are different ways of measuring the effective rate of corporation tax and there is no single internationally agreed comparative measure for this.<\/p><p>  There are however a range of independent studies that show the effective rate in Ireland as being very close to the main headline rate of 12.5%.\u00a0 The European Commission's Taxation Trends in the EU 2013 indicates an effective corporation tax rate for Ireland of 14.4% per cent.\u00a0 The Price Waterhouse Coopers \/ World Bank 2014 report shows an effective rate of 12.3% for Ireland.\u00a0 I know that the assumptions being used in that latter study have been challenged and I am not claiming ownership of the figures but they are examples of the way that different methodologies can produce different results.In response to the growing interest in the subject, the Revenue Commissioners now publish an additional explanatory note with their annual Statistical Report.<\/p><p>  The 2012 Revenue Statistical Report (which refers to 2011 data) indicates that aggregate net taxable profits, after taking account of various deductions, allowances, charges and reliefs, amounted to &euro;40.1 billion while the total amount of corporation tax payable on these profits was &euro;4.2 billion. This means that total corporation tax payable as a percentage of taxable profits was approximately 10.5 per cent for 2011.<\/p><p>  While this percentage is lower than the 12&frac12; per cent rate, this can be attributed to the availability of certain reliefs such as double taxation relief and the R&amp;amp;D credit for example.<\/p><p>  The issue of effective rates of corporate tax was discussed at length at Committee Stage of Finance No. 2 Bill 2013 last November.\u00a0 In view of the significant confusion around the issue, it was agreed that my Department would prepare a report on the matter to be presented to the Oireachtas Finance Committee by the end of Quarter 1 this year.<\/p><p>  This report is currently being prepared and will likely be published upon completion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000055#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Laundering","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000055#WRD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[8611\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000055#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Number 169 of 11 February 2014, his views on correspondence (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Revenue and HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs (HMRC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding in May 2012 on a joint approach to finding a more effective marker for use in both jurisdictions.

These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.\u00a0 Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution that will support follow-up enforcement action where necessary;<\/p><p>  - An intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations; and<\/p><p>  - following a joint process, Revenue and HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs in the UK have identified a new product to mark rebated fuels in a move that will boost the fight against illegal fuel laundering in both jurisdictions.<\/p><p>  Revenue also works with fuel sector representative bodies, which have been very supportive of the range of measures introduced to combat fuel laundering, to improve the integrity of the distribution system and minimise the risk of fraud. In support of this, I introduced a provision in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that will make a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty evaded. This new provision will strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying fuel recklessly to dubious customers.\u00a0 Revenue has recently published guidelines for mineral oil traders which will assist them in identifying and avoiding such transactions.\u00a0\u00a0Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group and has established regional sub-groups to facilitate traders reporting suspicious matters through their representative associations on a confidential basis.\u00a0 This information can assist Revenue in closing down the illicit trade by identifying traders supplying fuel to launderers and by identifying outlets that are selling laundered diesel.\u00a0\u00a0Revenue's enforcement strategy in the fuel sector has already yielded significant results.\u00a0 In the period from mid-2011 to end January 2014, 123 filling stations were closed for breaches of licensing conditions.\u00a0 Since the beginning of 2011, over 2.7 million litres of fuel have been seized and 29 oil laundries detected and closed down, including 9 oil laundries in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000055#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Cost","counter":132,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000055#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":133,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[8713\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000055#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to review capital gains tax reliefs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":134,"content":"<p>I have no plans at this time to carry out a general review of existing capital gains tax reliefs.<\/p><p>  In recognition of the economic climate in recent years I and previous Ministers for Finance have sought to obtain an additional contribution from capital gains tax by increasing the rate as follows:<\/p><p>Disposals made: from 6 December 2012 onwards\u00a0- 33%, from 7 December 2011 to 5 December 2012\u00a0 - 30%, from 8 April 2009 to 6 December 2011 - 25%, from 15 October 2008 to 7 April 2009\u00a0\u00a0- 22%,\u00a0 on or before 14 October 2008\u00a0- 20%.<\/p><p>  \u00a0Capital gains tax is one of a suite of taxes that plays an important role in the overall taxation system in place in Ireland. In terms of equity, it is appropriate that those who make capital gains should make a contribution in tax terms so that the entire tax burden does not only significantly fall on those who pay income taxes. Capital gains tax also plays a role in mitigating opportunities for tax avoidance by discouraging the conversion of income into capital gains to reduce tax liability.<\/p><p>  Reliefs play an important role in relation to most taxes and capital gains tax is no different in this regard. Targeted business related capital gains tax reliefs are provided principally to ensure that business, while paying its share of capital gains tax, is not unduly hampered in terms of developing and growing its business or in passing on businesses to the next generation of business people.<\/p><p>  The following capital gains tax reliefs are all geared towards assisting business:<\/p><p>  - Appropriation to and from stock in trade (section 596 Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997)<\/p><p>  - Entrepreneur relief (section 597A TCA 1997) (subject to a commencement order due to requirement for EU State Aid approval)<\/p><p>  - Retirement relief (sections 598\/599 TCA 1997)<\/p><p>  - Transfer of business to a company (section 600 TCA 1997)<\/p><p>  - Replacement of Qualifying Premises ( certain rented residential premises (section 600A, TCA 1997) [now only available in limited circumstances]<\/p><p>  - Relief for farm restructuring (section 604B TCA 1997<\/p><p>  - Disposals to authority possessing compulsory powers (section 605 TCA 1997)<\/p><p>  - Transfer of assets on company reconstructions or amalgamation (section 615 TCA 1997<\/p><p>  - Reliefs in relation to inter-group company transactions (sections 617 et seq.).<\/p><p>  \u00a0All reliefs are reviewed periodically and maintained, adjusted or abolished by reference to the circumstances that exist at the time relative to those that gave rise to their introduction.<\/p><p>  Take Roll-over relief (Section 597), for example. Roll-over relief was introduced in 1975 when capital gains tax was first enacted. It allowed chargeable gains on disposals of business assets to be deferred provided the proceeds of disposal were reinvested in new business assets.\u00a0 This relief was reviewed and was removed in Finance Act 2003 from 4 December 2002 onwards, except in the case of eligible taxpayers who had rolled-over assets prior to that date. The abolition of rollover relief in late 2002 must be seen in the context of the introduction at that time of the single 12.5% rate of corporation tax on trading profits.<\/p><p>  Another example of a business relief that was reviewed and amended is the capital gains tax farm retirement relief which was amended in Finance (No 2) Act 2013. This was extended to allow relief to a farmer who farmed for 10 years, has no children to whom to pass on the land, and who lets the farm for a period following retirement from active farming before ultimately disposing of the land. Prior to this such a farmer would not have been entitled to retirement relief.<\/p><p>  Certain reliefs are introduced from time to time with a view to achieving a particular objective in particular circumstances.<\/p><p>  Examples of such reliefs include:<\/p><p>  - Relief for certain disposals of land and buildings (section 604A TCA 1997 - introduced by section 64, Finance Act 2012). This short-term relief was introduced to provide a stimulus to the property market at a time when there was virtually no activity in it. The intention being that the impact would be both direct (on estate agents, surveyors, etc) and indirect (on construction related activities) as well as encouraging the sale of commercial premises and long term investment in productive assets, thereby assisting in the creation of longer term employment. This is a targeted relief   it only applies to certain land and buildings acquired during the period 7 December 2011 to 31 December 2014. Any such property acquired must be held for 7 years in order to qualify for full relief. Any disposal within the 7 year period gets no relief.<\/p><p>  - Relief for farm restructuring (section 604B TCA 1997 introduced by section 48, Finance Act 2013). This relief was identified as desirable to assist farmers to become more viable by enabling them to restructure their land holdings without incurring a capital gains tax.\u00a0 This relief is a more focused form of relief than the more general roll-over relief that was in the main abolished from 4 December 2002.<\/p><p>  - Entrepreneur relief (section 597A TCA 1997 introduced by section 45 Finance (No. 2) Act 2013). This is a CGT relief for individuals who reinvest the proceeds of previous asset disposals into new business ventures. The commencement of this relief is subject to EU State Aid approval.Lastly, I announced in my Budget 2014 speech, in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, that I would commission a review of tax reliefs available to farming. This review will include CGT reliefs available to farming. Any recommendations of the review will be considered in the context of Budget 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000055#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000055#WRD02600"},{"type":"question","counter":136,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[8744\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000055#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has established an information officer, if this person is in charge of developing and implementing data protection in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":137,"content":"<p>Under the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, my Department as both a data controller and data processor has registered its details with the Data Protection Commissioner.

I have however, introduced an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative. The additional levy, within the existing legal framework, will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015. <\/p><p>  The impact of the Jobs Initiative can be seen by the increase in employment levels, particularly in the accommodation and food services sector. The Jobs Initiative included the reduction of VAT on tourism services to 9% from 13.5% on a temporary basis until the end of 2013. This measure has proved to be a major success, helping create over 15,000 new jobs as well as protecting existing jobs. It was due to end in 2013. However, it is important that we reinforce success when possible, so I have decided to continue this reduced rate. This will support the increased number of jobs already in place and accelerate the creation of new jobs.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I announced the reduction of the Air Travel Tax to zero with effect from 1st April 2014. The decision to remove the tax, together with the retention of the 9% VAT rate for tourism services, will help maintain the momentum created by the success of The Gathering this year. Since the Budget announcement, airlines have announced the opening up of new routes resulting in a significant increase in passenger numbers with the associated increase in tourism activity and employment.<\/p><p>  The Jobs Initiative also included a number of current and capital expenditure measures, including a number aimed at retraining the workforce. I would ask the Deputy to note that my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton T.D., with responsibility for JobBridge, the National Internship scheme, recently announced that the number of internships, originally planned at 5,000 has now exceeded 20,000. Indecon Economic Consultants undertook an evaluation of the JobBridge scheme in 2012 (published in April 2013) and their report found that 61.4% of the JobBridge survey respondents were in employment within 5 months of finishing their internships.<\/p><p>  Under education measures, the Springboard scheme as announced in the Jobs Initiative had initially provided for 5,900 places. During 2011 and 2012, over 10,000 people enrolled on programmes under the Springboard scheme. The scheme has been extended further with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Ruair&iacute; Quinn T.D. announcing in June this year, another 6,000 places under the third Springboard allocation. Further rollouts of the springboard scheme will be considered in the context of the findings of an on-going evaluation. <\/p><p>  The chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. I cannot intervene in this process in respect of any pension fund.<\/p><p>  However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy. <\/p><p>  Finally, I want to reiterate that addressing the difficulties in the labour market remains the Government's biggest challenge and, accordingly, the Government is giving its highest priority to job protection and job creation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000056#WRE00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Administration","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000056#WRE00350"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[8769\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000056#WRE00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if information was exchanged between State agencies, semi State bodies and the Revenue Commissioners in preparation for the local property tax; the checks put in place to protect the data; if the transfer was referred to the data protection commissioner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Sections 151 and 153 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) enable the Revenue Commissioners to request certain details from specified bodies for LPT purposes. Section 153 of the Act includes a list of these bodies. <\/p><p>  Under section 151 of the Act, the information that the Revenue Commissioners may request is details, in the possession or control of the relevant person, of the address or addresses, as the case may be, of residential properties, and in relation to each residential property:<\/p><p>  - the name of the occupier,<\/p><p>  - the name of the owner,<\/p><p>  - the address contained in any geodirectory maintained by any relevant person or such other information as may allow the location of the property to be established,<\/p><p>  - any unique identification number which the relevant person has assigned to the property or, as the case may be, to any meter or other device located in the property or to the occupier or owner of that property, and<\/p><p>  - information in relation to the size and type of the property.\u00a0<\/p><p>  As there is a legislative basis for the sharing of the specified information by these bodies with the Revenue Commissioners, it is permitted from a data protection perspective under section 8(e) of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.\u00a0 However, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is routinely consulted in relation to proposed data exchanges between State Bodies and Revenue and did provide guidance in relation to aspects of the data which was transferred to Revenue for the purposes of implementing Local Property Tax.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A key aspect of the work undertaken by Revenue in the implementation of LPT was the development of a comprehensive Register of residential properties in the State. The Register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue's own databases, the Household Charge database from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), Non-Principal Private Residence data, Private Residential Tenancies Board data, information from the Department of Social Protection and data from utility companies.\u00a0 As well as being provided for in the LPT legislation, in advance of the data exchanges, data protocol agreements were drawn up between Revenue and the relevant organisations. These outlined how the data would be transmitted and how it would be secured and managed by Revenue.\u00a0\u00a0I am also advised that the Commissioners utilised the following data sources in their development of the on-line interactive valuation guide, most of which are publically available:<\/p><p>  - Revenue's stamp duty records, which record all property sales in the Republic and the values of the properties sold.<\/p><p>  - CSO's Residential Property Price Index which provides guidance on establishing the percentage reduction to be applied to the prices obtained for properties sold in 2010, 2011 or 2012.<\/p><p>  - The Geo-Directory produced by Ordnance Survey Ireland and An Post, which provides information on property location and type.<\/p><p>  - Information in relation to property location and type collected by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.<\/p><p>  - Spatially derived data that indicate relative distances of all residential properties (using GeoDirectory) to a series of key amenities and services (transport, health, education, retail, emergency services etc).<\/p><p>  - Geographically linked data from publicly available sources such as the Central Statistic Office Census 2011 results at small area level and the 2012 Pobal HP Deprivation index. <\/p><p>  \u00a0Revenue is an integrated tax and customs organisation. Frontline customer service, compliance and debt management staff throughout the organisation, amounting to about 4,800 at clerical, administrative and management grades, who are authorised to do so, have access to taxpayer records, including LPT, to enable them to do their jobs.\u00a0\u00a0 I am advised that access to data by Revenue staff is based on a management approved business case. Access controls are in place for staff using all Revenue taxpayer systems.\u00a0 All access is recorded and regular audits are carried out to ensure access policies are followed. The Deputy should note that this number fluctuates as a result of staff movements and changing business needs.<\/p><p>  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that taxpayer confidence in Revenue is essential for the organisation to fulfil its duties as laid down by the Houses of the Oireachtas and it is Revenue's reputation for properly and securely holding and using data that has nurtured and sustained that confidence.\u00a0 This principle of taxpayer confidentiality has always been central to the ethos of the organisation. The Finance Act 2011 introduced a taxpayer confidentiality provision which reinforced the existing ethos by providing the clear legal basis which allows Revenue officials to disclose taxpayer information and includes legal sanctions where this provision is breached. It has been hugely influential in encouraging staff to be more vigilant, thus further strengthening data protection in the organisation. <\/p><p>  The security and privacy of Revenue taxpayer data are of the highest priority and Revenue implements a host of different procedures and policies to protect this data.\u00a0 Revenue has a number of policies and practices in place to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of taxpayer data.<\/p><p> - Revenue has a Data Controller appointed by the Board pursuant to Section 1 of the Data Protection Acts who has overall responsibility for driving data protection policy and management.<\/p><p>  - A code of practice for the protection of personal data in Revenue was introduced in January of 2013 which was developed in conjunction with the office of the Data Protection Commissioner and is designed to give operational meaning to the principles of data protection set out in the Data Protection Acts.<\/p><p>  - Following on the Code of Practice, a consolidated Data Breach Management Plan has also been introduced which places the responsibility on senior management to report breaches to the Data Controller and which are logged in a data breach register which the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner may access.\u00a0<\/p><p>  Data protection policies and practices in Revenue have been examined on a number of occasions by the Data Protection Commissioner. His report of the substantial cross-organisation audit in 2010 was positive and Revenue has subsequently built on some of the recommendations in that report.All Revenue officials are bound by the Officials Secrets Acts, the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour, the Revenue Code of Ethics, in addition to Section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, which introduced criminal sanctions for unauthorised disclosure of taxpayer information.\u00a0Revenue has a range of internal controls to ensure compliance. Internal data protection audits were introduced in 2010 which examine compliance with the Data Protection Acts in district and regional offices. New measures were introduced to assure staff compliance with Revenue policy on data security and confidentiality. This facilitates periodic review of staff access logs to ensure compliance with access and transaction processing rules.Revenue has attained and maintained ISO27001 since January 2010 accreditation.\u00a0 This covers information\/data security for the public facing systems (www.revenue.ie and www.ros.ie).\u00a0 ISO27001 is the international best practice standard for information security and is independently audited by external practitioners.\u00a0 For Revenue this includes all live application software, network, security, server, operating systems, middleware, data, storage and the monitoring components within these zones.\u00a0 Revenue systems\/processes were last audited in November 2013.\u00a0 Revenue also holds ISO 22301 for their Data Centres, which is the international standard for business continuity management. The ISO 22301 management system lets you identify threats relevant to your business and the critical business functions they could impact. It requires Revenue to have plans in place ahead of time to ensure business continuity.Finally, I am advised that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is routinely consulted in relation to all proposed data exchanges between State Bodies and Revenue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000056#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000056#WRE00750"},{"type":"question","counter":148,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[8773\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000056#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a refund of income tax paid is due in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Carlow in view of the fact that they have not yet received their tax clearance certificate sent on 16 December 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The resumption of economic growth reflects the improvement in our competitiveness that we have seen in recent years and is indicative of a very flexible economy.\u00a0 But we are also seeing a moderate recovery in domestic demand, suggesting that some of the imbalances built up during the bubble years are being corrected.<\/p><p>  My Department estimates that GDP rose by 0.2 per cent last year; this compares with an average decline of 0.4 per cent across the\u00a0euro area.\u00a0However, developments in euro area trading partners have been relatively encouraging since the middle of last year, with the euro area returning to growth after several quarters of contraction.<\/p><p>  I am particularly encouraged by recent developments in\u00a0our labour market. The unemployment rate, although still unacceptably high, has declined by\u00a0nearly\u00a03 percentage points in under two years to 12.3 per cent in January.\u00a0Supporting this reduction in the unemployment rate has been\u00a0a resumption of strong employment growth, with employment increasing by 3.2 per cent (58,000 jobs) over the year to the third quarter of last year, the highest year-on-year rate of\u00a0growth\u00a0in the entire EU according to Eurostat figures.<\/p><p>  Although developments in Ireland of late have been encouraging, it is of course worth noting that we do not move in isolation.\u00a0A recovery in our\u00a0European partners\u00a0is\u00a0vital if we are to continue the recent positive momentum we have seen in Ireland and\u00a0achieve\u00a0sustained growth over the medium term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000057#WRF01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fiscal Policy","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000057#WRF01250"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[8813\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000057#WRF01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which it might be found possible to establish a Government development bond to generate the necessary resources to meet the demands of the housing crisis without affecting balance sheet requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

All monies raised through Government borrowing are paid into the Central Fund\u00a0and used to fund Government spending as approved by the Oireachtas. It has never been the custom to\u00a0 link borrowing to specific projects as to do so would limit the flexibility of the Government in managing the State's finances.<\/p><p>  There are a number of options available to individuals who wish to help support the Government's work in promoting economic growth and employment.  The National Solidarity Bonds were introduced to provide a wider range of options for retail investors. The Minister for Finance in announcing Budget 2010 launched the 10-year National Solidarity Bond, the purpose of which was to allow citizens an opportunity to invest and provide money to the State to stimulate economic recovery and to assist in the maintenance and creation of employment.

It also recognises that businesses with legacy debts may be viable. One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.  As the Deputy is aware, the Irish Credit Bureau is a private entity and I have no direct function in the day-to-day operational decisions. In relation to the credit ratings provided to SMEs my Department recognised the need to reorganise the Government reporting system and established an inter-agency working group at the end of 2010 to develop a strategy to put in place an effective credit reporting system in Ireland.\u00a0 The working group's report formed the basis of the Credit Reporting Act 2013.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Credit Reporting Act 2013 provides for the creation of an effective statutory based credit reporting system.\u00a0 The Bill includes the following provisions:<\/p><p>  - The database will be owned by the Central Bank and the Bank will be responsible for the operation of the Central Credit Register. <\/p><p>  - There will be mandatory reporting of a comprehensive range of credit information by credit providers. <\/p><p>  - The Bill provides for controls with regard to access to information on the Register. By including provisions relating to access to data and security measures as well as provisions to help to deal with identity theft, this legislation should inspire confidence in businesses and in the consumer.<\/p><p>  - The legislation proposes to extend the role of the Data Protection Commissioner to deal with complaints from micro enterprises and SMEs (with a turnover of less than &euro;3m) in respect of their data held on the Credit Register. This initiative may provide some comfort to enterprises where they have a concern in relation to the potential storing of inaccurate data and where they do not have the resources to take legal action through the Courts to seek to have the data corrected. Inaccurate data on the Central Credit Register could result in the refusal of credit to a small company.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  - In line with International practice, it provides for a retention period of 5 years in relation to credit information with respect to debts from the day on which it is entered on the Register. The Bill provides for the retention of information for a period of 6 months in relation to credit applications from the day it is entered on the Register. Anonymised information may be retained indefinitely.In addition, the Government is fully engaged in supporting the SME sector and has imposed SME lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved the targets for 2011 and 2012.\u00a0 I am informed that both banks sanctioned circa &euro;4bn in lending in 2013.In June 2013 the Central Bank set quarterly institution-specific performance targets for covered banks to move distressed SME borrowers onto longer-term solutions.\u00a0 The targets set reflect the banks' capacity, processes and systems.\u00a0\u00a0I should stress that the Credit Review process remains available to any SMEs whose credit has been reduced or withdrawn by AIB or Bank of Ireland as well as when credit is refused by them.

On that basis, the Commission recommended that the relief should be continued but on a more limited basis.

Making exceptions in the circumstances outlined in the question, will inevitably give rise to demands for exceptions to be granted in other situations that would be viewed by those seeking them as being equally deserving.

JobPath will be delivered by private\/third party providers of employment services under contract to the Department.  JobPath will augment and complement the Department&rsquo;s existing employment service capacity as well as that of the Local Employment Service (LES) and Job Clubs, which already operate under contract to the Department, thereby increasing capacity to provide supports to assist jobseekers in obtaining employment. The contracting approach offers the State a number of advantages not least of which are that contractors will have to bear the initial investment costs of the new service and contracting is flexible in responding to changes in service needs. <\/p><p>  On 1 July 2013, the Department published a Prior Information Notice (PIN) in which it notified the market that it was considering the potential of contracting private\/third party providers of employment services. A PIN is a discretionary and exploratory first step in a procurement process.  A consultation process was initiated whereby the Department held two information sessions in late July 2013 at which it outlined its thinking in relation to JobPath and invited responses. These events were attended by over 200 individuals representing a wide range of organisations involved in labour market activation including LES representatives. The Department also set up a dedicated email address to facilitate questions and feedback. A full list of the attendees and a question and answer document were published on the Department&rsquo;s website (). On 7 November 2013, Enterprise Ireland hosted a capacity building and networking event for interested parties of JobPath. This event was also attended by LES representatives.<\/p><p>  On 12 December 2013, the Department published a contract notice inviting tenders for the provision of JobPath services. The closing date for receipt of JobPath tenders is 28 February 2014. Tender documentation has been published on   while information on JobPath is available on   . LES providers are free to participate in the JobPath procurement process. <\/p><p>  The cost of the JobPath service is dependent upon the price agreed following the tendering process. JobPath is a payment by results model and as such the cost of JobPath is also dependent upon the number of individuals that JobPath providers place into sustained employment.<\/p><p>  JobPath contractors have not yet been appointed. It is not necessarily the case that contracts will be exclusively with large private companies. Many of the larger companies involved in this activity in other states are not-for-profit and\/or voluntary\/community companies.

These processing times improved in 2013 to 27.6 weeks for a summary decision and 34.4 weeks for an oral hearing.<\/p><p>  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009 the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum, whereas in 2012 the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013.<\/p><p>  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.  A major programme of process redesign and modernisation is also underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.<\/p><p>  In addition to the improvements in processing times mentioned above, these measures have also led to a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised in the appeals office from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress has also been made in reducing the number of appeals on hands from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 14,510 at 17 February 2014.<\/p><p>  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystallises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.<\/p><p>  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p><p><b>Domiciliary Care Allowance Appeals 2012 and 2013<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Appeals Registered<\/th><th>Appeals Allowed<\/th><th>Appeals Partially Allowed<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>2,186<\/td><td>874<\/td><td>29<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>1,688<\/td><td>783<\/td><td>25<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000064#WRN01800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":365,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000065#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":366,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[8750\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000065#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she has established an information officer, if this person is in charge of developing and implementing data protection in his Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":367,"content":"<p>My Department has a designated Head of Information at Principal Officer level.

There are over 14,000 registered boat owners on the seven waterways managed by Waterways Ireland.  These seven waterways make a vital contribution to tourism, attracting visitors from around Ireland and from abroad.  The proposed bye-laws are intended to support the investment already made by Waterways Ireland in new infrastructure and facilities along the canals.  That investment has made the waterways more attractive for boat owners and is helping to develop them as a vibrant recreational and tourist amenity for all waterway users.  Given that background, it is now necessary to update the bye-laws to ensure that the rules governing use of the waterways are fit for purpose and best meet the needs of all waterway users. <\/p><p>  The proposed new bye-laws provide for the management of house boats, defined as a boat on the canals which is being used as the sole or principal residence of the owner or an occupant with the owner's permission, as well as for extended moorings and residential moorings.  An Annual Houseboat Mooring Permit will be required for a houseboat not navigating or continuously cruising the canals.  The permit will allow the use of a mooring identified by Waterways Ireland on the canals where the houseboat may moor for more than five days and up to one year.  It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the total number of boat owners who will be required to take out an Annual Houseboat Mooring Permit in the event of the draft bye-laws coming into force.  However, I am advised that Waterways Ireland issued 276 Combined Mooring and Passage permits in 2013 for boats to navigate on the Grand and Royal Canals.  In addition, 151 Extended Mooring Permits have been issued to boat owners wishing to occupy dedicated berths on these navigations. <\/p><p>  The proposed bye-laws will also modernise the charging regime. There will also be further provision for the care, management, maintenance and control and the regulation of the use of the canals, moorings on the canals, and their use by the public for recreation and navigation purposes.<\/p><p>  I am aware of and appreciate that concerns have been raised regarding the proposed byelaws.  Waterways Ireland undertook a public consultation on the draft bye-laws referred to, which concluded on the 3rd February last.  I am advised that Waterways Ireland is currently in the process of carrying out an analysis of all submissions on the draft bye-laws received during the consultation process.  Once the analysis has been completed, all submissions will be given due consideration by Waterways Ireland and a report on the outcome of the process will be prepared.  The report will be forwarded to my Department and will then be referred to me, with recommendations for consideration and final decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000066#WRP00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":404,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000066#WRP00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":403,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000066#WRP00850"},{"type":"question","counter":404,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[8740\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000066#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he has appointed an information officer; if this person is in charge of developing and implementing data protection in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Where a person ceases to be a member before age 50, whether voluntarily or as a result of failure to be re-elected, the gratuity will be paid when the person reaches age 50 and will be based on the representational payment applicable at that point.  The Local Authority Members (Gratuity) (Amendment) Regulations 2006 provide for the gratuity to be paid before age 50 where retirement is due to permanent infirmity or where the member dies in office.  The amount of the gratuity is calculated on the basis of 4\/20ths of a Councillor&rsquo;s Representational Payment for each year of service from 4 May 2000, subject to a maximum twenty years&rsquo; service (i.e. four times the amount of the Representational Payment at the time of retirement).<\/p><p>  An additional ex-gratia payment may be made to Councillors serving on or after the date of the making of the 2006 Regulations in respect of service before 4 May 2000.  The rates to be applied are dependent on the number of years&rsquo; service and the category of local authority in which the Councillor served.  Circular Letter S.3\/2007 of 22 January 2007, issued by my Department, set the rate of payment of the ex-gratia payment at &euro;714.23 for each year of service up to 20 years&rsquo; service with a County Council or what was at the time a County Borough Corporation, at &frac12; this rate for service with what was at the time a Borough Corporation or an Urban District Council, and at &frac14; this rate for service as a Town Commissioner.  For service in excess of 20 years prior to 4 May 2000, the foregoing rates are reduced by 1\/3rd for each additional year of service up to a further 20 years.  However, where a person was a member of more than one local authority (e.g. a county council and an urban district council), at the one time, only one of those periods may be reckoned in calculating the ex-gratia payment and that will be in respect of the membership which is most favourable.<\/p><p>  There is an overall limit of 40 years&rsquo; service for the gratuity and ex-gratia payment combined, with the service reckoned for the purposes of a gratuity calculated first and the residual number of years being used to calculate any ex-gratia payment.  Where an outgoing councillor seeks election to a County Council and is successful, service as a county or town councillor is held on record for calculating the gratuity when that elected member retires or fails to be re-elected at a later stage.  Where an outgoing councillor, including a town councillor, seeks but is not successful in being elected to a county or city or city and county council, a gratuity will be payable in accordance with the arrangements set out above.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000067#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Waiting Lists","counter":436,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000067#WRQ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":437,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[8654\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000067#WRQ01400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if a Court repossession order is sufficient proof that a home loan is unsustainable and, therefore, bestowing eligibility - with regard to that issue - for inclusion on social housing list; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

To maximise the social housing gain from constrained resources, the social housing leasing initiative and the Rental Accomodation Scheme each play their part as long term social housing supports.  Alongside expanding the role of the Approved Housing Bodies in terms of acquisitions and construction, other mechanisms will include options to purchase within the leasing model and build to lease.

The Computer Crime Investigation Unit (CCIU) of the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation is the primary Garda unit responsible for investigating computer crime in Ireland. <\/p><p>  While the investigation of certain aspects of computer crime is undertaken directly by the CCIU, the Unit also provides expert assistance to Senior Investigating Officers and Investigation Teams tasked with the investigation of this type of criminality on a District and Divisional basis. <\/p><p>  Members of the CCIU also provide warnings to the public in relation to various types of cybercrime, including Computer viruses, Denial-of-service attacks, Malware (malicious code), Fraud and identity theft and Phishing scams.

Given the difficult financial situation faced by many fishermen because of their restricted fishing opportunities so far this year, I have asked for the Quota Management Advisory Committee to meet this Friday with a view to immediately reviewing upwards the catch limits for February and March. The objective of the meeting will be to secure industry support with a view to immediately increasing quotas available to fishermen to allow them catch more fish in the coming weeks, if the weather continues to be suitable for fishing, allowing them to increase their income to compensate for their earlier losses. <\/p><p>  In relation to any specific payments to compensate for lost earnings, the Minister for Social Protection has the overall responsibility for funding income support to individuals and families in the circumstances that have arisen.

The State controls are there to protect public health and indeed the international reputation of Irish seafood thereby ensuring the future of this important sector.  <\/p><p>  Killary Harbour has been on a closed biotoxin status for azaspiracid toxins since last June and I understand was closed for some months prior to April 2013 also.

In this context, my Department has been collaborating for some years with the Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis (CVERA) in UCD and with DEFRA in the United Kingdom on research into a vaccine to control tuberculosis in badgers and to break the link of infection to cattle.  Research has demonstrated that oral vaccination of badgers in a captive environment with BCG vaccine generates high levels of protective immunity against bovine TB.  Field trials are also being undertaken at present, involving the vaccination of several hundred badgers over 3 to 4 years, with continuous monitoring of the population to assess the impact of the vaccine on the incidence of disease in the vaccinated and non-vaccinated control badger populations. Success in the field trials is designed to eventually lead to implementation of a vaccination strategy as part of the national TB control programme. As it will be some years before full results of the trials will be available, targeted badger removals will continue in the medium term.<\/p><p>Conclusions about the success of badger removal, in terms of bovine TB levels, cannot be reached on the basis of a single year&rsquo;s results.  Rather, trends over a number of years have to be taken into account and it is the case that there has been a very significant improvement in the TB situation in recent years and, in particular, since 2008: the number of reactors has declined by almost 50% from around 30,000 in 2008 to 15,600 last year<font color=\"#004080\">, <\/font>which represented a 15 % reduction on 2012 levels.<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>   This is a new record low since the commencement of the eradication programme in the 1950s and, for the first time since the programme was introduced in the 1950s, eradication is now a practicable proposition. The improved situation has also resulted in a significant reduction in expenditure on the TB eradication scheme, which has fallen from &euro;55 m in 2008 to &euro;30 m in 2013.<\/p><p>While it is difficult to quantify the precise impact of badger culling on the reduction in the incidence of TB in Ireland over the past 10 years or so, my Department believes that much of the improvement is in fact due to the badger removal programme. In this regard, it is noteworthy that a recent peer-reviewed study, <i>Bovine tuberculosis trends in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, 1995&ndash;2010 (Abernethy et al., 2013),<\/i>   published in the Veterinary Record, found that, during the period studied, the animal incidence of TB increased by 380% in England, by 190% in Wales and by 74% in Northern Ireland. On the other hand, the animal incidence in Ireland fell by 32% in the same period (and by a further 20% since the study). Significantly, the removal of badgers is not practised in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. <\/p><p>  The badger removal policy was introduced in light of research conducted over the years by the Department and others which demonstrated that the eradication of Bovine TB is not a practicable proposition until the issue of the reservoir of infection in badgers, which is seeding infection into the cattle population, is addressed.  Capturing of badgers is not permitted during the months of  February and March (the breeding season) in new capture areas.  It is not proposed to extend this period to May. <\/p><p>  With regard to the badger population, a complaint by the Irish Wildlife Trust that badgers in Ireland were under threat was dismissed by the Standing Committee of the Bern Convention which noted Ireland&rsquo;s badger population is not being threatened and that badger numbers are being maintained at safe low levels. While estimating wild animal populations is a difficult task, current estimates are that badger numbers in the Republic of Ireland are in the range of 70,000-90,000. In addition, even in those lands where badger populations are being controlled, the local density of badgers is on a par or greater than the norms found on mainland Europe. Furthermore, Department sponsored research in collaboration with Teagasc is being finalised that concludes that badgers in Ireland are abundant everywhere and not under any threat of extinction.  This research will be published shortly when it has completed the peer review process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000074#WRX01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":623,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000074#WRX01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":622,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000074#WRX01350"},{"type":"question","counter":623,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[8739\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000074#WRX01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she has established an information officer, if this person is in charge of developing and implementing data protection in his Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":624,"content":"<p>My Department is currently launching a new records management protocol and database system to manage all records held \/ created within the Department.

The process of sending the Heads of Bill to that Committee will ensure that the provisions of the proposed legislation will be subject to public scrutiny and it is of course open to that Committee to invite and encourage submissions from all interested  parties.   In the meantime I am open to any proposals or suggestions in relation to policy on this matter that assists in achieving as much access as possible in a manner that is legally and constitutionally sound. <\/p><p>  I have been anxious to see improvements in existing procedures for the tracing of birth parents by people who have been adopted.  The Child and Family Agency, which was established on 1st January last, has advised me that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption should contact the Adoption Authority of Ireland or the Child and Family Agency&rsquo;s Community Services who will assist in directing them to the personnel dealing with their particular records.  The existing arrangements for those seeking access to information reflect a transition from complex and historical situations and I am anxious that the Agency implement much more improved and consistent arrangements. I have been advised by the  Agency that it is reorganising adoption services in 2014 at a national level,  and will consider how best to deploy its staff to deal with this important issue so as to facilitate access to records where they exist. <\/p><p>  The Adoption Act 2010, requirement that agencies providing Information and Tracing services would gain accreditation resulted in a number of religious orders deciding not to apply for accreditation and transferring records from their Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies to the Agency.  In the case of the Sacred Heart Adoption Society, for example, some 25,000 records have been transferred to the Agency&rsquo;s Regional Adoption Service in Cork.  Work by the Agency on the organising and storage of these records has taken place.  The advice of the National Archives has been sought in relation to the proper storage of these records that are of great significance. <\/p><p>  I have raised the importance of arrangements for the management of these records directly with the Child and Family Agency and I have also asked my officials to examine the work that could be undertaken with the Child and Family Agency, the Adoption Authority and other stakeholders to improve arrangements for managing and accessing the records that are available. <\/p><p>  I would urge birth mothers to enrol on the National Adoption Contact Preference Register which was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  Applicants decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland has responsibility for the operation of the Contact Preference Register.  I believe there is an opportunity in the context of the considerable public attention this area is receiving to promote awareness amongst women whose children were adopted of the importance of registering their consent for contact to be re-established.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000074#WRX01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inter-Country Adoptions","counter":628,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000074#WRX01750"},{"type":"question","counter":629,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[8768\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000074#WRX01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding the negotiations between the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the Russian authorities regarding the bilateral agreement on inter-country adoptions and when will the AAI have finalised the wording of the agreement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":630,"content":"<p>Efforts are ongoing in my Department in relation to a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption between Ireland and the Russian Federation.

As part of this ongoing work, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population and on the environment is being conducted by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department. The Department is also collaborating in a University College Cork-led research project, \"Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth\" (FACCT).  The study will consider the impact of changes on the oral health of children, following policy decisions relating to toothpaste use by infants and young children made in 2002 and the reduction in the level of fluoridation in drinking water introduced in 2007.  In addition, a study on general and oral health findings in adults linked to the duration of exposure to fluoridated water as part of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA) will commence shortly.<\/p><p>  The Forum on Fluoridation, established in 2000, reviewed the policy of water fluoridation and recommended in 2002 that it should continue as a public health measure.

The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, i.e. the adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the optimal recommended level for the prevention of dental caries, does not cause any ill effects and protects the oral health of the population. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000075#WRY00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance Cover","counter":635,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000075#WRY00350"},{"type":"question","counter":636,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[8836\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022000075#WRY00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the VHI will be recapitalised; his views on whether changes to tax relief on medical insurance will result in an increased capital requirement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These regulations allowed a five year derogation from that limit for vehicles registered, licensed or in use prior to 1 November 2008.

In light of the foregoing, I did not extend the derogation in relation to vehicle heights as this would have the effect of ensuring that those operators who were pro-actively compliant with this legislation would continue to be at a competitive disadvantage, while those that did not comply would benefit.
