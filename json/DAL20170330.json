The structure of the debate means I will not be able to respond at the end, unfortunately.  I will try to get in contact with colleagues after the debate to respond to the issues they raise.  I apologise for not being able to respond in the Chamber, but that has not been provided for in this debate.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to set out the context for the establishment of the direct provision system.  Services for all protection applicants who are in State-provided accommodation or who live in the community are delivered under the Government's policies of direct provision and dispersal.  This policy was established in 2000 when the then health boards, which were responsible for homeless people, found themselves unable to cope with a large influx of individuals who were claiming asylum in Ireland.  Some 1,500 people in the protection process were being provided with accommodation and full board by the Government in May 2000, but that number had increased to 4,200 by May 2001 and to 7,200 by May 2005.  As of the middle of this month, some 4,500 people are living in State-provided accommodation, 77% of whom have been in such accommodation for three years or less.  I will return to this issue later.<\/p>  <p>  It is important for us all to be clear on our understanding of what exactly is meant by direct provision.  It is the system whereby State services are delivered directly to protection applicants through the relevant Department or agency.  For example, the Department of Education and Skills delivers education services through the established school system and the HSE delivers medical services through the established GP and hospital systems.  In the case of the Department of Justice and Equality, full-board accommodation is offered to residents while their applications for protection are being processed.  Not every person who seeks international protection in Ireland chooses to accept the offer of full-board accommodation.  Many applicants choose to live with colleagues, family members or friends in communities across the country, as they are entitled to do.  Direct provision is not about detention, disregarding human rights or treating people in the protection process differently from people in the wider community.  Since this system was established in 2000, some 60,000 people have been provided with full-board accommodation and full access to the State&rsquo;s medical and education services.  Last evening, over 4,000 people were provided with full-board accommodation by the State.  If the State was not providing this service, where would these people have stayed?  How would they have been provided with medical and health care?  How would children have been linked in with preschool, primary and post-primary education?<\/p>  <p>  During previous debates on direct provision in these Houses and in the media, there has often been a focus on calls to end the system.  I have yet to hear anyone say what they would replace it with.  Would they replace it with a system based on cash or vouchers?  If colleagues have suggestions for what we might replace the current system with, I ask them to give me the details of what they would like to see happening.  I assume that we do not want the vulnerable people for whom we are responsible protecting to join the lengthy social housing waiting lists or to enter the private rental market with little hope of finding affordable and secure accommodation.  The offer of State-provided accommodation is a guarantee that everyone who walks into the international protection office today will have a bed, food, a shower and medical care tonight.  They will not be forced to spend the night on the streets or to seek emergency housing.  This arrangement is not something to be thrown away blindly without care for its replacement, particularly as we have a housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  No system is without room for improvement.  Our job is to continue to enhance and develop the entire system so that the best possible set of facilities and services can be provided to those in our care.  To that end, the Government commissioned a retired judge, Bryan McMahon, to chair a working group charged with compiling a report into the protection process and the system of direct provision.  His report, which was published in June 2015, forms the basis for ongoing improvements across the entirety of the system, involving all relevant Departments and agencies.<\/p><p>A Programme for a Partnership Government states:<\/p><blockquote>Long durations in direct provision are acknowledged to have a negative impact on family life.  We are therefore committed to reforming the Direct Provision system, with particular focus on families and children.<\/blockquote><p>On 23 February we published the latest audit of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the McMahon report, which shows that 121 of the recommendations have been implemented, with a further 38 partially implemented or in progress.  In total, 92% of the 173 recommendations have been implemented, partially implemented or are in progress, a significant increase on the figure of 80% we reported on last June.<br\/><br\/>The Department is implementing a large number of commitments contained in A Programme for a Partnership Government within two broad themes.  The first of these is by way of reforming legislation with the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 on 31 December 2016.  A key feature of this legislation is the introduction of a new single application procedure that will, in time, significantly accelerate the protection-determination process and, by extension, reduce the length of time which applicants spend in State provided accommodation.  The new processing arrangements will determine certainty of status at an earlier stage for those entitled to international protection within the State.  The Act is intended to achieve the desired balance between treating asylum seekers with humanity and respect and ensuring more efficient immigration procedures and safeguards.<br\/><br\/>Under the regime that existed up to the commencement of the Act, the protection process had four discrete steps: a refugee status determination at first instance; a refugee status determination on appeal; a subsidiary protection determination at first instance; and a subsidiary protection determination on appeal.  Members will appreciate that, in light of the multi-layered protection system which existed up to 31 December 2016, those refused asylum at first instance but still pending in the protection process could be pending at asylum appeal stage, pending at-first-instance subsidiary protection stage, pending at subsidiary protection appeal stage, or be challenging an asylum subsidiary protection determination in the courts through the medium of judicial review proceedings.  The process could, therefore, be and very often was of considerable length.  Figures prepared for consideration by the working group to report to Government on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and other supports for asylum seekers, in 2015 showed that 2,695 persons had been in State-provided accommodation for three or more years at that time.  Recent analysis has shown that this figure has now been reduced to just over 1,200 persons.  The number of persons in State-provided accommodation for five years or more has been reduced to less than 600 persons.<br\/><br\/>Our analysis has also shown that practically all cases of persons living in State-provided accommodation for over five years which could be processed have now been processed.  The remaining approximately 250 cases have been reviewed and cannot be processed for a number of reasons, including applicants judicially reviewing earlier decisions.  This was a major achievement and has impacted directly on the lives of a large number of persons in the protection and related systems.<br\/><br\/>The single procedure will speed up the processing of claims and the clear ambition here is that the day of applicants residing for very lengthy periods in direct provision will be over.  For many years, people have rightly sought an end to the sometimes lengthy multi-sequential determination process.  The new process is addressing those very issues.  It is in the interest of everyone, not least the applicants themselves, that all protection applications are dealt with speedily efficiently and in accordance with the highest international standards.<br\/><br\/>The second major theme of improvements is in the area of the delivery of services overseen by the Reception and Integration Agency of the Department of Justice and Equality and other Departments and Government agencies.  The Reception and Integration Agency oversees the provision of full-board accommodation for protection applicants while they await decisions on their claims for international protection.<br\/><br\/>Following the McMahon report and, in particular, since the publication of A Programme for a Partnership Government, a number of recommendations on physical improvements to accommodation are being implemented.  The following are some examples.  There has been the introduction of full independent living at the Mosney accommodation centre.  Each family is now able to acquire fresh food to their liking so they may prepare meals themselves.  The new home-cooking arrangements at Mosney went live on 23 January 2017.  Residents' kitchens have been installed in a number of accommodation centres to provide for home cooking by residents and their families.  Cooking facilities are being rolled out to other centres including the State-owned centres in Killarney, Tralee, Athlone, Knocklisheen in Limerick and Kinsale Road in Cork, as well as in Ballyhaunis, Millstreet, St Patrick's in Monaghan and any other centres in which families are resident.<br\/><br\/>There has been a complete refurbishment consisting of triple-glazed windows and doors, and refurbished interiors in each accommodation unit at the Athlone accommodation centre.  A number of outdoor playgrounds and football pitches have been improved to provide for all-weather facilities.  Centres now have teenagers' rooms to provide social areas for this age group.  Recommendations in the McMahon report that involve structural changes or improvements will be implemented as quickly as possible, with due consideration of possible fire safety, building regulation and planning issues.<br\/><br\/>The Department has also co-ordinated the preparation of a multi-departmental information booklet for persons who have been granted any type of leave to remain in the State.  The booklet contains practical and useful information for residents on housing, finances, health care, education as well as television licences, public transport and other related matters.  It has been prepared with the assistance of the National Adult Literacy Agency to ensure that it is presented in plain English. The booklet has been translated into a number of languages.  In addition to the publication of the booklet, a number of NGOs have been awarded moneys under the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund specifically to provide assistance to persons who have been granted protection and who are now in a position to move out of State-provided accommodation.  At the end of December 2016, there were approximately 450 persons with some form of status continuing to reside in State-provided accommodation.  Notwithstanding the housing crisis, we are working with the NGO community and residents alike to ensure that those with permission to remain in the State are assisted in finding mainstream accommodation as soon as possible and that State-provided accommodation remains available for those in most need.  Those people, even though they have permission to remain, are still provided for in these centres.<br\/><br\/>In January 2016 the Minister for Social Protection increased the rate of allowance paid to children in State-provided accommodation from &euro;9.60 per week to &euro;15.60 per week.  In recent years the Minister for Education and Skills introduced a scheme to provide supports in line with the current student grant scheme to school Ieavers who are in the protection system and who meet the eligibility criteria.<br\/><br\/>Another key recommendation of the McMahon report was that the remit of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children should be extended to cover those who are living in State-provided accommodation.  This has now been implemented and both offices will begin to accept complaints with effect from Monday, 3 April 2017.  Obviously, these two offices are completely independent and objective.  We welcome that and we look forward to any advice they might have for us in those areas.  They are completely free to visit any of these centres at any time.<br\/><br\/>As can be seen from the foregoing, significant improvements have either been implemented or are being implemented across all aspects of the system of supports for those in the protection process.  This work will continue through the remainder of 2017 and beyond.  Our intention is to ensure that the best possible service is provided to those seeking protection by way of a speedy, effective and efficient decision-making process combined with a system that meets the basic needs of persons in that process.<br\/><br\/>I take this opportunity to say that I would welcome applications from groups or organisations with proposals to provide, run and manage accommodation centres in response to the current call for expressions of interest published recently by the Department.  I have visited many of the accommodation centres under contract to the Department since taking office.  I know that in recent times other Members have also visited accommodation centres in a discreet and respectful manner without fanfare or publicity, respecting the privacy and sensitivities of the people there.  I will continue to have an open approach to any colleagues who wish to do so in the future.  When colleagues speak here today some will do so from the experience of having visited these centres and know what they are talking about.  Their experience is recent and not historical, going back over five or ten years.<br\/><br\/>I have spoken with residents and representatives of residents.  I have listened to their concerns and I am working on addressing them.  This work will focus on improving processing times and improving the facilities available to all those in our care.  The work we are currently engaged in will improve the processing time for applications for international protection and the accommodation and facilities being provided by the State for those in the protection process.<br\/><br\/>I look forward to hearing the views of Members on this matter.  Constructive criticism is always welcome.  I assure all Members that their views will be carefully considered as we continue to enhance the full range of services being provided to those in the protection system.  As I said at the outset, I regret that I will not be able to respond to this debate this morning.  However, I will respond to colleagues' comments and suggestions, including offers of assistance they may have for people who come to our shores looking for asylum.  These are different from people who are refugees who get accommodation in the emergency reception and orientation centres, EROCs.<\/p><p>That is a different system completely and one should not mix those two up.  EROCs are totally different to the direct provision system.<\/p> <p> I hope colleagues will agree that we are working hard to improve the direct provision system, as I said, to have more speedy decisions than we had up to now so that applicants will not have to wait as long for a decision to be made and to continue to improve the conditions where people are living.  As I say, I have visited lots of these centres and will continue to do so.  I meet the people there and listen to them.  I met one lady the other day and she said, \"I feel safe.  I have no complaints.  I am safe.  I am happy.  I am looked after.  I have friends who look after me.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000003#A00200","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490865300,"counter":9,"content":"<p>On a point of order, t&aacute; br&oacute;n orm.

I acknowledge the good work he has done.  I am in no doubt that the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, in everything he is doing in this area, is incredibly well intentioned and is working hard to improve the lot of those in direct provision.  That, essentially, is what we all are aiming and hoping for.<\/p>  <p>  I also acknowledge that while the Minister of State cannot respond to what we are saying, I appreciate that he has committed to taking on board our comments, views, observations and opinions and that he will take them in the well-intentioned way they are made, not as a criticism of himself but certainly as a criticism of the service that we want to continue to improve.<\/p>  <p>  There are almost 5,000 people currently in direct provision.  In my view, they exist in a dehumanising environment.  They are unable to work.  They are unable to attend third level education.  Most of them, while acknowledging the work that has gone on in Mosney, cannot cook for their own families.  They receive a paltry amount of money - &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;15.60 per child per week.  In many cases, that money has to go towards food, schoolbooks, school trips and outings for the children.  It is a very small amount of money.<\/p>  <p>  My figures on those who are in direct provision are slightly different to those of the Minister of State.  My figures show that 40% of asylum seekers have been in direct provision for five years and approximately 20% for more than seven years.  The position has improved in the recent past.<\/p>  <p>  No matter what, the damage done in any long-term stay in these centres is incalculable.  The key issues facing these people in direct provision are the duration of the stay, the impact of the environment on family life and the right to work.<\/p>  <p>  I read with great sadness a recent newspaper article about a 16 year old girl, who was a victim of violence in her home country, was chronically traumatised and was suffering greatly in a direct provision centre in Ireland.  Diagnosed with psychosis, this teenager's mental health deteriorated to the extent that she has had to be made a ward of court as her health was in serious danger.  This girl and the 1,600 or more children who have grown up in the direct provision system have endured overcrowded conditions, social exclusion and psychological damage associated with living in institutionalised accommodation.  We, as a country, can do better.  We must do better by these young people.  The current system is not fit for purpose and it needs to be replaced to enable asylum seekers to live with a greater degree of respect and dignity.<\/p>  <p>  I realise that direct provision cannot be dismantled overnight and it will take some time to get there.  I believe the end of direct provision must be the ultimate goal and will offer thoughts on changes that could be made in the short and long term.  In the short term, we need to create and build a humane system by fully implementing the McMahon report.  At present, the Department claims that more than 90% of this has been carried out but in speaking to residents, I do not discern that much has changed for them.  Certainly, there have been some improvements but it is happening at far too slow a pace.  I acknowledge that in some centres, in Mosney in particular, proper functioning cooking facilities have been introduced.  It is good that residents can purchase foods via a points system.  This needs to be rolled out.<\/p>  <p>  An amendment to the International Protection Act 2015 permitting asylum seekers the right to work is hugely important.  This could be in line with the provisions in the EU reception directive, which permits asylum seekers to work if no decision on their application for asylum has issued after nine months.  During the consultation process for the working group, together with the long length of stay in the system, the right to work was one of residents' biggest issues and I have come across that on a personal level.  These two factors combined mean that by the time people leave direct provision at present, they have become completely deskilled and demotivated and find it really difficult to enter the labour market.  In fact, the direct provision creates huge dependency.<\/p>  <p>  It is important also to increase the weekly allowance to the amounts recommended by the McMahon report.  Such an increase would have a real and tangible impact on the quality of life of those living in direct provision by allowing them a greater degree of choice and improving their ability to participate in the community within which they live.  It is hugely important that we begin to create a system that allows families and the vulnerable to have access to independent, not communal, living following a short stay in centre-type accommodation.  Direct provision is no place for families and has been consistently criticised.<\/p>  <p>  In the longer term, we must design a more humane system.  One of the key differences of our system when compared with those of other EU countries is that it is operated for profit.  I appreciate the Minister of State's observation that calls for expressions of interest are under way at present.  While it remains a profitable system for some, it will not be humane.  As a result, the Government has been keeping its responsibility at arm's length to a certain extent.  While we have been contracting out the care of the vulnerable to private entities for profit, basically, creating modern-day Magdalen laundries, we need to move to a system the Minister of State suggested in his speech, which I appreciate.  Putting out calls specifically for not-for-profit entities with experience is hugely important.  The ultimate aim must be to create a blended system, such as that in Portugal, where asylum seekers, following a short initial stay in a reception centre in which their needs are assessed by an assigned case worker who deals with all aspects of their claims, can move out into community self-contained units.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister of State's announcement that legal issues regarding the extension of the remit of the offices of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children to include access for residents in direct provision centres have now been clarified.  That is hugely important.  As the Ombudsman for Children pointed out, \"1,400 children are ... spending formative years of their lives in direct provision, in circumstances that inhibit their potential to thrive and curtail their full enjoyment of basic rights\".<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that while the current housing shortage clearly creates a huge challenge in being able to access accommodation, there are also many other hurdles, particularly around education and the right to work.  I will mention briefly the 2016 report, \"Transition: from Direct Provision to life in the community\".  This report highlighted the multiple challenges faced by former asylum seekers in attempting to make that transition.  As the Minister of State pointed out, many are not able to make that transition.  They are still in the direct provision centre.<\/p>  <p>  Having endured years of living in the system - it is known to negatively affect mental health, child well-being and family life - people are largely left to fend for themselves once they receive their status.  People have to navigate a complex array of systems as they attempt to move out of institutions that have systematically disempowered them for many years.<\/p><p>This is a key point in all of this.  Those transitioning also face significant barriers in accessing education and employment.  The years spent in direct provision are not counted towards eligibility for the back to education allowance.  Finding even low-skilled employment proves extremely difficult given that participants have not been permitted to work for many years.  We now see the very negative impact.<\/p> <p> On Monday, I visited the Eyre Powell centre in Newbridge where 68 people live, including seven children under the age of 18.  I was very struck by the energy of the young people living there.  Many young men there have just completed coaching courses with a local sports partnership.  They were incredibly enthusiastic about wanting to contribute to their community.  Supervisors in the sports partnership scheme would absolutely love to bring these young men out into the community to work with voluntary organisations, sporting and otherwise.  We have some festivals coming up but unfortunately-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000005#C01200","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490865900,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Only a few minutes remain for the Deputy's colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000006#D00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1490865900,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I know that.

It was a great day of celebration when scholarships were announced for young asylum seekers living in direct provision.  NUI Galway is providing scholarships for people who have done incredibly well in education, giving them the opportunity to go forward.  The young people told powerful stories, such as the first time Connacht won a European rugby competition, and how the young men sat in their bedrooms having to watch it on their phones while all of their friends were able to watch it into houses.  Some of the schoolchildren in the Gallery possibly do not really understand what we are speaking about with regard to direct provision.  Children in direct provision have problems with studying.  They face real challenges trying to study for the junior or leaving certificate when they go home in the evenings to their shared bedrooms.  However, they have attained incredibly high standards, which was acknowledged by NUI Galway, which has opened up an opportunity for children whereby they will be funded to go to third level college.  The young people also spoke very passionately about their lack of access to playgrounds.  I am a mother of three children and people can take this for granted.  We all have back gardens where we are able to put up our slides and our swings.  The children living in direct provision do not have this opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work being done by the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton.  He is completely compassionate and engaging and has done much work over the past 12 months, which as Deputy O'Loughlin has commented, can be seen.

There has been much talk over recent weeks about President Trump's ban on people travelling from certain countries throughout the Middle East, about which the Irish people were outraged and rightly so.  Successive Governments have failed to deal comprehensively with what I consider to be quite a discriminatory policy that lies directly at our feet.  I acknowledge Deputy Stanton's bona fides and intentions this area, but I consider it to be a discriminatory policy.<\/p>  <p>  In 2000, the then Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Justice, John O&rsquo;Donoghue, commenced a new programme aimed at tackling the issue of refugees coming here to seek asylum.  These refugees, many of whom were fleeing war torn areas, came to Ireland in search of safety, in the hope of escaping persecution in their country of origin.  The system was seen as a way of housing these people, providing them with basics while the asylum application was being processed.  Today in Ireland 35 of these centres are active throughout the State, housing approximately 4,500 people.<\/p>  <p>  Like Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster, the system has become much more than intended and is now quite grotesque, housing people for many years longer than intended and in unacceptable conditions.  As Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on children I will speak on direct provision from a child protection and children&rsquo;s rights perspective.  It was only last month the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, announced she had clarified legal issues that prohibited the Ombudsman for Children from receiving complaints from or regarding children living in direct provision.  This is not before time and is long overdue.  It is due to happen next month but should have happened many years ago.<\/p>  <p>  Children living in direct provision are subject to substandard living conditions in an environment not conducive to growth and development.  These children come from different areas of the world and from conditions so bleak they are practically unimaginable to us.  They have experienced extraordinary amounts of trauma and have been persecuted from a very young age.  Many of these children arrived in this country seeking asylum and a new life of dignity, allowing them to live rather than simply to exist.  However, in many ways they face persecution and discrimination of a different type on entering the State.<\/p>  <p>  Every year, the Children's Rights Alliance produces a report card.  It scored the Government D minus for lack of progress on direct provision.  I will highlight two issues from the McMahon report which have not been implemented adequately.<\/p><p>In 2015, HIQA published a report which highlighted that the child protection referral rate is significantly higher for children in direct provision compared with the general population.  I understand it remains quite high.  The commitment to introduce national standards for direct provision centres was not realised in 2016.  They are essential to ensure children in direct provision are afforded equity of care with all children in care and that service providers are required to maintain consistent standards across the different services.  The working group highlighted this as an issue and that there are advantages but there has not been progress on it.<\/p> <p> I was not present when the Minister of State made his contribution but I listened to it in my office.  He spoke about the issue of food and the ability to cook, which is an issue that has come up regularly.  He said it was being rolled out.  My understanding from RIA's monthly statistics is that there are 128 spaces in self-catering accommodation, which is a small proportion of the 4,500.  According to the most recent RIA statistics from January, 128 people can be accommodated.  It is something that needs to be resolved.<\/p> <p> I could raise many other points.  We should remove many of the hard edges from the system in terms of food, sleeping conditions, child protection, national standards and all the rest of it.  Direct provision will always remain a problematic and discriminatory system.  We need to allow people who are coming here seeking asylum a far greater degree of autonomy and control over their own lives.   The Minister of State made a point about housing lists.  I acknowledge there is enormous pressure on social housing and rented accommodation but the choice should be available.  There should be a fall-back for people if they are unable to find accommodation.  They should have the option of being able to find their own accommodation if they can, which is integrated into the community.  We need to work towards that.  They also deserve the right to work and to further their education.  I have met many young people in direct provision, and one of their great frustrations is that they work very hard all the way through school, yet the possibility of progressing any further than their leaving certificate is very minimal.  There is a programme for third level education but very small numbers avail of it.  It is a cause of great frustration.  They are the issues we need to deal with to allow people seeking asylum independent living and autonomy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000006#D01800","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490866500,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue which is of huge concern to many of us here.  With good reason, direct provision can be called the Magdalen laundries of our time.  I believe it will be the subject of inquiry in years to come.  Direct provision centres are often referred to as holding camps and sites of deportability.  The Free Legal Advice Centres states that these privately owned centres which are administered by the Government constitute a direct provision industry which makes a profit on direct provision.  It is a privatised system, initiated by Fianna F&aacute;il and run by highly profitable private companies making more than &euro;50 million a year.  Recently a centre in Limerick was closed by the Department of Justice and Equality due to health and safety standards being ignored.  There remains no accountability or transparency and no clear process of tendering for these centres.  There are no support services or expertise among staff working on sites.  Since the implementation of the International Protection Act only the legal elements of the McMahon report have been introduced.  The issues around direct provision are still the same and, according to asylum seekers, are getting worse.<\/p>  <p>  I have raised the issue of children growing up in direct provision previously in the Chamber on both the Grace case and on the Tuam mother and baby home.  I have said that I fear direct provision will be the child protection scandal of our time.  It is incredibly frustrating to hear representatives speak time and again about the wrongs in our system in the past while dangerous circumstances exist in direct provision centres all across the State.  Will we all be here wringing our hands again in ten or 20 years?  I fear we will.  The issues surrounding child protection and children&rsquo;s health and well-being are huge.  Families are sharing single rooms in cramped facilities with no space for children to study in peace.  Children are regularly in close proximity to strangers.  There is no place for recreation for children and no areas for visitors or school friends to come to spend time with them.  Direct provision has been likened to an open prison, with people spending years in facilities that were originally built for people to remain in for six months.  People have lost hope and their spirits are being killed.  It is completely inhumane.<\/p>  <p>  Where have we heard this sort of language before?  Our history, which we recently discussed in the Chamber, is eerily similar.  There is no independent complaints mechanism for people living in direct provision.  There is no Ombudsman, Children's Ombudsman or HIQA oversight.  This is institutional abuse of the highest order with vulnerable people being exploited for massive profit.  People are existing on the &euro;19 a week payment with no right to work and no right to education.  Children who have grown up here within the school system, learning through English, study hard for their leaving certificate and receive the points for college only to be told they have no prospects for college or training and no chance to create a life and support themselves.<\/p>  <p>  The International Protection Act was meant to solve this system but it appears to have been nothing but a Trojan horse.  It has put direct provision on a permanent footing, and asylum seekers and NGOs who co-operated with the working group are extremely disappointed with the result.  The introduction last month of a new asylum application procedure has created chaos for thousands of people living in direct provision.  There are serious issues with the new single procedure for processing applications.  People were sent a long application form recently with a totally unrealistic deadline and translations that were done using Google Translate, which beggars belief.  There is a lack of people available to give legal advice and people are unfortunately making statements in error as a result of difficulties with the form, which will inevitably jeopardise their applications in future.  The Department has given an extension after significant lobbying, which is welcome, but the whole system is stacked against people.<\/p>  <p>  Direct provision should and must be scrapped.  There are other models which can be looked at and which NGOs such as the Irish Refugee Council, Doras Luimn&iacute; and Nasc have been proposing.  At a time of unprecedented refugee crises across the world, when a focus on human rights is most needed, the whole system appears to be designed to facilitate and speed up deportations.  We need to scrap direct provision and introduce a new system that treats people humanely, a system of which we can be proud rather than ashamed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000007#E00200","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1490866500,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank People Before Profit for putting this matter on the agenda today.  I will reflect on my experience as a Deputy in Clondalkin.  Clondalkin Towers, one of the largest direct provision centres, is in the constituency.  Like many politicians, we work very closely with the residents at that location.  Over the five or six years that I have been a public representative in the area, what has struck me most about direct provision is its purpose.  Its purpose is to segregate people from the host community, to cut them off and make it more difficult for them to develop real relationships with the local community.  That is probably one of the greatest shames of the system as it is designed.  Other speakers have spoken about the cramped conditions, the inadequate eating and cooking facilities and the paltry payments that people receive.  We all have stories of families who have been treated appallingly.  There was one very prominent story a number of years ago of a family of two adults and three children in Clondalkin Towers.  When the husband died after a prolonged illness, the family - adults and children - were expected to remain living in the same single bedroom.  There is no justification that I can think of anywhere in the world that could support such a proposition.  It is not just the length of time it is taking that is an issue, but the frustration with the process.  People do not understand and are not being informed of what is happening at every stage.<\/p>  <p>  I will not repeat the points people have made.  Direct provision is a scandal.  It is not a badly managed system.  It is not a system that needs some tweaks and changes.  It is a scandal.  It is about time every politician in the House declared it a scandal and said it has to end.  Then the conversation will change.  It is not just about removing the rough edges, although Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is right that it needs to happen, but replacing it completely with a system which allows people, very soon after they arrive, to live and work in communities while their applications are being processed.  It is not just the right thing to do from a human rights point of view; it is the right thing to do for the taxpayer.  The cost of direct provision versus the cost of an asylum applicant living in the local community is very clear to see.  I put in freedom of information requests about Clondalkin Towers and was given information of the payments the State has made to that facility over six years.  We are talking about &euro;1.7 million being spent over seven years.  On average, 233 adults and children are meant to be there throughout the course of the year.<\/p><p>In many cases, they are not there but the payment is still being made.  This means that for a family of two adults and two children, for example, the cost of direct provision is &euro;31,000, on average, per year.  The equivalent cost for the same family on JSA and HAP is at least &euro;10,000 per year cheaper.  If people were allowed to work, particularly those with skills, the cost would be even less.  Not only is this an appalling abuse of human rights, it is an appalling waste of taxpayer's money to the tune of millions of euro.<\/p> <p> I wish to mention two other issues.  The first is another scandal, namely, how the State treats people who have been granted leave to remain or their stamp 4.  A total of 400 families who have the right to remain and work but who cannot get accommodation are trapped in direct provision.  Those people are essentially homeless and direct provision has become their emergency accommodation.  They are not getting jobseeker's allowance; they are still getting the reduced rate JSA, even though it is a JSA claim.  They cannot save for a deposit.  There are no additional supports for them to access private or public housing, let alone education or employment.  I urge the Minister of State to consider the type of housing programme involved - he is looking at programme refugees, which I support - and making it available, with supports, to people transitioning out of direct provision.<\/p> <p> While it is slightly off topic, the final issue I would like to raise is still relevant.  There are 126,000 undocumented migrants in this State.  Ministers and politicians from across the House were in the US recently calling on the US President to find a system for regularising undocumented Irish migrants in the US.  We need to practice at home what we preach abroad.  I acknowledge the Minister of State is examining this but I urge him to do here exactly what we want the US Administration to do and ensure that these 126,000 people have a process to regularise their status and have the security and safety they so rightly deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000007#E00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490867100,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Solidarity - People Before Profit Deputies pushed for this debate to be put on the agenda and it has been difficult to reach agreement.  The Taoiseach justified visiting a racist, sexist American President and offering him the hand of friendship - I do not know why the Minister of State is making a face - on the grounds that he would make a case about immigration and the illegal, undocumented Irish in the US.  However, we have two scenarios in this country of undocumented people who have no status and who are not getting any assistance and the scandal of people being kept in direct provision.  Labour Party Members have not bothered their barney coming to the House for the debate.  During the previous D&aacute;il, we were led to believe by the former junior Minister, Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, that he would end direct provision and that we were on the precipice of a great development but Labour Party Members have not even shown up for this debate, which is disappointing.<\/p><p>Direct provision is an inhumane system which should be ended immediately.  Marie Williams, a constituent of mine, works with women who experience direct provision and helped establish the young mothers network with them.  Ritah and Diane, who are also founders of the network, have been in contact and supplied some comments about living conditions.  Ritah says:<\/p><blockquote>The hardest thing was the loneliness, having no-one to talk to, no-one to reach out to, no-one to check-up on you.  It's survival of the fittest in Direct Provision: people are always being moved, people are so stressed about their own situation, not knowing what the future holds, always being afraid of being deported.  That's not an environment to develop stable relationships with people.<\/blockquote><p>Diane was in an abusive relationship and she says, &quot;[Direct provision] is that tough that I chose an abusive relationship rather than live in DP.&quot;<\/p><p>Asylum seekers are given &euro;19.10 a week, are unable to cook for themselves or have anything approaching a normal family life for themselves and their children.  There is not a normal level of privacy for individuals and families.  We have also heard reports of sexual abuse and reports of people being vulnerable to all sorts of other abuse.  It is an environment in which mental health problems absolutely flourish.  Diane said:<\/p><blockquote>You're made to feel less than human. I've no trust in people anymore.  When you live with people you don't know, you develop a defence mechanism to keep yourself safe, and this has followed me. I don't know how to trust people to this day, or how to build stable relationships.<\/blockquote><p>There is a profound impact on children in direct provision as well.  They do not know anybody, they do not know the language and they see a social worker once a month.  They have no adult supervision and their lives are in the hands of strangers.<\/p><p>There is also a huge power imbalance.  One only need look at the most vulnerable people in society to know how the State would treat us all if it could get away with it.  There is a massive power imbalance in the asylum system.  Those seeking asylum have little power compared to the State and it is not unknown for people who raise issues about the conditions in particular centres to be moved to others.  There were protests at direct provision centres in 2013 and 2014.  Armed garda&iacute; were used at the Mount Trenchard centre in Limerick to remove men who had peacefully protested against the conditions in which they lived.  This arbitrary decision to move them was arrived at even after an agreement had been reached.  What more of an illustration of the power imbalance in direct provision centres can I provide?<\/p><p>Following the protests, the Minister set up a round-table working group at which the voice of asylum seekers was meant to be listened to but the opposite was the case.  The Government instead retained the direct provision system and then brought in major changes, such as the regressive International Protection Act 2015, without any consultation with people in direct provision.  The number of refugees on our planet has greatly increased due to war, etc.  According to UNHCR figures, 65.3 million people have been forcibly displaced, more than half of whom are children.  Every day, 34,000 people have to flee conflict or persecution and, instead of offering assistance, the State took a decision to send a message to them that they are not wanted and that we have a concentration camp or prison camp-style system if they come here without prior agreement.  There has been a spike in the number of refusals at points of entry to the State under this Act.  People are turned away at preliminary interview stage.  There has been a 32% decrease in asylum seeker claims in the State, yet the Taoiseach went abroad to tell all and sundry that he thinks immigration and migration are great.<\/p><p>I would like the Minister of State to comment on the form asylum seekers must complete.  It is 60 pages long and extremely complex.  The experience of asylum seekers is they are not getting the legal advice they need.  Asylum seekers and immigration solicitors have reported that there can be legal advice consultations of approximately ten minutes before the form is completed.  People with language difficulties need longer and it took somebody with fluent English an hour and a half to fill in the form.  What does this do only send a message that these people are not wanted?  There was acute distress earlier this year when people experienced this.<\/p><p>The people have recently become increasingly aware of the barbarity of the institutionalisation of people by the church and State, with both of the latter taking control over so many lives in the 20th century, including in the context of mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries and industrial schools.  However, history will record the direct provision system as being equally outrageous and barbaric.  The Solidarity Members stand for an immediate end to direct provision.  Let people live in decent homes and accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000008#F00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1490867100,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I welcome those who are advocating for an end to direct provision and those who are in direct provision and who are present in the Gallery.

I recognise that there is a lot happening, not least Deputy Paul Murphy's attendance in the courts.  Missing Deputies are in the Four Courts with the Jobstown people.  There is a great deal happening but this is important.<\/p><p>The direct provision system does not work.<\/p><p>It has been in existence since 1999.  Fianna F&aacute;il brought it in and maintained it for most of that period.  I welcome the Deputies' Damascene conversion on this issue, but they maintained it for a long time.  What we are looking at, as declared by the United Nations, Amnesty International, and Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon who delivered the report, is an inhumane, degrading system.  I will quote Mr. Justice McMahon, \"These people are like ghosts.  They are dehumanised and they are depressed.\"  Even though the Minister of State cannot answer me now, he might answer in writing whether he agrees with that statement from Mr. Justice McMahon, and more importantly, would the Minister of State agree with him that we should give a complete amnesty to everybody who has been in that system for over five years?  Of course a reception centre is needed for refugees and asylum seekers when they arrive in this country, but they should not be left there to rear their children and live their lives in it for a long time.  One woman I met has a 12 year old daughter who was born in the reception centre.  She only got out of it when the child was 12.  That is wrong and the mark of that will be left on that child and others for a long time.<\/p> <p> The other issue, mentioned by other Deputies, is the question of the right to work and right to study.  With every hungry belly comes a pair of hands.  The reason for the high levels of mental ill health and depression in direct provision centres is the denial of the basic human ability to do things, to toil, to be able to change the world around oneself and to make an impact on the planet.  That is what distinguishes us as human beings.  They are not allowed to do that at all.  Of course they are depressed and mental health levels are very low.  At the very least, we need to recognise that reception centres such as this are inappropriate for people who are going to stay in the State for long periods.  They need to be given the freedom to work to make a contribution to society, and they certainly need to be given the freedom to use their brain, study, do third level degrees and improve their lives.  We would be making a huge step forward if we could provide them with even that, but we cannot because of the nature of the direct provision system itself.<\/p> <p> I notice that the Minister of State referred to the housing crisis many times in his speech.  I want to tackle an argument that exists in society.  I get it myself and I am sure I am going to get it after this debate today.  How can we look after them when we cannot look after our own?  I want to reject this idea, because our own are not being correctly looked after, if there is such a thing as our own.  I regard everybody here as my own.  Those I do not regard as my own are the people benefiting from the low corporation tax and refusing to pay it, the bankers and the developers who brought this country into a crisis and the people who are at the receiving end of the scandals around NAMA at the moment, who are profiting hugely from this.  I regard everyone who lives in this country as my own.  We would be able to look after them all if we were to justly and correctly implement a share-out of the wealth and to take back the empty properties, fix them up and to make housing accommodation available for all.  We have more than enough resources to do so and to build decent social housing.<\/p> <p> We cannot declare in the interim that one section of the population has to be isolated and treated in this way away from the rest of the population.  I will reiterate something said by others here.  The figures of profits made from the direct provision system over the years are outrageous.  The Mosney direct provision centre was paid &euro;100 million by the State and has made a donation of &euro;4,000 to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  Aramark had a turnover of &euro;223 million in 2013.  Barlow Properties received &euro;40 million from the State to run five centres.  East Coast Catering received &euro;90 million between 2000 and 2013.  When the Minister of State appeals to people here to give him ideas, and he said he would welcome applications from groups and organisations with proposals to provide, run and manage accommodation centres, I would say that while we can give proposals, they will not be to manage and run accommodation centres that intern people for decades.  I am sure there are organisations which have wonderful ways of treating people humanely.  The main thing is to give them the right to work, housing and study.  Once that is done, then there is a community which is contributing fairly to society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000008#F00500","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490867700,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I pay tribute to United Against Racism and the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland - I know Mr. Memet Uluda\u011f and Mr. Lucky Khambule and others are in the Visitors Gallery - for their efforts in bringing about this debate and in pressing the motion which has been signed by 37 Deputies.  I think it is a matter of vital importance.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach was praised and praised himself lavishly for his comments in Washington about immigrants, both Irish immigrants and immigrants generally, and how he was a champion of immigrants.  It is a little ironic, is it not, that he could do that and indeed at points imply criticism of the outrageous policies of US President Donald Trump <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>immigrants and asylum seekers in the United States and continue to stand over a degrading, inhumane, cruel system of direct provision, which is guilty of child neglect and abuse if nothing else.  It is guilty of many other things too.  The treatment of children living for years in this system of direct provision is a scandal beyond scandals.  It is not an exaggeration to say that allowing this to persist is on a par with industrial schools and the Magdalen laundries.  Tinkering around and reforms, while they may improve things marginally, are just not good enough.<\/p><p>The key here is the issue of right to work that has already been alluded to.  Nobody doubts that there is a housing emergency.  We believe it can be solved, and with the right policies, everybody in direct provision and on our housing lists can be housed.  A real move away from direct provision will not happen overnight, although a lot more could be done on it quickly if there was a change in policy, but the right to work is critical.  It is unacceptable that people are expected to live on &euro;19 a week, are imprisoned in these direct provision centres, not allowed to work, and are treated as second-class citizens.  They are treated as a sort of subhuman group in the same way as those who were slaves in the Magdalen laundries or who were prisoners in the industrial schools were treated.  All the crocodile tears or shame and regret about the Magdalen laundries and industrial schools can only be viewed as hypocrisy if the Government does not move to get rid of the system of direct provision and allow the people in that system - asylum seekers coming to this country who are here for any substantial period - the right to work and consequently integrate into society and be treated the same as other human beings who happen to be citizens of this country.  I appeal to the Minister of State and Government to do this and they will have done something important and historic in allowing asylum seekers the right to work and to be treated as dignified human beings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000009#G00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1490867700,"counter":48,"content":"<p>The treatment of asylum seekers will go down in history as one of the most shameful episodes in the history of the State.  Generations in ten and 20 years will be looking for redress for the treatment they received in this State since 16 years ago.<\/p><p>The direct provision system introduced more than 16 years ago was supposed to provide temporary accommodation for up to six months while a decision was made to accept or reject an asylum application.  I propose that one of the first things that could be done is for those applications to be quickened up.  We have had many people visit our constituency offices about it.  I know every situation is different when an application is made, but they go on and on.  Applicants are asked for more papers and it involves more work, while those applicants are still sitting in limbo in direct provision.  We now have a situation where 55% of asylum seekers have been in direct provision for more than five years, 20% of whom have been in direct provision for more than seven years.<\/p><p>Children are growing up in detention centres and that has to stop.  One example from a series in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>called &quot;Lives in Limbo&quot; was a 12 year old girl who has been living in a mobile home in a direct provision centre for eight years.  There are 1,600 children in these centres.<\/p><p>The Irish Refugee Council report on their situation found many other problems such as children living in rooms with entire families or with other families, lack of appropriate food, no child benefit or little access to play areas.  Some recommendations are to ensure a safe environment and no exposure to inappropriate behaviour, access to private toilet facilities, adequate space for families, separate rooms for parents, an option for families to choose and cook healthy food - I note the point the Minister of State made earlier but this is 15 years on - and the reinstatement of child benefit for all children living here.<\/p> <p> These are simple things.  They are interim measures but I reiterate the point made earlier that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission described the direct provision system as a severe violation of human rights.  Direct provision cuts off a whole community from another community.  That is what happened in the industrial schools, the Magdalen laundries and the mother and baby homes.  A whole layer of people was cut off from general society, was isolated and its voice was cut off in many ways.  While doing that was an attempt to keep the people down, those people fought on and raised their voices.  I know people in direct provision, now and in the future, will do the same thing.  <\/p> <p> I support the calls to abolish the direct provision system, to end the &euro;15 million going into the pockets of private contractors and to grant asylum seekers the right to work.  Ireland is one of just two EU member states where asylum seekers are prohibited from working after a designated period.  Even over in the UK, asylum seekers can work after a year, under certain conditions.  That is one of the issues that needs to be addressed.  Asylum seekers must have access to third level education.  A basic requirement in society is an education.  Asylum seekers should receive welfare benefits the same as all other residents and citizens of the State.  A transparent immigration process must be put in place.  The application process is not transparent in any shape or form.<\/p> <p> I supported and signed a similar motion put forward by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and the other 38 Deputies who signed up to it.  We debated this issue in September 2014, during the last D&aacute;il, when Deputy Pringle put it on the agenda.  This issue is not unknown to the Government.  It is well aware of it.  <\/p> <p> I will make one last point about the international protection aspect and the 60-page document.  Why and how did the Department send out a 60-page document to applicants which they were told to return in 20 days, when they had to get assistance, legal advice and papers that were already in the process and could not be accessed?  Even doing that was an absolute shame and scandal.  I am glad to hear there is an extension.  That extension should be prolonged as long as necessary to assist asylum seekers in completing the document.<\/p> <p> I will support the motion in the D&aacute;il and hope it will come before the House soon.  The Minister needs to be more proactive in this area.  I do not accept the argument about housing - that there is a problem with housing or there is not enough and questioning where asylum seekers in direct provision would be put.  There is money in this country.  We know where the wealth is.  We have, on many occasions, put forward proposals on how to deal with the housing crisis, both for our own people in emergency accommodation and for asylum seekers.  That is the answer, not using the problem as an excuse not to deal with the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000009#G00300","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490868300,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the statements on direct provision this morning.  I worked with asylum seekers in Donegal town from 1999 to 2012 when the hostel there closed.  I have seen at first hand the impact the direct provision system had on people in Donegal town.  It was a totally male hostel.  One could see the lack of motivation, the impact on people's mental health and the isolation that direct provision causes, even in a small town like Donegal town, when people are restricted from integrating.<\/p>  <p>  We used to organise events and activities for the residents of the direct provision centre and because of the lack of motivation, the mental health issues and everything else, it was practically necessary to take people out of the centre to get them to attend the events or activities.  There was absolutely no integration.  Direct provision has never been about that.  Anything the Department has said over the years about how it was encouraging integration was all lies.  It was never what was intended.  <\/p>  <p>  I firmly believe in the ending of direct provision and I previously brought a motion before the House to that end in 2014.  I firmly believe that the system of direct provision should be ended and should be ended immediately.  It would actually be cheaper for the State to give social welfare and rent allowance to all the asylum seekers and to let them live in the community and find work if they can.  That would actually save money.  In 2014, when I put forward my motion, direct provision was costing more than &euro;52 million.  Based on the number of asylum seekers and on calculations I have done, the State would have saved approximately &euro;20 million by ending direct provision.  We constantly have to deal with the Department of Justice and Equality, which believes there are hordes of people standing at our borders waiting for an easing of our system so that they can overrun us and swamp the whole country.  That is absolute rubbish.  We need to end this system and we need to end it quickly.  <\/p>  <p>  I know the Minster of State is going around and visiting all the centres around the country.  That is a welcome sight, but we heard from asylum seekers in the AV room last week who said that things improve when the Minister of State is coming for a visit.  They get better for a couple of days beforehand but then revert back to normal after he leaves.  That is a very worrying situation and needs to be investigated and checked out actively and vigorously by the Department.  Unfortunately I do not believe the refugee offices are interested in investigating complaints because we have experience of making complaints in the past which were never dealt with.  I was barred from visiting the hostel in Donegal town for the last couple of years it was operating because it did not want any scrutiny of how the asylum seekers were being forced to live.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to focus very quickly on the working group report.  The Department keeps putting out fancy figures saying 92% of the recommendations have been implemented.  They probably have but the key recommendations that are important and make a real difference to peoples lives still have not been implemented.  These are recommendations such as the right to work and guaranteeing the promised increase in allowances for people in direct provision.  It is not enough to say that it is just put back into the general budgetary remit and to leave it at that.  <\/p>  <p>  On the aforementioned document to be completed, I spoke to the Minister of State personally on this and he accepted the time limit was a mistake and should not have been stressed.  The time has been extended but it is vitally important that asylum seekers get good, sound legal advice as they fill in that application form.  It is important that is dealt with.  That is not in place for them at the moment.  The agencies and NGOs are swamped and are unable to deal with the inquiries they have on hand at present regarding that form.  The Minister of State needs to deal with this issue urgently. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, on the argument that we do not have housing for people who are successful in obtaining refugee status and consequently could not do without the centres, I note there are 21,000 empty houses and apartments in the area of Dublin City Council alone.  There are 200,000 empty houses and apartments across the country.  Why can we not house people who are successful in the asylum process?  Why can we not house our own citizens when there are 200,000 empty properties right across the country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000010#H00200","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1490868300,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I am delighted to take part in this debate although \"delight\" is the wrong word because I thought at this stage, one year after the election, that we would have decisions in respect of the most fundamental recommendation from the McMahon report, which was the right to work.  I cannot imagine what would stop any Government from giving that right.<\/p>  <p>  Second, one recommendation was that after a period of time,  I believe it was five years, nobody should be kept in direct provision without having their status legalised.  Those are two basic requirements and here we are a year later, after a new election and new promises, still talking about direct provision.  <\/p>  <p>  As it is difficult to get information, the Minister of State should correct me if the figures have changed but as of last July, 450 people had been resident in direct provision for more than seven years.  Has that figure increased or decreased?  I do not know but it is certainly shocking that we would keep people - including mothers and children - in very confined conditions for more than seven years and call ourselves a civilised society.  We have international obligations.  We are complying with those obligations in the most minimal way possible with direct provision.  We have had direct provision as a temporary measure now for 17 years.  It is now 2017, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and we started this direct provision in 2000 as a temporary measure.<\/p><p>On top of that, I know in Galway and other centres that people have been granted asylum status but cannot leave direct provision.<\/p> <p> I and many other Deputies have asked many questions and we are going around in circles.  We have been directed to the Department of Social Protection for people to get their entitlements, but that is not the issue.  The issue is that the Department of Social Protection will not talk to people in direct provision if they do not have an address.  A hostel address is not good enough for the Department.  Having being granted asylum status, people are stuck in direct provision.<\/p> <p> There are 35 centres around the country, seven of which are State owned and for which two companies have been contracted to provide services.  The other 28 are privately operated and make huge profits.  I am not criticising the providers because Government policy has allowed them to come forward.  Our human rights obligations should not be fulfilled in such a way that companies and private operators are allowed to make profits.  That is not the way to comply with our legal obligations.<\/p> <p> The system should be streamlined, as the Government is trying to do with the new legislation.  It is appalling that large profits are being made by those running direct provision centres while people cannot work or cook their own food.  There have many discussions in the House regarding our obligations to children.  Surely we will not distinguish between children based on the colour of their skin or country.  I know the Minister of State is not the type of Minister to do that, but that is exactly what is happening in our policies.  We are distinguishing between people because they are behind closed doors which means we do not have to look at them.<\/p> <p> There is a narrative that money is being thrown at these people.  They have come to our country seeking refuge, as Irish people did elsewhere in the past.  We are giving adults and children &euro;19.10 and &euro;15.60, respectively, per week and calling that humanity.  On top of that, we are creating many problems for the future, as the Minister of State knows.  If we were to try living like that, what effect would it have on our physical and mental health, not to mention that of the children in the system?<\/p> <p> The pilot project was introduced in 2015 to allow certain residents to go to university.  I would like to know how many have fulfilled the criteria involved.  They are very restricted &ndash; I understand an applicant must have been in direct provision for five years and attended a school for a minimum of five years.  I ask the Minister of State to outline how many people have qualified under the rules.<\/p> <p> From many of the discussions we have had in the D&aacute;il, the Minister of State appears to be a very concerned Minister.  How can he stand over direct provision, which was introduced as a temporary measure in 2000?  Why not set a date to end it?  It could be his legacy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000010#H00300","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490868900,"counter":53,"content":"<p>It is very difficult to know what is going on.  The Government has stated it will accept refugees.  I asked what agency will deal with the people involved and where they will be housed.  It was stated that local authorities would be responsible for housing the refugees concerned.  The local authority for which I worked for many years does not have the required houses, facility or staff to deal with refugees and no extra staff have been deployed to cater for them.<\/p>  <p>  The refugees we have agreed to accept and those in direct provision are all human beings.  It is not right for a mother, father, teenagers and babies to be living in one room.  An asylum seeker could be in the country for seven, eight or nine years, but all they are entitled to is &euro;19.10 a week, which is not right.<\/p>  <p>  It was promised that the direct provision system would cease and the time involved in deciding on a person's status reduced.  Many people have been waiting for eight or nine years, which is not right and should not be happening.  A limit of five years was promised to decide whether a person can stay or must leave the country.  I ask that the system be reviewed.  Having one family in one room, in particular those with growing children, is not right.  We have to deal with the issue.  Those involved are human beings.<\/p>  <p>  It is grand to hear the Taoiseach agree to accept 4,000 or 5,000 refugees, but he must make provision for them in terms of housing.  Local authorities are stretched.  Some people in Kerry have been on housing lists for 12 or 14 years, some of whom were refugees or asylum seekers.  They must get priority.  If we are agreeing to accept refugees this year, the Government needs to tell us where housing is available and have a dedicated group of housing officers in place. <\/p>  <p>  Staff in our local authority are vetting people and trying to find houses for them.

I welcome the visitors in the Gallery.<\/p>  <p>  The system of direct provision for asylum seekers is almost 17 years old and from the beginning it has been a cause of significant controversy and debate.  Among the issues raised most recently are the duration of the stay in direct provision, the impact of this on family life, as Deputy Healy-Rae mentioned, children, oversight and monitoring and the right to work.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the Joint Committee on Public Services Oversight and Petitions stated the system is not fit for purpose and recommended that it be replaced.  The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, has a lovely name but behind it are abject failures.  It oversees the direct provision system on behalf of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The latest available RIA report revealed that there is a continual increase in the number of single males seeking asylum and availing of the offer of accommodation and referred to the opening of new centres to manage this influx.<\/p>  <p>  From a humanitarian perspective, we are duty bound to offer whatever assistance we can to those genuinely in need of asylum and ensure those who enter the direct provision system are treated with dignity and respect.  It is a duty of the State under any human rights charter, never mind international human rights charters.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Healy-Rae said, the Taoiseach needs to think things through when he agrees to accept refugees without considering all of the other issues involved.  That is paramount.  The human person must be at the centre of all of our laws.  We are failing people and we have seen how we failed them in the past.  If people are genuinely fleeing persecution and seeking refuge here, we need to extend our compassion and put into action the principles we spend so much time talking about.<\/p><p>Talk is easy and talk is cheap.  It is appalling to read reports that some children spend almost their entire childhood in these centres in the direct provision system.  It is incarceration, nothing less.  Prisoners are treated better.  This must end.<\/p> <p> I recently submitted a parliamentary question to the T&aacute;naiste seeking the number of children who have been born to those in the direct provision system since its introduction in 2000.  I received a reply from the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, that the information I had requested is not readily available as it is not collated by either the Department of Justice and Equality or the Registrar General of births, marriages and deaths.  That is outrageous.  I am not blaming the Minister of State for that but it is outrageous that we cannot tell the number of newborns in the centres.  It is scandalous.  It is extraordinary when one thinks about it.  Presumably those children born to those in the asylum process are de facto part of that process, yet we have no data or numbers available.  What is going on?  Who are the RIA?  We got rid of the IRA and we have agencies like this which are simply not fit for purpose.  It cannot record that.  Does it even know how many people are in the centres?  My God.<\/p> <p> However, while our humanitarian duty is clear, so also is the duty to the security of the State.  The issue of oversight and monitoring and how the applications process is managed is critically important.  We cannot bury our heads in the sand and pretend our asylum system, just like those in most European countries, is not open to abuse and violation.  Of course it is.  There are those who will seek to enter this State through the asylum system and who will not have our best interests at heart.  Of course we must not confuse these people with the genuine asylum seeker, but the ones we have here and have had here since 2000, surely we would have learned at this stage, 17 years later, how to look after them.  We must not be so innocent as to believe all applicants are genuine.  The direct provision system, as part of the overall asylum process, certainly needs to become more robust, even as it seeks to become more fair.<\/p> <p> The number of asylum seekers accommodated by the RIA on 31 December 2015 was 4,696, an increase of 332 persons or 7.6% on the same date in 2014.  This is the second year-on-year increase in seven years.  The RIA spent &euro;57.025 million on accommodation for asylum seekers in 2015, an increase of 4.7% on 2014.  I know and we all know that there are some unscrupulous private entrepreneurs, some who have bought up hotels and places that are in despicable condition, and there are people incarcerated there.  Worse than that, they entered into contracts.  I know of one place in my own area, that they never came to.  There were huge objections, unfortunately, 17 years ago but a contract was signed with an individual for ten years.  It was in the village of Clogheen in County Tipperary.  Why do they have to sign contracts?  Why not have a breakout clause after a year in case there are unscrupulous and unsuitable people who pretend to care but who only want a quick buck?  Surely to God the system is not so useless and so fatigued that there cannot be checks and balances, that we cannot check out after a year or two whether the accommodation is suitable, and that there would be a breaking clause in the contract rather than having to buy it out.  This is kindergarten stuff.  Children would not write these contracts.<\/p> <p> As the migrant crisis continues to show no signs of abating, we can be sure that the costs and numbers of applicants within our asylum process will remain similar and more than likely increase in the coming years.  In September of last year, I asked the Minister another parliamentary question about the number of forced deportations that were taking place.  In her reply, the Minister noted that the overwhelming majority of persons who arrive at the frontiers of the State without permission to enter or reside here are refused leave to land without ever reaching the stage where they would be considered under the deportation process.  She went on to say that the number of people arriving in this way rose substantially to almost 3,500 in 2015 and was expected to exceed 4,000 in 2016.  They are frightening figures.  Approximately 3,000 people removed or deported from Ireland in 2011, 2,200 in 2012, 2,700 in 2013, 3,790 in 2014 and 3,790 in 2015.  According to the Department of Justice and Equality, the people who were refused entry or deported came mainly from five countries.  The top countries of origin in percentage terms of deportation or removal are Albania, 9.2%, Brazil, 9.6%, Nigeria, 7.5%, South Africa, 7.4% and Pakistan 6%.<\/p> <p> In September 2015, I also asked the Minister for Justice and Equality if she would address concerns around a designation of a hotel in Clonea Strand as an emergency reception and orientation centre.  This was another farce which involved a wonderful tourist facility and which caused a rumpus in the village.  I do not believe that anyone went to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000011#J00300","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490869500,"counter":56,"content":"<p>It is full.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000012#K00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1490869500,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Since when?

It is very close to me, and I will be taking a walk along the strand and I will see and come back to him.  I will accept if I am wrong.  It was always full with people - holiday-makers and locals - but there was nobody in it when I was around there last July and August.  The gates were locked and the doors closed.  The concerns were brought to me by the local people who were deeply frustrated by the lack of engagement with them before the decision was made.  That was the RIA again.  It is like the NRA.  It is all-powerful and listens to no one.  As I said, we disbanded the IRA but we got a lot of agencies afterwards that we need peace processes or some sort of talks to get rid of them.  We have quango after quango which are not accountable to anyone, either the Oireachtas, the Minister or anyone else other than themselves, and they get fine hefty cheques and fine hefty retirement packages.<\/p><p>As part of the reply I received, I was told that in such cases, potential centres are assessed from a number of perspectives, including access to local amenities, the provision of State services and suitability of the accommodation for its particular purposes.  To return to Clonea, the Minister of State probably knows it.  He is only up the road on the same coastline.  With all those people we saw out on the sea, and I salute the Naval Service, the ships that were out there and the rescues they made, I would have thought the last place those people would want to rest would be beside the sea with the fright and the terror they encountered crossing it.  Remember Clonea village has no shops, no recreation and no infrastructure, so someone was codding someone there.  I would have thought that it would be the last place, just from a human perspective.  I am not saying that I am knowledgeable in this area but after such a terrorising trip across the sea, with some being rescued but so many drowned, I would have thought it would be the last place they would want to be sleeping or resting, that they would want to be in a place where they could not even hear the sea, and that they would want to be on <i>terra firma, <\/i>isteach san t&iacute;r, inland.  Someone would want to put on their thinking cap and see what is going on there.<\/p><p>There is not one single mention of local engagement.  I know this was for a refugee centre which is not strictly the same as the asylum centres but I want to note how important it is that we bring a community with us when we are attempting to progress this matter in a manner that is fair to all concerned.  I know the Minister of State engaged with people in Roscommon who are now on board, but again they had not been engaged with properly before.  What is wrong with the system here that we cannot hold a public meeting, meet the different agencies, talk to the people and bring them with us?  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  Together we stand, divided we fall.  We have all this Big Brother, this arm of the law.  We have officials who are unelected and unaccountable to anyone, who make these decisions and frighten people, and then the image goes out of a local community that is anti-asylum seeker when nothing could be further from the truth.  Consultation is very important.  If we are building a hen house or a shed, we have to get planning permission and put a notice up on the ditch, but these officials can do anything they want to do.  They ride in roughshod like John Wayne into Cong in that film he made in the west with Maureen O'Hara.  This is reckless.

Direct provision was only ever intended to be a short-term response but it has since become a national disgrace.  There is no disagreement with that assessment.  If the current system cannot provide decisions within the six months that were initially envisioned, direct provision is not fit for purpose.  The Government must accept responsibility for this and act.  From the contributions we have heard this morning, it is clear this is not a controversial view.  Everyone agrees.  We all want the Government to act, as the quality of life of those currently living in direct provision will not be improved by us making statements about the system's flaws.  We need political action.<\/p> <p> We need a more radical reform of our immigration system as a whole.  For the time being, though, addressing the conditions for people currently held in direct provision must be the Government's priority.  The recommendations of the McMahon report contained a number of practical steps to improve the system.  To her credit, the T&aacute;naiste has implemented the majority of those recommendations.  However, some of the ones that could have the greatest impact on quality of life remain outstanding.<\/p> <p> It goes without saying that basic resources like access to cooking facilities and private living spaces are fundamental to family life and well-being.  The McMahon report recommended that this should be the norm in all centres by the end of 2016.  Well into 2017, though, fewer than half of the accommodation centres under contract have some form of personal catering and it appears that the facilities on offer are far from consistent across the country.<\/p> <p> In the progress table that the T&aacute;naiste released, the Reception and Integration Agency did not respond to the recommendation that all requests for tender should specify the requirement for self-contained units and family quarters.  This was particularly troubling, given the highly flexible terms of the contracts made with the providers.  That requirement for basic family accommodation should have been a key element of the contracts awarded.<\/p> <p> According to the Comptroller and Auditor General, these contracts did not include measurable outputs.  Instead, they merely stated that accommodation must meet a standard that was reasonable having regard to the daily needs of asylum seekers.  That is too vague.  It must be borne in mind that these companies are commercial providers.  Between 2011 and 2015, they were paid a total of &euro;287 million, which is a vast amount of money.  In the same period, nine companies were each paid in excess of &euro;10 million.  It seems that the only ones benefitting from direct provision are the companies running the centres.  It is the nature of such companies to put their profit margins above the quality of their services.  If the Government intends to continue with the privatisation of this care, it must ensure greater oversight of these facilities and enforce a standard level of quality throughout the system.<\/p> <p> For too long, the State has kept these facilities at arm's length, choosing to ignore that the people they hold are a part of our communities.  Nor does the State's responsibility to them end when they are granted leave to remain.  As of last August, one in six residents in direct provision had been granted refugee status, subsidiary protection or leave to remain but had nowhere else to go.  In our alternative budget, the Social Democrats proposed allocating &euro;600,000 to provide for a multidisciplinary team to support individuals and families to transition from direct provision.  We remain strongly of that view.<\/p> <p> Rather than sharing the kind words and moral outrage about direct provision, what is needed from the Government is clear political action.  Regardless of how or why someone comes to our country seeking asylum, failing to ensure that he or she is afforded a basic level of dignity and respect betrays the very decency that is so fundamental to our national identity.  We need action quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000012#K01200","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490870100,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Labour Party in this debate.  I agree with Deputy Shortall's last point, in that we need action on and the full implementation of the McMahon report.  The first independent working group to examine and identify improvements in the system, it was established in October 2014 because the matter had been made a priority by the previous Government.  My colleague, Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, led the work on that priority.  The report was published in July 2015 and signed off on by a number of NGOs and Departments, including the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>I do not doubt the intentions, work and commitment of the Minister of State as regards the implementation of the McMahon report but it needs to be implemented in full and acted upon.  This is particularly so in terms of people who have been in direct provision for a long time.  There are terrible stories of people who, having been there for years upon years, despair of ever getting their lives back.  We need to acknowledge the progress that has been made.  A large number of those who have been in direct provision for a long time have had their cases handled, but we need to reach the target of that not taking more than six months, which has not been achieved in respect of many people.<\/p><p>The issue of living conditions is important.  We are referring to people's human rights.  The Minister of State outlined that there had been progress to some extent, for example, cooking facilities and more space for families, but I have a clear picture in my head of a family that I visited in Knockalisheen, which is in County Clare but near Limerick city.  A mother, father and two children were in a single tiny room with the children sitting on the bed trying to do their homework.  There have been some improvements, but not everywhere.  We need urgent action in this regard.<\/p><p>A statement was published by the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children just before I entered the Chamber indicating their offices would be available to people in direct provision from Monday next.  That is to be welcomed and was one of the McMahon recommendations.  The Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, stated:<\/p><blockquote>Children in Direct Provision will now have equal access to the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office.  This will enable my Office to make a constructive contribution to the overall welfare of children living in Direct Provision accommodation.  Young people in Direct Provision can now be assured that there is a safe, secure and independent place they can come to make a complaint.<\/blockquote><p>While access to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is important, children should not have to live in direct provision and their families' applications should be dealt with speedily.  This access must also apply to children whose cases have been completed but who are still in direct provision because their families have nowhere to go after being granted asylum or leave to remain.  These practical issues need to be addressed urgently.  The McMahon report must be fully implemented.<\/p><p>I will pick up on Deputy Connolly's point on access to higher education.  As the Minister for Education and Skills, I was tasked with implementing the recommendation that young people should have access to higher education.<\/p><p>As such, we brought in a scheme on foot of the direct recommendation in the McMahon report and I have met people who have been able to attend universities and institutes of technology as a result.  If, however, the scheme is not capturing the number of young people who are in school and are deprived of that opportunity and, as such, it needs to be reviewed, it should be.  From personal experience, I know that there are many people who would love to have the opportunity to access education and jobs.<\/p> <p> The most effective thing we can do is ensure that cases are dealt with swiftly and that people are provided with their full entitlements where they qualify for leave to remain and-or asylum in the State.  The system has been broken and it does not serve the needs of some who are in the most desperate situations.  That is what brings them to our country and we need to treat them with dignity and respect and to implement fully the recommendations of the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000013#L00200","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490870700,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Sin deireadh.

By any stretch of the imagination, it was a sad day for Europe and it is very worrying and will have major ramifications for the citizens of this island.  It has been described in some of the newspapers this morning as not just a storm for Ireland but an earthquake.  While the EU member states will be negotiating the terms of Brexit over the next two years and maybe longer, it is a fact that Ireland will be the country that loses most from this deal.<\/p>  <p>  The British Government seems to be determined to fly the Union Jack more and more while singing \"Rule Britannia\".  At the same time, it is saying it wants the most amicable and lovable divorce in the history of divorces.  Citizens across our island, North and South, are genuinely worried about the ramifications of Brexit and how it would seem Ireland has very little influence on the actual outcome.  People are worried about the Government not being prepared enough, despite flying around from capital city to capital city, stating our case.  However, in the six-page letter yesterday, the importance of not returning to hard borders was mentioned, as was the peace process, which was given priority.  The Good Friday Agreement is, after all, an international agreement which has to be upheld.  The comments in regard to the common travel area, while welcome, refer to a system in place since the 1920s.<\/p>  <p>  What is really worrying from yesterday is that Chancellor Merkel responded to Prime Minister May by slapping down any parallel talks on trade while the negotiations are ongoing.  The UK is traditionally our largest trading partner and we trade &euro;1.2 billion in goods and services every week.  Department of Finance officials have already stated that Ireland could face a 30% decline in exports to the UK and a significant rise in unemployment.  We all agree the agri-food industry is the most significant industry, employing people right across the country.  Exports will be impacted upon, as will trade between North and South.  Over 800 million litres of milk are imported from the North annually and we export and import thousands of cattle to the North.<\/p>  <p>  All of these statistics are impacting on consumer confidence as the British are already talking up trade deals between the US, Canada and South American countries.  The Minister will come back and say the Government is prepared.  How can he say we are prepared, particularly in regard to agri-food industry, when Bord Bia, the agency charged by the State and the Government with selling our industry, has only employed an extra three staff in its Brexit section?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000015#N00200","speaker":"1283"},{"type":"speech","time":1490871000,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I take the opportunity to express my sympathy on behalf of the Government to the family of the late Captain Mark Duffy, whose funeral is today and in whose memory the flag is flying at half mast.  We also hope the other two families who are anxiously waiting will not have to wait long.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Moynihan for his question.  I can assure him the Government has entered into very long preparation for the event that occurred yesterday.  This is certainly not of our choosing, I agree with him on that front, but we have done very deep sectoral SWOT analyses and looked at the strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats.  The Deputy is right that there are threats to some sectors and opportunities in others.  We have revised our trade strategy and job strategy and we have strengthened all of the agencies so they will be in a position to assist companies to diversify, train, adopt lean mechanisms, be more competitive in their markets and trade online.  Many changes are being supported by our agencies to ensure companies are in a position to compete.<\/p>  <p>  We have set out our priorities very clearly.  Not only that, but we have a very clear track record.  The Deputy will recall that, in the last six years, when economic trading conditions in Europe were the most difficult for decades, this Government adopted policies which helped grow employment by 2% per annum.  We have 200,000 extra people back at work.  That has been an export-led recovery based on stronger competitiveness and more diversification of our markets.  We are in a strong position to deal with this decision by the United Kingdom.<\/p>  <p>  We have secured support not just in Theresa May's letter, where very clearly one can see the Government's priorities reflected, but in that Michel Barnier has also indicated frequently his consciousness of Irish concerns.  Those concerns have been very clearly set out by Government.  We are preparing for the twists and turns of a very difficult negotiation.  This is not a straightforward single line of travel.  It will be very difficult and there will be issues that we will have to reflect on as they come.  However, we have put ourselves in a very strong position, both with regard to our influence with key European partners among the 27, with Michel Barnier and the negotiating team and, indeed, with the British.  We are prepared to participate to the full in these discussions and negotiations, which will have a profound impact on our country but which will also offer opportunities as well and we are equally prepared to seize those opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000015#N00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1490871000,"counter":80,"content":"<p>On behalf of my party, I would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the family of Captain Mark Duffy and to all those involved in that horrendous accident.<\/p>  <p>  I do not think the agri-food industry will take much solace from what the Minister has said.  There is a huge industry out there and it is very important to note the talk-up by the British Government in regard to supposed trade deals with the US, Canada and South America.  We have seen in recent days that the quality of food being produced in some of these countries leaves a lot to be desired.  The Irish agricultural industry has built enormously over the past 25 years and goes back centuries.  It has prided itself on following the regulations stringently to produce one of the best and safest food industries in the world.  Despite Bord Bia being the agency of the State that is charged with marketing our products, it has only four extra key officials in light of Brexit.  The Minister said the Government was strengthening the agencies.

That approach has been very successful.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is right that the agricultural sector is one of those sectors most exposed because it has traditionally had a very high dependence on the UK market.  We have to support our companies to diversify, which we will do, but we also need to secure in these negotiations the protection of the standards which the Deputy rightly says Europe values.  I can assure him that not just Ireland but Europe will be determined to protect the high standards of food which are vital to quality for consumers and the workings of our markets.

Six days into their strike action, those workers are furious, frustrated and bewildered.  Yesterday, inside the gates, the man who has the responsibility for this dispute to be resolved in a fair way, the Minister, Deputy Ross, was once again telling the Oireachtas transport committee that he will not intervene and will not do his job.  He is happy to hide away in his office and sit on his hands while travel chaos unfolds all around communities who depend on the services of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It is as though he found the entrance into Narnia and only pops back through the wardrobe every now and then to remind us of just how incompetent he is.<\/p>  <p>  It is time for the Minister, Deputy Ross, to grow up.  The invisible transport Minister is so hell-bent on pursuing his mission for privatisation that he is clearly oblivious to the fury of the workers and the exasperation of passengers throughout the State.  Those workers who have children to feed and rent or mortgages to pay fear losing between 20% and 30% of their incomes.  Passengers cannot get to work, to hospital appointments or to visit family members who rely upon their support.  The crisis in the public transport network is causing hardship, stress and disarray.  That is the fault of this Minister and the Government.  The public is boiling with anger and rightly so.  It is very important that this anger be directed at the right people and directed at those responsible.  Those responsible are the Minister, Deputy Ross, the Government and the management at Bus &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>  <p>  The workers who stood on Kildare Street yesterday are taking a brave stand against a blatant attack on their livelihoods and against the dismantling of a public service.  It is not easy to be on strike.  It is not easy for Bus &Eacute;ireann workers to be on strike, but what choice do they have when faced with a Minister who is absolutely intent on shutting down Bus &Eacute;ireann as a public service?  We now have the ludicrous situation in which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport - the person responsible for keeping Ireland moving - is willingly presiding over transport grinding to a halt.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, is actually sabotaging the transport network and this cannot be allowed.  His position of non-intervention and his flimsy excuses cut no ice, neither with the public nor with the workers.  I have a simple question.

This week, my party published a Brexit policy paper containing 20 specific concrete actions aimed at protecting the Irish economy in the face of the real challenges that are now on their way.  Changing the fiscal rules is one of them.  Also this week, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and IBEC have called for specific policy actions.

What is required now are not the generalisms that I already heard this morning from the Minister but concrete actions that will be taken.  We have put out sensible policy proposals that will make a difference.  We are calling for increased investment in a targeted programme to support companies in sectors like agrifoods, which were mentioned already.  Among the 20 proposals are a &euro;250 million Brexit trade adjustment fund, the suspension of state aid rules for two years after the UK leaves the EU, an early warning system that encompasses business, trade unions and other stakeholders and a new regional action plan in the Minister's old area of jobs to take the new reality of Brexit on board.<\/p><p>Since last year I have raised the issue of the European globalisation adjustment fund a number of times and we still have no progress on that.

What contingency plans are in place, particularly for a hard Border and dealing with customs checks at our ports and our airports?  Is the Government preparing to strengthen our transport links, especially our links to mainland Europe, and invest in our ports, and are there specific strategies to deal with these matters?  We are calling for specific recognition of the unique challenges faced by Ireland in the negotiating mandate from the European Council to be provided by the European Commission, with the team to be lead by Michel Barnier.  Specifically, does the Government support special status for Northern Ireland, which is a matter which has already been voted upon by this House?

It revolves around supporting continued North-South co-operation and protecting the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  All of those have been detailed to a considerable degree, and we have had an all-Ireland civic forum to ensure all points of view are provided for.  We have very specific provisions also in terms of a job strategy, with Enterprise Ireland and IDA provisions.  We have a capital plan which is being reviewed by the Minister, and it will be very conscious of the infrastructure requirements that will arise from Brexit.  We have revised our trade strategy very specifically to look at diversification to the markets where we have the opportunity to grow, anticipating that it will not be so easy in the UK market and that we cannot be so reliant upon it.<\/p>  <p>  I applaud Deputy Howlin's efforts to look afresh at the European Union.  I share his view that we need to make sure that the Union, in the future, has a far greater focus on the needs of citizens and delivering for citizens against a backdrop where we have seen a number of faultlines exposed within the structures of the EU in recent years.  It is a sad situation that Europe has lost much of the commitment of ordinary people because it has been mired in trying to resolve its issues.  It is very important that we start to look to the future.  That debate is starting within the EU.  The paper recently issued by the Commission is a first start.  Perhaps it is not bold enough for any of us, but it begins to open up that debate.  There will be a big obligation not just to negotiate the exit of Britain, but beginning later this year, to shape the new Europe that we want to see.

This mess must be cleaned up.  Has the Government considered, or will it consider, legislative changes to deal with those wrongful 14,700 convictions?  Rather than have to go to court on an individual case-by-case basis which would clog up our courts and be hugely expensive and difficult for the litigants involved, could we not introduce a legislative amendment where all 14,700 would be scheduled and listed as an amendment to the legislation?  This would allow for them to be quashed in a single legislative move, which would then allow us to move on to fix the redress which might arise in any particular cases.  Has the Government considered such a legislative provision in its Cabinet meeting this week so that we at least deal with those cases in a timely, quick, cheap and efficient manner?<\/p>  <p>  A key question I have concerns the Government's decision that the way to respond to this is another inquiry into the future of the Garda.  What is the purpose of such an inquiry when we have the likes of the Olson report, completed in November 2015, entitled Changing Irish Policing, which to my reading gives a very clear analysis of the difficulties we have and gives very clear direction on what needs to be done?  Why are we commissioning yet more studies into what might be done when we have, it seems to me, a perfectly well-written, incisive, articulate and clear report that could very quickly provide us with a range of actionable items?  It is particularly shocking that Deputy Commissioner Twomey, in the last meeting of the Policing Authority, said that one of the main recommendations in terms of employing staff in Castlebar on the data communications system has not yet been put in place.  It was also shocking to hear the Commissioner say this morning that she has only now got the team she needs in place in terms of additional assistant commissioners.  What is it in the public administrative system that is restricting us from being able to be flexible and fast in terms of moving people around and putting people in the right positions?  Especially in this case the public system seems unable to provide this flexibility.  I do not know whether it is a Garda problem or whether it applies to other areas of the public service.  Why is it still taking us a year or two to get there?  What both Deputy Commissioner Twomey and Commissioner O'Sullivan said is that they could not do it because they did not have authorisation to employ the necessary people.  Why is our public administrative system so slow to put the people in the right place?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000017#P00500","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1490872200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>It is true to say that there is a lot of executive action changing things.

There is a whole range of things that are being implemented.  The difficulty we have is that we are on a painful journey of reform and what we have seen in the last few days demonstrates that some of the cultural issues within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have not been resolved by the programme of reform.  I took note of the Garda Inspectorate's reports and agree there is a huge amount of recommendations therein to be implemented.  We now have a Policing Authority, just one year in position, which is taking on a stronger role.  We are on a journey of reform but there is no doubt that what we have seen today has shaken peoples' confidence in the way the system is working.  <\/p> <p> The Deputy has asked what a new review could do but this will not be a review like those of the past, where we looked specifically at whistleblowers, at one district or one segment of Garda operations.  This will look at root and branch issues.  For example, should we separate security from policing, so that we could have a different approach to policing and different forms of accountability?  That has been discussed in the past.  Those issues are now on the table.  We recognise that cultural change within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will need more than just the approach that has been adopted to date.  That is not to say that many of the proposals in the Garda Inspectorate's reports and the proposals from the Policing Authority are not on the right track.  However, when we turn up stones and find the scale of what happened on this occasion, we cannot just turn around and say it is business as usual and this will work.  This has exposed real problems and the Government feels that we must address them in a different way.  We must look at more serious structural issues as well as the ones that are already being addressed.  That is why we are open to discussing, not just within Government but with other interested parties, the way in which we should structure this.  It will not protect us from other issues being found out but we must have confidence that we have a structure that will deal with those issues as they arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000017#P00600","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490872800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I agree that we need to look at the cultural background in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that allowed this to take place.

However, we also have a structural problem in our Government and public administration system.  When senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are asked questions in public fora, such as at today's meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and the last meeting of the Policing Authority, as to why the clear recommendations - that we spent a lot of time formulating - on the immediate employment of the right people to start addressing problems have not been implemented, the answer we get is that they could not do that because they were not authorised to put the staff in place.  We got rid of the employment control framework four years ago, which was a deeply damaging piece of administrative structuring.  Why is it then that we still seem to have an inability to be flexible and to allow agencies to employ people quickly?

We want to give the people who will be using these centres every chance that this will help their health and might also encourage them into recovery at some point.  We know there are certain areas in this city and outside the city that would not for one second tolerate any kind of addiction centre being anywhere near them.  That is why we need to keep a close eye on this.  It is the responsibility of the Oireachtas to have a role to ensure the centres are effective and that there are high standards of individual public health and safety.  I am not taking from any of the addiction services which may apply to have the injecting rooms in their centre.  I accept that this is innovative, inventive and totally new and I want it to work.  That is why I want it to have every opportunity to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000029#EE00700","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1490879100,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan in her request for a review of this legislation on a two-yearly basis.  I raised this matter on Committee Stage and I thought the Minister of State might have listened and given some sense of comfort in regard to this whole new idea.  I wish to state that I support the concept of helping people with drug problems.  As I said on Committee Stage, I have lived with a methadone centre just down the road from my constituency office.  Despite various pressures I came under over the years, I have supported the retention of that centre.<\/p>  <p>  This is a totally new ball game and it is very questionable in terms of how people get drugs in the first instance.  They have to bring illegal drugs, as is made clear in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.  Therefore, there is a whole area of questioning as to the actual operation of this legislation.  We are asking people to close an eye to illegal drugs being purchased outside these centres and brought in to be consumed inside.  Whatever about relieving the liability on anybody about the consumption of those drugs in one of these centres, it still begs the question about drugs dealers on the streets outside selling drugs to people who are using the facility.<\/p>  <p>  I am a pragmatist and I know that drugs are going to be got, but this is legislation which we are responsible for as legislators.  Therefore, I think the very minimum we should do is to have a clause in the legislation to review the situation after a two-year period.  I would like to support Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.  I had mentioned this on Committee Stage, including the two-year period.  It is not that people want to be heartless or soulless in terms of dealing with this terrible issue but we, as legislators, have a responsibility to be able to answer questions.  We cannot put through legislation that has a big question mark over it.  There is a huge question mark in respect of this Bill because we cannot, or at least I cannot, answer the question if asked about allowing people to buy illegal drugs from drug dealers out in the street because there is no other way they can get them.<\/p>  <p>  There are serious issues to be addressed.  However, if one questions any of these things, one is seen to be unsympathetic to what is sought to be achieved here.  My ambition is that these centres would eventually lead to people getting off drugs.  Again, however, the legislation does not include anything about the availability of people in these centres to give help and assistance to drug users to get off drugs.  Maybe that can be done by way of regulation but it is not in the legislation, and we have to look at what is before us.  We need a provision whereby we can review this legislation, whether annually or every two years.  To be realistic, I feel we would have to give a reasonable period of, say, two years so that people can then sit and coldly look at how this is working.  Information I have received recently suggests that some of the countries - particularly New Zealand - in which these centres are already in place are having a rethink in respect of them.<\/p>  <p>  Be that as it may, we are dealing with our situation.  I do not think we would damage the legislation in any way by allowing the House to review matters after two years in order to see how it is working.  Therefore, without creating any difficulties, I think it is reasonable that we should agree to a review after two years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000029#EE00800","speaker":"1219"},{"type":"speech","time":1490879100,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I have supported this legislation from the start.  Although I have not been engaged with it in committee, I remember the furore that arose and the upset that was caused to some people when methadone clinics were first proposed throughout the city.  However, the world did not stop.  Nonetheless, there were teething problems and some of the latter will again arise in respect of this initiative.  One teething problem was that people were coming from outside an area to avail of a service that was offered to them.  Unless these supervised facilities are rolled out across the country, there will be people who will come from outside, along with the baggage they sometimes bring with them.  That is one of the concerns and, obviously, it is a concern that can be dealt with when the regulations are put in place for the licence, in that whoever gets the licence can start to address who exactly the facility is targeted at.<\/p>  <p>  The point the previous speaker made in terms of support services is very valid.  I presume that any facility which applied for a licence would have to be one that has all of those support services available.<\/p><p>If somebody who is using a facility decides at that stage that he or she wants additional supports, that must be available as near as possible to the injecting facility.<\/p> <p> I do not think we should be afraid, as I have argued in respect of much legislation in the House, of having a review or referring it at the very least to the D&aacute;il committee that has expertise on it.  While the D&aacute;il committee can do that anyway, it would be reasonable for the matter to arise there.  There will be consequences to these measures and hopefully they will have the desired effects, are successful and can be rolled out.  At the end of the day, this is aimed at protecting the health of the public in general and in particular those who are availing, whether we like it or not, of illegal drugs and injecting them.  A variety of different concoctions are being injected at this very moment and it is not just what most people presume is heroin.  We saw that in particular when the head shops existed.  People were mixing every single type of chemical possible and we saw the effects that had in the accident and emergency rooms across the country.  The doctors did not understand how to treat them because they were not aware of what was going into the person.  At least if there are supervised injecting centres, they might have quicker information as to what may have been injected in order that they can address some of the side effects of these drugs if people present in accidents and emergency departments.<\/p> <p> I think the amendment is reasonable enough.  It is not a repeal of the Act every two years.  In some cases, that is what people want.  This is just to try and strengthen it.  It might be just a once-off, but in two years' time we will have the first two years' experience.  From that, we will have learned a lot and will be able to tighten up the legislation and the regulations and licence that pertain to it.  The main thing is that we learn.  Whichever are the pilot facilities, the ones that are granted a licence thereafter will be able to learn from the first ones into the breach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000029#EE00900","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490879700,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I hear the points Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and &Oacute; Snodaigh have made.

I do not think we should fear the D&aacute;il discussing this every two years or having a report come before it with regard to how it is working, what the issues might be and how we can make it work better in the context of rehabilitation and harm reduction.  I am not sure why there is an attempt to exclude from this legislation the opportunity for the D&aacute;il to make the regulations that underpin it more effective for the people this Bill is trying to help.  We all know there are a lot of legislative items on which a Minister must report to the D&aacute;il on an annual basis or every two years with regard to various health matters.  It is recorded in the D&aacute;il.  Sometimes there is a debate and sometimes there is not.  The amendment is worthy of consideration.  We are not changing the thrust of this Bill; we are just saying that the D&aacute;il could potentially make it better.  Without leaving executive control completely in the Bill, we are saying that the D&aacute;il could have a discussion every two years to make it work better and see how it is doing.  It would also be an opportunity to improve the legislation and regulations for the very people we are trying to help.  I think it is a very reasoned and fair amendment.

I have not been a participant in the debates on this Bill to date but I am very supportive of the legislation.  I believe it is a significant step forward in a progressive direction to have supervised injecting facilities and to try to create a safer environment for people with addiction problems in which to inject.  I would not support any amendment that would cast doubt over the value of moving in this direction rather than having things driven underground into parks, alleyways, subways or wherever it is.  However, I do not think that is the purpose of this amendment.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that we discuss this on a regular basis, see how it is going, monitor it closely and try to improve things as we go along.  We are entering, for this country at least, into new territory, and it is good territory as far as I am concerned.  It is territory that brings something out of the shadows, acknowledges the reality of it and tries to address it.  I believe it is a sensible amendment.<\/p>  <p>  It might set a precedent for other debates of a similar nature that we are going to have in the next few weeks on the question of medicinal cannabis.  I know that in that area, the Government and possibly some others in the Opposition are going to express concern about potential implications and knock-on and spill-over effects, as they might see it, of decriminalising medicinal cannabis.  I do not share those concerns, but if, as I hope, the medicinal cannabis Bill passes, I suspect that the Government and those who have those concerns will propose an amendment just like this one and state that the House will need to constantly review matters to see what the impact, efficacy, benefits and shortcomings of it are.  I think that is a sensible approach.  It would therefore be inconsistent for the Government to oppose this amendment and to then, very likely, make the opposite argument in a few weeks' time when we come to debate another area of decriminalisation around particular drugs, during which the Government will argue for caution, monitoring and so on and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  I think the Minister should seriously consider this amendment and accept it.  There is nothing to lose.  There are no dangers in this.  It is just a sensible measure to ensure that this issue stays in focus and that we move from this positive step on a trajectory of making things better over time to address the reality of what is a fact of our society, that is, the injection of these drugs.  I hope the Government will accept the amendment.  Aside from the Government's concerns, everybody else in the House seems to share that view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000030#FF00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1490879700,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I wish to pick up on one or two points that have been made.  I share Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's concerns about communities that have been loaded in the past with facilities compared with other communities.  The direction of this supervised injection centre is all about where the need is greater.  That is why the HSE and the Department are engaged in a mapping process to try to identify where people are injecting and where people have left litter.  When the legislation comes into force, that will help to identify where exactly the location should be and will give those who are going to provide the service a real insight into where the centre should be located.  I certainly share some of Deputy O'Sullivan's concerns.  I hope that when the legislation is approved and when the people are ready to provide the service, it will be possible to consider many of these concerns during the consultation.  Where the need is greater, the services will be allocated.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to pick up on something that Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh knows a lot about this Bill, like a lot of Members here.<\/p><p>We do not anticipate there being a honey pot effect.  It does not happen in other countries and we are taking on board the experiences of other countries.  People are not attracted from far and wide but rather it deals with people in the location of the facility.<\/p> <p> The supervised needle injection facility is all about a health-lead approach.  It has to be, for those chronic people who are coming in off the street.  They are probably not in any other service, but as part of the service there will be doctors, nurses and clinical staff there, and there will be people able to forward users into other services.  That is the whole idea of this service.  It gives an opportunity to chronic users to be able to build up trust in the centre with the staff and to be able then if they wish to go further into their recovery.  That is what we all want as legislators.  A crucial part of the supervised injection service is that we have a wraparound service around it.  Otherwise I do not believe it will work.<\/p> <p> Regarding the amendment, I am advised that the amendment offered would not achieve what the Deputy intends.  The two yearly review of the legislation, rather than the outcomes of the centre, would be overly burdensome and could ultimately prevent the Bill achieving its goals.  I know this is not the intention of Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, who has been an advocate for injecting centres for many years and spoke so favourably about the Bill some weeks ago.<\/p> <p> I am advised that there is no similar provision on the Statute Book.  I understand that it may be the Deputy&rsquo;s intention to provide what is known as a sunset clause, where the law shall cease to have effect unless further legislative action is taken to extend it.  However, I have been advised that the amendment in this section does not achieve this and I cannot accept it.  I do not consider this measure to be necessary given that the Bill clearly sets out that any licence issued will be for a defined period of time.  The Minister is not obliged to grant a licence under the Bill.  Similarly the Minister is not obliged to renew a licence either.  However, under section 5 the Minister is empowered to suspend or revoke a licence.  This includes where the Minister is satisfied that the licence holder is no longer eligible to hold the licence or is breach of the conditions of the licence or any regulations made under the Act.  The Minister will consult with the HSE and the Garda and may bring issues to the attention of the Minster in this respect.<\/p> <p> As the Misuse of Drugs Acts currently stand, it is illegal to operate and use an injecting centre of any sort.  This Government has made a commitment to maintaining a health-lead rather than criminal justice approach to drug use.  It is our intention to open an injecting centre on a pilot basis in Dublin city centre where, as many Members have agreed, there is a problem of street injection and the related challenges such behaviour gives rise to.  We know the evidence internationally is very much in favour of injecting centres.  However, this pilot centre will be subject to a thorough evaluation in order to assess it in an Irish context and the ability of the centre to meet the needs of people who inject drugs in Ireland.  It will be evaluated to determine its safety, cost-effectiveness and benefits.  The results of this pilot project will inform decisions about any further injecting centres, including whether or not the pilot facility should continue to stay open.  These decisions will be based on the evidence.  The pilot centre will be subject to ongoing monitoring and review, with input from the Garda, the HSE and others.  While I expect the pilot centre to be a success, if for some reason it is not, then the Minister is not obliged to renew the licence or grant any other licence.  If the evidence does not support the pilot service continuing, or the ongoing monitoring process suggests that the centre is not operating as intended, then the Bill enables the Minister to revoke the licence.  In this way I do not see the need for any form of review clause in this Bill.  Licences and centres will be subject to regular and ongoing reviews and structured evaluation.<\/p> <p> We have witnessed this in other countries where a review of this nature became a hurdle to the work of the centre and was ultimately removed from the legislation.  This was despite the fact there was a huge amount of evidence to support the injecting centre there.<\/p> <p> There is no injection facility in New Zealand at the moment.  However, an injection centre will shortly be opening in Glasgow and one opened in Paris just before Christmas.  In Sydney, where there is an injection centre, authorities are returning to Parliament to look for another injection centre to be opened because the Bill at that time only sought one centre.  In this Bill we are looking at having facilities so that we will not have to come back seeking further legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000030#FF00400","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490880300,"counter":232,"content":"<p>When I hear the Oireachtas is not going to have any role in reviewing this it rings alarm bells, because we all know how little debate there has been here and how little discussion there has been about addiction, whether it is drugs, alcohol or gambling.  It is good that we are having this particular discussion today.  I do not remember too many debates.  There have been periods since I have been here that we did not have a Minister with specific responsibility for the drugs strategy, and there was a long gap before Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in took up the mantle in the last D&aacute;il.  Despite the Minister of State saying that she will have the power to suspend the licence, I have a fear that unless we have somebody who is particularly interested and dedicated to this area, someone who understands the issues, we could have a situation where any unintended consequences might go on for much longer than they would.  To me that would be detrimental to the work of the injecting centres.<\/p>  <p>  One thing I would love to see beside every injecting centre - I hope there will be more than one if the need is there - is a recovery caf&eacute;.  Great work is being undertaken by the recovery academy, and they are not on the agenda at all.  We have to show the examples and let it be visible that people are in recovery and that there are opportunities for people to go into recovery and to stay in recovery.  In other countries they have recovery business centres and recovery caf&eacute;s.  That would be very good.  It is not a \"Big Brother is watching\" type thing.  This is to make it better, and other people in the House, whoever they may be, at other stages who have an interest in this and who are concerned about it should have a continuous input.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned the methadone clinics.  There were unintended consequences and they are still going on.  People are spending far too long on methadone and they are not having the opportunity to reduce their use or to come off methadone completely.  We still have a lack of dignity for people who are visibly queueing up for methadone on the streets.  I would hate to see something like that happening at the injection centres.

For example, any of the Ombudsman Acts facilitate an ombudsman making a report to the D&aacute;il.  It is laid before the House.  In some instances they are to report to relevant committees.  I would not go down the road of a sunset clause because I do not believe that this should be repealed.  It should be reviewed by the Committee on Health.  It can be done without it being in the legislation.  It would be nice if it was contained within the legislation because that is a guarantee that it will happen, whether in the next D&aacute;il or the one after it.  At least then they are discussing the drugs issue and whether this pilot is successful or not.<\/p>  <p>  This is a pilot scheme and I welcome it and have no problem with it at all.  However, if the pilot goes on for three or four years, when will it be properly reviewed to see whether it will go on beyond the pilot?

If it is mainstream is another one piloted somewhere else? <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said the international evidence suggests that people do not come from too far away.

As was mentioned earlier, it is ten years since we signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and we have not yet ratified it.  The UN Convention which is the subject of the Bill before us today is even older.  I know that of the 124 states that are a party to it, only four have signed it but not yet ratified it and Ireland is one of those.  Last night I noted that similar legislation was passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly at the behest of my party colleague, Ms Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n when she was Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the Six Counties and it is timely that we are now following suit.  Hopefully this legislation will have good effect.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen throughout the world the effects of some of the most recent wars on UNESCO cultural institutions and heritage sites.  We have seen how different groups have specifically targeted the historical wealth that exists in this world that helps to explain to the public where we came from and to some extent, where we are going.  We have had our own history of that here.  Giraldus Cambrensis, also known as Gerald of Wales, wrote about Ireland long ago.  He denigrated the Irish and set out that they were a different race who should be set aside.  In today's parlance, his suggestion was that the Irish were second class, or even third class and somewhat akin to the caste system that operates in India, that we were worthless.  As we saw subsequently with the Statutes of Kilkenny and the Penal Laws, the conqueror often tries to destroy the identity of the conquered, to deny them their language, their history and their traditions.  <\/p><p>In those days, there would not have been as much built heritage.  In the past couple of hundred years, however, there is much more.  As we have seen from recent wars in the Middle East, some of that region's built heritage is much older than that in northern Europe.  Ireland has some built heritage, however, such as Newgrange, Knowth, Dowth and other major graves.  Structures such as D&uacute;n Aonghasa are built heritage, but built heritage of its era is not as common as it is in other parts of the world.  This is the type of built heritage we want to protect.<br\/><br\/>We want to protect the heritage of whole civilisations that no longer exist and that have left us a legacy.  The legacy might not be in writing but in the graphics on the side of caves.  The civilisations have left us a heritage of artefacts.  That is what this Bill is trying to capture, such that during a war the combatants do not target specifically for destruction artefacts that are 1,000 years old or regard them as the spoils of war to be robbed and expatriated to their country.  We have some expatriated artefacts in our museums here.  In England, there was a fight over the years to have certain artefacts repatriated to the countries from which they were stolen in the first place.  Artefacts were often taken when soldiers were pillaging, or there was a systematic attempt to rid countries a wealth, perhaps through an imperialist power taking all the gold, be it in the form of an artefact or otherwise, and expatriating it and melting it down.  The Spanish and Portuguese did this with the wealth of the South Americans.  They destroyed gold material that was more than 1,000 years old at the time just to satisfy the greed of an empire.  It was melted down to make coins.<br\/><br\/>In preparation for this debate, I read Fintan O'Toole's article about the Reclining Buddha, a beautiful Buddha now in the National Museum of Ireland, where my father worked years ago.  It is imperial loot; that is specifically what it is.  Mr. O'Toole names the person responsible.  He states:<\/p><blockquote>Col Sir Charles Fitzgerald, an Irishman in the British army in India, stole it while on a punitive military expedition to Burma in 1885-6.  In 1891, Fitzgerald sent it, along with other looted Burmese statues, to the museum.<\/blockquote><p>What else is in our museums that should be repatriated or at least offered up to some of the countries in question?  In some ways, while we possess the objects we hold them illegally.  In this day and age, we could make facsimiles which would be just as good as the originals.  We could say that, for years, we held the original and that in some ways we held it in trust because we were not imperialists.  The Irish Government did not set out to rob the artefacts or pillage and plunder in other countries, but because our territory was part of the British empire, some museums and stately houses in Ireland have plundered artefacts as a consequence.  We should consider that.  If we are passing legislation such as this, it would be appropriate to have an audit of our museums to ascertain what we hold.<br\/><br\/>There was a long dispute over the Elgin Marbles in London.  The Egyptians were demanding their return.  It is an ongoing battle of which I am aware.  In the past, there have been requests to return many of the Korans held in museums in this State, such as the Chester Beatty Library.  Rather than holding on to artefacts that are not only religiously very valuable but also historically very valuable to the areas from which they originated, they might be returned.  Before doing so, we could make facsimiles.  There was an example of this in this House only recently.  The last portrait that was erected in this House is a facsimile of one from Westminster, a painting of the Irish parliamentarians  in Westminster entitled &quot;The Men who made Home Rule&quot;.  We do not have the original, yet the facsimile conveys the same message.  It is appropriate that we consider that when examining this matter.<br\/><br\/>Over the years in Ireland, we have not been as respectful as we should have been to our own built heritage.  I remember the controversy over the demolition of Frascati House in Blackrock when I was very young.  It became a Roches Stores supermarket for a while.  The house was the summer house of the Fitzgerald family, the family of the Earl of Kildare who owned Leinster House, yet it was demolished just to facilitate the building of a supermarket.<br\/><br\/>We all remember, with the possible exception of those younger than me, the destruction at Wood Quay.  The State is not always as protective as it should be.  This was in peacetime.  Think of what could be done during war.  With regard to Wood Quay, I remember my own brother going to the city dump and coming back with coins and a sword from the Viking period.  That was the scale of the destruction.  We cannot undo that.  In passing this legislation, we should not be hypocrites either.  We should make a bigger step to protect what we have.<br\/><br\/>It is welcome news that there is some progress on Moore Street.  There was a danger that the street, which is part of our built heritage, would be destroyed.  Maybe there is a greater understanding of the benefit of history to future generations, especially given the considerable interest last year in the history of the events of 1916.  People understood their importance and wanted to be associated with them.  We can build on that in regard to our history.  The same was true when we were commemorating the Famine of 1845 to 1850.  When we should never bulldoze history.<br\/><br\/>As I said, we should have an audit.  We should also ask the other signatories to audit what is held in their libraries and museums.  Many of the pillaged books that were in monasteries in Ireland ended up in the British libraries and were used as the covers for books.  The hardback covers were made up of old manuscripts or parchment from the works of monks throughout Ireland who transcribed and decorated religious works and also medical books.  They ended up being squashed together with glue and made into the hardback covers of many of the books in some of the most famous libraries in England.  Former imperial powers would probably understand better than most what they have done in war.  I hope that, in signing up to this instrument, as they have, they understand the consequences of the wars they wage.<br\/><br\/>Occurrences such as the blanket bombing in Yemen, for example, can have consequences if there are heritage sites in the affected areas.  We have seen what is happening in Iraq and Syria.  We saw what happened in Afghanistan, where various groups set out specifically to target the historical artefacts to try to change the outlook of the world.  The same was also true when the crusaders roamed Europe and the Middle East.  There is much that is still contained in libraries here that should be considered in this regard.<\/p><p>We should remind the English in particular that they pillaged not only Ireland but also other countries during different wars.  There are materials in British museums which were taken as loot or the spoils of war during 1916 and afterwards and which should be returned to Ireland, and not on loan.  We got the Fianna flag back last year.  The British ambassador was very accommodating in getting the English Queen to allow us to have that flag, which was confiscated by the British, back on loan for a few months.  That has now been extended to a lifetime loan.  It should be granted back to us in perpetuity, but a loan is better than nothing.  It is part of our heritage.  The same goes for Roger Casement's trunk.  It was taken when his house was raided.  It had nothing to do with his trial for treason, but it has never been returned to his family.  It is on display in the British Imperial War Museum.  It never belonged to them and should be returned.  There are other museums in this country which have materials from other periods and wars.  Those institutions should consider what do with the materials in question.<\/p> <p> I support the Bill&rsquo;s intent and, hopefully, it will have the desired effect.  It can only have that effect if countries partaking in a war are willing to abide by it, however.  That is one of the biggest problems with many of these international covenants.  In the case of the destruction of cultural properties, the biggest transgressors do not care less what convention is in place.  How do we impress upon them the need to protect the history of the world?  Those are the major cultural properties that need to be protected under this legislation.  If a transgressor specifically targets the archaeological or built heritage of a country, what are the sanctions?  Who will make the complaint against the transgressors and who will impose sanctions in the middle of or are after a war?  Sometimes, it is too late and the damage is done.  Hopefully, there should not be a need to have to be recourse to this legislation but I am also enough of a realist to accept that there could be.<\/p> <p> I remind Members that in war the priority must be to protect civilians and get them out of harm's way.  Often, the protection of cultural property comes second to this.  That is a pity, but the priority we set is that life is more sacred than property.  The world is worse off when things are lost as a result of such events.  Thankfully, in the modern age we have, at the very least, photographs, films, records of the dimensions of buildings, etc.  Some 200 years ago, when destruction was wrought upon the built heritage of a country, there might have been nothing left after a week or two.  As there were no photographs, buildings, etc., were destroyed and gone for ever more.<\/p> <p> I wish the Bill well and support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000032#HH01900","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490882100,"counter":256,"content":"<p>This debate on the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (Hague Convention) Bill 2016 is important in and of itself.  It also raises several issues about our role in conflict, however.  While I support the Bill, I will consider tabling amendments to it on Committee Stage.  I am also concerned about the motivation behind this Bill and why the Government is introducing it now.  There is no question about how good it is that we should sign up to a convention where we commit to protecting humanity&rsquo;s cultural and artistic heritage from destruction in war.  However, when the Minister set out the case for supporting this legislation, not surprisingly, he referred to Palmyra and recent events in Syria.  Of course, those events should be mentioned.  Any discussion of the destruction of cultural artefacts and heritage in conflict could not but include mention of the appalling scenes we saw of Daesh deliberately destroying an absolutely irreplaceable part of humanity's cultural heritage in Syria.  We witnessed the remains of one of the great ancient civilisations being systematically destroyed.<\/p>  <p>  What is incredible is that the Minister only referred to what happened to the Arch of Triumph in Palmyra.  That is a pretty extraordinary one-sidedness when we are debating the rationale behind signing up to a convention about the protection of cultural property.  Why would the Minister not talk about the destruction of the National Museum of Iraq and the damage done to ancient site of Babylon during the US-led war in Iraq?  According to those people and organisations charged with the protection of humanity's cultural heritage, the worst act, bar one, of cultural destruction and vandalism was the destruction of the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad and the damage done to the ancient site of Babylon, one of the most ancient locations of early human civilisation, during the US-led war in Iraq.  At these sites, there were three different fires.  Ancient documents were looted and burned.  Contamination and destruction were visited up on the ancient heritage site of Babylon.  The latter was done explicitly by the US forces which, incredibly, used that site as their military headquarters during 2003.  All of this happened, despite warnings from universities and organisations - in the US itself and other countries -  representatives from which with Pentagon officials on several occasions before the war was launched.  These individuals pleaded with the American authorities to do nothing that would lead to the destruction of that heritage site and the museum and cause irreversible damage to our human heritage.<\/p><p>The Pentagon ignored them and did absolutely nothing to protect the Baghdad museum, even though they were pre-warned.  It is not as if this just happened and they were not warned in advance.  They were warned again and again that this was going to happen if they went ahead with their planned invasion and bombing without taking some measures - setting aside the debate about the war itself - in terms of having specific measures to protect that heritage but they ignored those warnings.  Donald Rumsfeld who was questioned about this at the time after the first looting began, completely dismissed it.  They maintained the military base on the Babylon site and then handed it over to the Polish forces afterwards.  They used the soil and sand there, which was packed with archaeological artefacts, for sandbags for the US soldiers, which they set up around the site.  They brought in diggers and tractors, dug up the ground, contaminated the site and removed soil containing artefacts which will never be recovered.  The Baghdad national museum was completely looted.  <\/p> <p> I will tell the Leas-Cheann Comhairle something even worse about all this.  At the time all the serious and respectable cultural institutions and universities met collectors, museum directors and so on who were lobbying the Pentagon prior to the war.  If the Minister remembers back to 2003, as anti-war activists our biggest concern was about the human destruction that was going to be visited on the population of Iraq but we also warned, as did many, about the cultural destruction that would take place in one of the most ancient civilisations in the world bar none.  At the time another small group called The American Council for Cultural Property was founded in late 2002.  That group, which had very close contacts with the Bush Administration, started lobbying the Administration for a different approach to the cultural property that might fall into US hands when the war started and it said that as soon as they got into Iraq, they should relax the laws on the collection, export, sale and the putting into the market of artefacts, documents, heritages pieces and that might fall into US military hands.  When the Baghdad museum was looted - although some of looting was done by common thieves and some of it involved Iraqi people who were trying to protect their heritage and took artefacts away until after the conflict - the reports were clear subsequently that much of what went on involved people who were organised and who knew exactly what they were looking for and that such artefacts found their way into the market and were sold for profit.  This had been well organised in advance by outside forces.  We can put those two things together, namely, the failure of the Bush Administration, despite warnings, and the military forces under its auspices to protect these artefacts and then an organised theft of much of those artefacts taking place.  Nobody stopped them and this was at the time that the world was screaming about what was happening.  When the first looting started Rumsfeld and his gang said there was nothing to see there.  It was only weeks later that they eventually put in some tokenistic protections when the horse had already bolted, the destruction and fires had happened and all the looting had taken place.  I will tell the Minister what I believe.  I believe our friends, The American Council for Cultural Property, founded months before the invasion in late 2002 and with close contacts with the Bush Administration, had a well-organised plan, which was facilitated - or at least a blind eye was turned deliberately - by the US forces.  Is that not what they went on to do to the rest of the country - to its resources and its oil?  They went in to loot the country and, of course, most importantly, kill 1 million people while they were doing it.  I find it amazing that the Minister did not mention this.<\/p> <p> I would also mention in passing what Israel has done in Gaza.  Does the Minister know how many mosques were destroyed by Israel in Gaza during its recent assaults?  A total of 203 mosques were attacked during Operation Protective Edge, 73 were completely destroyed and two churches were also extremely badly damaged.  These include, for example, the Al-Omari Mosque in Jabaliya, Gaza's oldest and largest mosque built in the seventh century and named after the second caliph, Umar bin Al-Khattab.  It dates back to 649 AD, making it 1,365 years old and it was totally destroyed by Israel.  The time available does not permit me to go through the rest of them on the list but systematic deliberate destruction of ancient Palestinian heritage, and also human heritage, part of the ancient civilisations of this area, took place.    <\/p> <p> I wonder why the Minister does not mentioned these matters.  They are recent events.  Why do we not talk about that?  Why do we talk only about Palmyra and the crimes of ISIS, which, of course, must be mentioned and roundly condemned?  I suspect, like everything else, that we are completely one-sided in our apparent concern about these matters.  When one side that is deemed to be the enemy, the adversary or the problem engages in such destruction, we will condemn it but when our allies do it, we keep shtum, even when they are signatories of this convention.  The US signed the first protocol.  Israel is probably not a signatory, I am not sure about that - the Minister can probably confirm that - but the United States certainly is a signatory.  Why does the Minister not mention those matters?  I suspect it is because there are two different standards, particularly when it is applies to the United States.<\/p> <p> This brings me on to another point I want to make.

In this regard, we will have to consider whether the review of the culture and ethos of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be undertaken as a discrete piece of work, as originally intended or whether it should be part of any wider review.  My view is that it should be part of the wider review.  The culture and ethos of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are very much part and parcel of the whole and should be dealt with as such.  The Garda Inspectorate's report, Changing Policing in Ireland, devotes a chapter to the culture of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Garda Commissioner came before the Committee on Justice and Equality this morning and she and her colleagues gave a number of pieces of information to the committee.  I am concerned, however, about the information given about the southern audit, the national audit and the general publication of information about the breath test data last week.  I am concerned that there may have been an intention on the part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that this information would not enter the public domain.  In fact, it only entered the public domain as a result of an article published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>on 20 February 2017, which prompted Garda activity.  I do not know whether the T&aacute;naiste has anything to say in respect of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000036#MM00500","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1490883300,"counter":269,"content":"<p>The Deputy and other members of the justice committee had the opportunity this morning for a very detailed discussion with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which I watched.

I think she also addressed a point, which I think the Deputy is also raising, about timely information being given to all the bodies she named.  There are four or five involved.  This is about timely, transparent information.  The role of the Policing Authority will be critical in this regard because there were some discussions in that body about these issues.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda, in the meantime, is getting on with the audit, which is not yet completed in respect of one of the issues.  As I told the House, I had expected it in June, in the second quarter of this year, and the information was put out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as it explained this morning.  I think the Garda wanted the information to be in the public arena but I also think in retrospect - of course, things are always clearer in retrospect - there was a place for the information to be shared more fully all along the way.  That is a lesson the Commissioner has learned, as she said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000036#MM00600","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1490883300,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I wish to indicate to the T&aacute;naiste the basis for my concern about the timelines.  In the statement on the timelines provided by senior management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they outlined that it was on 24 February 2017 that a sample of data was received from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  I asked the witnesses before the Committee on Justice and Equality today when they sought this information from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety and was informed that they did so days in advance of 24 February 2017.  In light of the fact the Garda did not seek information from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety for the southern audit and had not sought it for the national audit until that stage, even though the Garda was able to change its IT system on foot of the indications from that national audit, I am concerned that the contact with the Medical Bureau of Road Safety in February 2017 was prompted by an article in a newspaper.  Taking into account that the Policing Authority was not told about this and, as I believe, the T&aacute;naiste was not told about it, there may be some legitimacy to my concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000036#MM00700","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1490883300,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I will take up the point about the role of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety because it is a very important one.  I met Professor Cusack earlier this week, I think, at the transport meeting and had a detailed discussion with him about the data the bureau has.  It seems to me that there needs to be far greater co-operation - \"contact\" is probably the right word - and exchange of information between the two bodies.  I think the new machines now being introduced with global positioning system, GPS, functionality and greater detail and the other new systems that have been put in place will make a difference.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt that the Deputy will pursue the matter of the delay further and that more information will become available, but my understanding as to the reason for the delay is that the Garda was gathering a vast amount of written, paper-based material from 108 districts, which was very difficult to gather.  This is what Assistant Commissioner Finn told me last Monday, and it was repeated this morning.  It was when the Garda had finally gathered this material that it was then in a position to compare it with that of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  I take the Deputy's point that if the Garda had had access to the database earlier or had started the comparisons earlier, perhaps this would have given a more comprehensive picture.  He is probably right about that, but my assumption at this point, based on the information I have, is that the Garda was waiting to gather as much material as it could from the paper-based trail in respect of which it was operating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000036#MM00800","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Policing Issues","time":1490883300,"counter":272,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000036#MM00900"},{"type":"question","time":1490883300,"counter":273,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[15900\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000036#MM01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when she was first informed of the serious discrepancies in the way in which the Garda recorded roadside alcohol tests and the reasons 14,700 persons convicted in the courts were prosecuted without fixed-charge notices first being issued; her plans to address these very serious matters; and if her attention has been drawn to any additional issues by the Garda Commissioner that have yet to be made public which may bring the Garda into further disrepute.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1490883300,"counter":274,"content":"<p>When was the T&aacute;naiste first informed of the serious discrepancies in the way in which the Garda recorded roadside alcohol tests and the reasons 14,700 persons convicted in the courts were prosecuted without fixed-charge notices first being issued?

The Road Safety Authority, RSA, forwarded the correspondence to the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, who wrote to the Garda Commissioner in April 2014.  He copied that correspondence and the letter to the Commissioner to the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter, on 11 April 2014.  Mr. Shatter immediately took the matter up and wrote to the Garda Commissioner on 16 April seeking a full report on the findings of an examination of the allegations.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated in a detailed response to my Department in May 2014, which I spoke about last night, that it had looked into the claims regarding MAT checkpoints in the western region and that it was satisfied that correct procedures were in place to account for MAT checkpoints that ultimately went ahead and those which did not proceed.  The report indicated that further inquiries were to be conducted, and accordingly the Garda Commissioner was asked by my Department in August 2014 for an update.  A further report on 8 January 2015 indicated that it was not possible to identify the author, but that was not really the point.<\/p><p>They had further consultation and liaison with the western region and the reserves around the country.  I think the Garda Commissioner went into detail on that. <br\/><br\/>Following a submission of these reports to me on 21 January 2015, a letter issued at my request to the Garda Commissioner asking that the Commissioner consider whether there was scope for issuing any further instructions from Garda management regarding day to day operations in relation to MAT within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br\/><br\/>I received a reply to that letter on 2 March 2015 which indicated that the assistant commissioner with responsibility for traffic had been directed to issue an instruction regarding monitoring the mechanisms in place surrounding the operation of MAT checkpoints, as opposed to the alcohol tests.  On 10 June 2016, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na notified the Department that, following an audit of the southern region from 2009-2014, discrepancies had been identified in the breath test data held by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the PULSE system and, consequently, in the data published on the Garda website.  That same month, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na directed that a national audit should take place of all the data recorded on the Garda PULSE system relating to the number of roadside breath tests conducted at MATs in each Garda division.  This audit covered the period 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2016.  Public information was given on this and a notice was published on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's website in June 2016.  In February this year, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated to my Department that the full results of the breath test statistics audit would be available by the end of the second quarter of 2017.  As the Deputy knows, we then had the press conference that gave the figure, which was when I heard for the first time about the serious discrepancies there.  <br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>In so far as the issues relating to fixed charge notices, FCNs, are concerned, the Department was first made aware of several errors relating to the fixed charge processing system, FCPS, on 10 June 2016.  In a press statement issued on the same date, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na confirmed that it had commenced a review of prosecutions in respect of all fixed charge offences.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na subsequently provided a further update to the Department on 14 March 2017 of its review of the errors surrounding fixed charge notices.  The letter indicated that the review of all summonses issued in respect of fixed charge notices for the period of 1 January 2014 to 27 May 2016 had been completed and that, following consultation with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, a review of all such summonses dating back to the introduction of fixed charge notices in 2006 was under way.<br\/><br\/>As the Deputy is aware, the full statistics in regard to the FCN review for the period dating back to 2006 were presented by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at its press conference on 23 March 2017.  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also presented at that press conference, for the first time, the figures on the huge disparity between the number of breath tests conducted at MAT checkpoints as per PULSE records, compared with the number of test kits used. <br\/><br\/>The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has confirmed that it has put solutions in place to deal with the procedural and practice issues that have been detected to ensure that such errors do not recur.  Specifically, I have been assured by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a permanent and comprehensive information technology, IT, solution is now in place to cover the majority of FCPS issues identified and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is satisfied that the errors that occurred cannot be repeated.  In the case of breath tests or mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initially put in place new paper-based recording and verification processes and, in November 2016, a new specific data recording IT upgrade was installed on the Garda PULSE system.  The net effect of the new IT upgrade was that personnel now have to record the serial number of the device used for each breath test plus the meter reading before and after the checkpoint was concluded.  Data from the device is now used to verify the total number of breath tests conducted at each checkpoint.<br\/><br\/>In so far as the 14,700 people convicted of road traffic offences in court following the incorrect issuing of a summons are concerned, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established a dedicated support helpline for members of the public with queries in relation to their cases.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also writing to all affected members of the public, explaining what has happened and outlining the solution to rectify the situation.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has indicated that it has been advised by the Director of Public Prosecutions and Courts Service that these 14,700 cases must be brought back before the courts at Circuit Court level with a view to requesting that the erroneous convictions be set aside.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established a dedicated team to this end and is liaising with the Court Service to expedite this process.  Members of the public affected by the road traffic enforcement errors referred to are requested to await the aforementioned correspondence from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which will provide further clarification on the matter.  I have raised these issues with the Garda Commissioner and the chairperson of the Policing Authority and have outlined my very serious concerns. <br\/><br\/>The Deputy will be aware that in addition to outlining the issues, how they had come to light, and the remedial steps taken so far, at her press conference on 27 March 2017, the Commissioner announced the restructuring of traffic policing with the creation of a new roads policing unit to be led by Assistant Commissioner Mick Finn; announced the creation of a dedicated team under newly-appointed Assistant Commissioner Michael O'Sullivan to investigate in detail the MATs issue, including with a view to identifying and holding responsible for their actions any Garda members, whether at junior, supervisory or management level, who acted improperly; and committed to forwarding the report of this investigation to the Policing Authority and Department of Justice and Equality when completed.  <br\/><br\/>Assistant Commissioner Finn outlined new arrangements agreed this week with the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS, to the effect that body would supply An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with its data on breath testing devices on a quarterly basis, in order to ensure an independent benchmark against which Garda data can be measured.  The MBRS will shortly be tendering for new breath testing equipment.  New equipment, which is available in the marketplace has the capacity to record the time, GPS location and number of persons breath tested, and has the capacity to download the information automatically, reducing the chances of errors occurring in the data.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding any internal review, the Government believes that an external investigation into these two specific matters needs be carried out.  The Government believes the level of public concern is so profound that it may now be time to conduct a thorough, comprehensive and independent root and branch review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is clearly a proposal that will require further detailed consideration by the Government.  The Government also believes that any such proposal should command widespread support in the Oireachtas and accordingly be the subject of consultation with the Opposition, and ultimately approval by the Oireachtas.<br\/><br\/>The Garda Commissioner had already referred the breath test and FCN matters to the Policing Authority.  The chairperson of the Policing Authority, Josephine Feehily, has confirmed that the authority will continue to examine these matters.  The reason I prioritised and set up the authority was to shine a light on, and examine, issues such as these.  Ms Feehily indicated that the Policing Authority would have an independent professional audit undertaken of the steps taken to resolve the issues; oversee the ongoing cultural audit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is already being put in place and oversee the investigation being undertaken by Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan.  Ms Feehily also confirmed, as already announced, that the focus of its public meeting with the Garda Commissioner to be held on 27 April will be roads policing.<br\/><br\/>I share the many concerns voiced in recent days about the extent of the road traffic enforcement issues highlighted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the numbers involved.  The Garda Commissioner has given me her personal undertaking that all necessary steps will be taken to ensure that these errors cannot reoccur.  I have emphasised to the Garda Commissioner that the practices that allowed breath test misreporting and FCN errors to happen within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over many years need to be fully addressed and the new systems that she has put in place will need to be robust, tested and verified in the time ahead. <br\/><br\/>I am not aware of any further concerns relating to Garda practices and procedures, but I will continue to maintain close contact with the Garda Commissioner in relation to any and all issues requiring my attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000036#MM01200","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490883900,"counter":277,"content":"<p>This area was comprehensively dealt with here for two hours although I am not sure if we got all the answers.

I am the first Minister to put together a committee with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality to make sure we give it the money to try to get the systems up to date.

The prospect that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would not be available to protect the public was regarded as a very dangerous step.  That it was such a shock to the public was indicative of the reliance that the public have upon An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

This should also lead to better outcomes regarding road traffic enforcement.<\/p><p>The modernisation and renewal programme, which is being overseen by the Policing Authority, contains key strategic objectives for road policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's road policing plans over the next five years.  The overall point I would make is that it is critical that we continue recruitment because it is through continuing recruitment involving more people being recruited rather than retiring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be in a position to allocate more garda&iacute; for community policing and road traffic policing and across the system.  This is what we need to see.  People will welcome that because we need visible, efficient and responsive policing throughout the country to strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  The Deputy knows that the workforce plan to bring the numbers to 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members and 2,000 reserve members is in place.  The Deputy will have seen the recruitment advertisements that appeared last week.  Many Members of this House will welcome that new recruitment.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide-ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserve personnel.  It will take some time given that there was no recruitment for five years because of the economic situation.  Thankfully, that is being reversed and we can invest again.  This will help in this area.  This is combined with all the issues we were talking about this week that need change and more rigorous enforcement.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>It will take some time before there are fully trained officers available to replace adequately personnel who have retired across the entire organisation, including the traffic corps.  However, the Commissioner has confirmed that the personnel requirement of the Garda traffic corps is being assessed to identify the most vulnerable areas in regard to serious traffic collisions and the level of compliance with road traffic legislation.  I understand that the assistant commissioner with responsibility for roads policing is currently assessing the capacity of divisions and districts to identify and target areas where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could accelerate the deployment of personnel to traffic in 2017.  The filling of any vacancies identified will be conducted on a structured basis and will be further enhanced with the recently renewed recruitment campaigns to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Garda Commissioner has in recent days announced the restructuring of traffic policing with the creation of a new roads policing unit to be led by Assistant Commissioner Michael Finn.<\/p><p>Ireland has over a number of years developed a multi-agency approach to road safety through the involvement of a number of agencies working in partnership under the aegis of the road safety strategy.  Under this year's policing plan, new measures will be explored with partner agencies relating to driver compliance and the promotion of a safe and crime-free road network.  The plan also points to the enhancement of the use of technology to continue to deprive criminals of the use of the road network and develop policing capabilities.  Among the road traffic initiatives identified in the plan are the strengthening and redevelopment of the traffic corps to tackle all forms of criminality on our road network, ongoing planning, risk assessment and operational preparation for major emergencies in conjunction with emergency management partners.<\/p><p>Road traffic legislation is, of course, also enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and, ultimately, reducing death and injuries on our roads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000040#QQ00500","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1490885700,"counter":315,"content":"<p>This is good news.

Since becoming Minister for Justice and Equality, the issue of statistics has been at the core of my concern about the ICT requirements in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not just nationally but internationally.  I have had many meetings on this.  I have tried to ensure data can be exchanged not just nationally but internationally.  This is why I relentlessly pursued the investment of more than &euro;200 million for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because, of course, I was concerned.  I was concerned enough to arrange a meeting with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, when questions were raised about the quality of statistics.  The CSO publishes crime statistics and has taken a series of steps to ensure they are ever more reliable because we must arrive at a point where they can be relied upon.  That work has been under way and the CSO has noted progress in this regard, but there is more work to be done.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the question of whether the Garda traffic corps should be autonomous, I would like to speak in response to Deputy Lahart about other actions that are being undertaken in respect of traffic.

Deputy Broughan's question is very interesting and is one that a review could look at among other issues because the Deputy is really raising the issue of management, how various tasks are done and what form of management provides the best results.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Lahart's question, the assistant commissioner with responsibility for roads policing is assessing the capacity of divisions and districts to identify and target areas where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could accelerate the deployment of personnel to traffic in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000040#QQ00800","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1490885700,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Can I come back?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000040#QQ00900","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1490885700,"counter":319,"content":"<p>The Deputy can but, normally, there are only two supplementaries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000040#QQ01000","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1490885700,"counter":320,"content":"<p>That is very good of the Ceann Comhairle.

In 2014 the personnel strength for the Wicklow division was 274, in 2015 it was 282, in 2016 it was 277 and in 2017 it was 275.  In 2015 there were nine newly attested garda&iacute; given to the Wicklow area, which is the total given to that area.<\/p><p>As I explained to the House earlier, the Government is committed to ensuring a stronger and more visible police presence.  We have said in A Programme for Partnership Government commitments that we will increase the numbers of garda&iacute;.  There will be a workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, which will comprise 15,000 garda&iacute;, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  The funding has been made available for 2017 and we have a plan, and Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan is aware of this plan, for each of the years in order to reach those numbers.<\/p><p>The target is well on course to be achieved and the Government is committed to funding it.  This year, which is an important year, there will be 800 Garda recruits going into Templemore.  This means that more garda&iacute; will be able to be allocated, not just to the Deputy&rsquo;s area of County Wicklow, but also throughout the state as we will have more recruits coming through.<\/p><p>Obviously, during the five years when the Templemore training college was closed it was an extremely difficult period for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, when it was not possible for new people to be allocated or for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be transferred - there were many transfer requests in also.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.<\/p><p>This plan is well on course to be achieved.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p><p>I am advised that, since the reopening of the Garda college in September 2014, there has been a total intake of some 1,400 new recruits with another 600 scheduled to enter the college by the end of this year.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that some 839 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, nine of whom have been assigned to the Wicklow division.  I am also informed that another 750 trainee garda&iacute; are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to approximately 13,500 by year end - a net increase of 700 in total Garda strength since recruitment recommenced.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Garda Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of garda&iacute; across every Garda division, including the Wicklow division in the coming years.<\/p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in applied policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Garda Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<\/p><p>For ease of reference I have provided, for the record, a breakdown of the detailed information requested in respect of the number of newly attested garda&iacute; allocated to the Wicklow division, since the first attestation of trainee garda&iacute; in April 2015 and the number of garda&iacute; assigned to the Wicklow division on 30 September 2014 and 28 February 2017,  the latest date for which figures are readily available. <\/p><p><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th><b>Personnel Strength<\/b><\/th><th><b>Number of newly attested Garda<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>2014<\/b><\/td><td>274<\/td><td>n\/a<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2015<\/b><\/td><td>282<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2016<\/b><\/td><td>277<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2017<\/b><\/td><td>275<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017033000041#RR00600","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1490886300,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for her answer.
