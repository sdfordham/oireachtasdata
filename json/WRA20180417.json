I\u00a0have not heard\u00a0a\u00a0viable alternative put forward as to how a person, who has unestablished needs and turns up here unexpectedly, can be immediately provided with\u00a0shelter and an acceptable level of care. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the absence of an alternative, any commitment to abolish a system that offers instant shelter and support would pose a serious risk to the wellbeing of protection applicants and undermine our international obligations.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the system has already been subject to a complete review in 2014.\u00a0 Mr. Justice\u00a0Bryan McMahon chaired a Working Group comprised of advocates and officials and made 173 recommendations for reform of the protection process including direct provision. The report was accepted by Government and three separate itemised progress reports on these recommendations were published on\u00a0my Department&rsquo;s website, resulting in change being achieved across 98% of the recommendations.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Very significant changes and improvements have been made to our Direct Provision Centres over the last two years.\u00a0 For example,\u00a0substantial reforms to the living conditions of applicants. Five centres now provide independent living (food hall distribution and cooking) facilities to a total of 1,430 residents and\u00a0it is planned that an additional 900\u00a0residents\u00a0will have access to these facilities\u00a0before\u00a0the end of\u00a0this year.\u00a0 Indeed by early next year over half of residents will have access to independent living within the next year.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Of course, individual problems and issues can and do arise when any individual interacts with a service provided by the state but, in such circumstances, where complaints are made and applicants are not happy with how matters are resolved, International Protection Applicants now have full access to the services of the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the improvements made arising from the recommendations\u00a0in the\u00a0McMahon Report, the Government has looked to further consolidate those improvements and build upon them.\u00a0 In particular, the decision to opt into the (recast) Reception Conditions Directive represents\u00a0another major reform of the process.\u00a0 The requirements now being formally placed on our system of Direct Provision to comply formally with EU norms is another welcome advancement, which will be concluded by June of this year.\u00a0 The opt-in to the EU&rsquo;s Recast Reception Directive will further improve our processes, subject them to external oversight and place our services on a common European standard. The opt-in process is continuing and this will\u00a0allow the European Commission to conduct its assessment of the management and conditions pertaining to our Direct Provision system and present their findings in\u00a0the future.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to the ongoing reform in relation to Direct Provision or any other aspect of our asylum system that may be required in order that we have a system in Ireland that reaches or exceeds the standards required by the Reception Conditions Directive and that will compare favourably with the best systems of our EU partners. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700059#WRA02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":31,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700059#WRA03000"},{"type":"question","counter":32,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[16571\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700059#WRA03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of new Garda recruits assigned to each Garda station in County Louth in each of the years 2014 to 2017 and to date in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1332","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":33,"content":"<p>I should say at the outset that the distribution of Garda personnel,\u00a0including the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;, is exclusively the statutory responsibility of the Garda Commissioner. <\/p><p>Notwithstanding the Commissioner's responsibility, I have provided for the record, in tabular form, the detailed information requested by the Deputy.\u00a0 <\/p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as of the 28 February 2018, the latest date for which figures are available,\u00a0the strength of the\u00a0Louth Division was 311.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed\u00a0Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p><p>I can assure the House that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members. <\/p><p>Real, tangible progress has been made towards this goal. Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>The closure of the Garda College by the Government of the day\u00a0in 2010 and the moratorium imposed at that time had a negative impact on Garda numbers across all Divisions and we continue to be negatively impacted by the legacy of the recession. Since\u00a0when my Party took office in 2011 following the severe economic crash, we, along with our partners in Government, set about existing the bailout, stabilising the economy and returning to growth and job creation. We\u00a0reopened the College in September 2014 and since then\u00a0just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are performing mainstream duties nationwide. <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 200 of whom attested last month.\u00a0Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;. Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda Division, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream. <\/p><p>I have set out in the attached spreadsheet the number of new Garda Recruits allocated to each station in the Roscommon\/Longford, West Cork, Sligo\/Leitrim, Donegal, Meath, Kildare, Cavan\/Monaghan and Wexford\u00a0Garda Divisions, in each of the years 2014 and to date in 2018 as supplied by the Commissioner.<\/p><p><b>Probationer Garda Allocations 2015 &ndash;

Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including 76 to the Laois\/Offaly Division. <\/p>  <p>  Community policing, as the Deputy is well aware, is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and every Garda has a role to play in community policing.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of progress on this important initiative, I am informed by the Commissioner that a draft Community Policing Framework which outlines the manner in which Community Policing Teams and Community Safety Fora will be established has been completed and is subject to internal review before being approved by the Executive for implementation.

Some &euro;46million was allocated for investment in the Garda fleet to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit for purpose fleet. This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the fleet in the period 2013 to 2015.

It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013. The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways:<\/p>  <p>  - firstly, some serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and <\/p>  <p>  - secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointments Service (PAS)\u00a0have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years. <\/p>  <p>  The \"Programme for a Partnership Government\" includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures. In line with this, the Government has in place a plan to achieve a Reserve strength of 2,000 by 2021. <\/p>  <p>  With the plan to reach 15,000 Garda members well on track, it was possible for the Commissioner and the\u00a0PAS to undertake a new recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves\u00a0last March. That competition\u00a0attracted 2,394 applicants of whom 498 successfully completed the initial stages carried out by PAS. These applications are currently being processed by the Garda Appointments Office. The time frame for this can vary due to a number factors, including the length of the vetting process which may, for example, be more time consuming if the applicant has resided abroad or is deferred for medical reasons. It is expected that the first of the successful candidates will commence training in the Garda College in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  In conjunction with the major expansion of the Reserve over the next number of years, we must ensure that it is used to optimum effect to support effective policing.

This is intended to ensure that its development and deployment is viewed more broadly through a community policing lens.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have faced down this type of threat in the past and will do so again. As such, I do not believe that additional emergency legislation is required at this time. <\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that a number of legislative measures have been introduced to tackle gang-related and associated crime.

These changes have made the bail system far stronger and have made the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail. The court has the power to refuse bail where there are reasonable grounds to believe the person is likely to commit a serious offence. In assessing this likelihood, the court must take into account the nature and seriousness of the offence, the accused person&rsquo;s previous offending and may also take into account the danger he or she poses to the public if bail is granted. The Criminal Justice Act 2017 also strengthened Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail providing a power of arrest without warrant, and made provisions to increase the use of curfews and to facilitate the introduction of electronic tagging for those on bail in certain circumstances.    <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions.

Having taken a wide range of issues into consideration, as set out in the Review report, the Secretary General recommended:<\/p><p>- that the SCU should be wound down;<\/p><p>- that the Department should revert to a reformed Government Information Service (GIS) model, with a smaller budget, less staff and a more limited role than the SCU; and that measures should be put in place across Government Departments which preserve the valuable and necessary reforms to ensure value for money, professionalisation and modernisation in government communications activity.<\/p><p>There will be a transition period until July 2018 for the implementation of all of the recommended next steps as set out in the Review.<\/p><p>At time of publication of the Review, there were fifteen staff assigned to the SCU comprising one Director (Assistant Secretary level); one Principal Officer; four Assistant Principal Officers; one Higher Executive Officer equivalent (Acting); one Higher Executive Officer; three Administrative Officers; three Communications &amp;amp; Media Assistants (Executive Officer equivalent); and one Executive Officer.<\/p><p>The reassignment of staff is being dealt with as a confidential HR matter by the management of my Department in consultation with each individual staff member.  <\/p><p>As outlined in the Review, surplus staff will be given the opportunity to be reassigned to another post either within my Department or in other Departments or agencies.  In some cases, the duties of staff will not change as they either predated the establishment of the SCU or their work will continue in a reformed GIS.  There will be no redundancies arising from the implementation of the recommendations of the Review.  <\/p><p>Following the publication of the Review, I informed the House (and the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Taoiseach) that the 2018 funding allocation for the Unit would be reduced by &euro;2.5 million.  Indeed, my Department has subsequently been liaising with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to give effect to this &euro;2.5 million reduction in my Department's 2018 Revised Estimate.

Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition on the e-tenders website and on the Official Journal of the European Union, where appropriate, in line with the European Union procurement Directives, including the Directive 2009\/81\/EC on the award of contracts in the fields of defence and security. Details of tender competitions can be accessed on the Government's e-tenders website www.etenders.ie. In addition, the Department routinely publishes details of purchase orders for goods and services valued over &euro;20,000 on its website www.defence.ie which provides details of supplies.<\/p>  <p>  The most significant investment of recent years by the Defence Organisation has been on the procurement of the new Off-Shore Patrol Vessels for the Naval Service. This programme has seen the delivery of three new Naval Service vessels since 2014. The L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett was commissioned in May 2014, L&Eacute; James Joyce was commissioned in September 2015 and L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats was commissioned into service in October 2016.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2016, a contract for an additional sister ship was agreed, bringing investment in the new ships programme to some &euro;250 million since 2010. The fourth ship, to be named L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw is scheduled for delivery later this year. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to major equipment projects for the Army a maintenance and upgrade programme has commenced for the current fleet of 80 Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) which will seek to ensure viability of the fleet out to 2030. The Mowag APC is a key operational vehicle for overseas service. \u00a0A contract was agreed in December 2016 with General Dynamics European Land Systems &ndash; Mowag, the original manufacturer of the fleet based in Switzerland, for a maintenance and upgrade programme. The value of the contract is &euro;55m exclusive of VAT. The programme of work\u00a0is being\u00a0carried out on a phased basis over 5-6 years to ensure the availability of vehicles for operational service during that period.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a contract for the supply of a small number of armoured logistical vehicles has been awarded to Westward Scania Ireland, due for delivery in 2018\u00a0and a number of armoured utility vehicles (24) have recently been procured from Centigon, France.\u00a0 These armoured vehicles, acquired at a combined cost of approx. &euro;11m, will complement the force protection fleet for operational service overseas. Both contracts were awarded on foot of public tender competitions.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Air Corps, the White Paper sets out that the Cessna fleet will be replaced with three larger aircraft suitable equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks. In December 2017, following an open tender competition advertised on the eTenders website and on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) in accordance with national and EU procurement regulations, a contract was placed with Pilatus Aircraft Ltd at a cost of some &euro;32m for the provision of three PC-12\u00a0fixed wing utility aircraft suitable equipped for ISTAR tasks which will replace the Cessna fleet.<\/p>  <p>  Also, a decision was made in 2016 to replace a PC-9M aircraft and this aircraft was delivered from Pilatus Aircraft in Switzerland in July 2017 at a cost of &euro;5m exclusive of VAT. The new aircraft brings the fleet up to 8 and will assist in a required increase in pilot training in the Air Corps.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The acquisition of new equipment and equipment upgrades for the Defence Forces remains a clear focus for me, and the White Paper on Defence recognises that there are several new and or enhanced platforms to be procured. Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning process. <\/p>  <p>  The National Development Plan provides for a Capital allocation of &euro;541m for Defence for the five year period 2018-2022. This allocation will facilitate the investment necessary to ensure that the Defence Forces have the equipment and infrastructure to deliver on all their roles as set out in the White Paper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700062#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme Review","counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700062#WRD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":297,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[15967\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700062#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if the submission made by his Department to the capital review undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which seeks a substantial increase in capital investment, as referred to on page 22 in the ministerial brief published in June 2017, will be provided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":298,"content":"<p>In 2017, as part of the Mid-Term Review of the Capital Plan, &lsquo;Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016 &ndash; 2021&rsquo;, submissions were made by Departments, including Defence, \u00a0to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER).<\/p><p>These submissions, including my Department&rsquo;s, are available publicly on the DPER website at www.per.gov.ie. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700062#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Properties","counter":299,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700062#WRD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":300,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[15968\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700062#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the detail of the sale of all lands owned by the Defence Forces in each of the past five years; the location of the lands; the amount received; the date the sale occurred; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":301,"content":"<p>Since 1998 my Department has been engaged on an ongoing programme of barracks consolidation and the property portfolio is under continual review.

It is the Government&rsquo;s intent that this new vessel will provide a flexible and adaptive capability for a wide range of maritime tasks, both at home and overseas. Planning has commenced on this project and it is intended to hold a public tender competition in due course to cover the supply of the MRV.\u00a0 This procurement is, of course, subject to the availability of funding within the overall Defence capital funding envelope.

The original intention was to sell L&Eacute; Aoife by way of public auction in the same manner. However, following a formal expression of interest from the Maltese authorities in acquiring L&Eacute; Aoife, and subsequent discussions between the then Minister for Defence and the Maltese Minister for Home Affairs and National Security, the plan to sell L&Eacute; Aoife was reconsidered. The Maltese authorities requested the ship for their armed forces to patrol the Mediterranean Sea to endeavour to deal with the on-going difficult refugee crisis in the region. The then Minister agreed to the transfer of ownership of L&Eacute; Aoife to the Maltese Armed Forces on humanitarian grounds. While the vessel was no longer viable for use in Irish waters, it was ideally suited to address a pressing short-term requirement for the Maltese authorities.\u00a0\u00a0Last year the L&Eacute; Aisling was sold by way of public auction for &euro;110,000.<\/p>  <p>  The investment in\u00a0modern new vessels\u00a0 will ensure that the operational capabilities of the Naval Service are maintained to the greatest extent.\u00a0I am satisfied that the current provisions, together with the courses of action in the White Paper, will continue to ensure that the Naval Service, as the State's principal seagoing agency,\u00a0is suitably equipped to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700062#WRD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Corps Operations","counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700062#WRD03100"},{"type":"question","counter":319,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[15976\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700062#WRD03200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the emergency aeronautical support operations undertaken in 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":320,"content":"<p>The Air Corps provides a broad range of services in accordance with its primary security role.\u00a0\u00a0The Air Corps also undertakes a diverse range of non-security-related tasks on an &lsquo;as available&rsquo; basis including the provision of air ambulance services to the Health Service Executive (HSE).\u00a0 <\/p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s Aeromedical Desk in its National Emergency Operations Centre is responsible for the co-ordination of all health related air transport which comprises emergency aeromedical support and the inter-hospital service.

The adoption of sanctions requires a unanimous decision of the Council.  As the Deputy will be aware, EU economic sanctions have been in place against Russia since 2014 in response to its illegal annexation of Crimea and its further actions to destabilise Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  To date Ireland has raised its concerns regarding human rights in Russia directly with the Russian authorities and through the EU, the Council of Europe and at the UN Human Rights Council.  In 2016, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted five principles to guide EU relations with Russia.  Key amongst these is strengthening our support for civil society in Russia, a position which Ireland fully endorses.<\/p>  <p>  At the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday Ministers discussed the EU&rsquo;s policy on Russia.  We agreed that the five principles represent a balanced and comprehensive framework for managing our relations with Russia.

The security situation continues to be cause for concern, and developments in the aftermath of legislative elections and in advance of presidential elections are being closely monitored by my Department and by our Embassy in Mexico which is accredited to Colombia.  I condemn unreservedly any such intimidation or violence perpetrated in Colombia and elsewhere.  As the Deputy will agree, peaceful and fair elections are the cornerstone of any democracy and this right must be guaranteed.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has made significant financials contribution in support of the Colombian peace process.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a founder member and one of the largest contributors to the EU Trust Fund for Colombia, which aims to support the implementation of the peace agreement.  We have committed to providing &euro;3 million in funding over the lifetime of the Fund.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in 2017, Ireland contributed &euro;400,000 to the UN Trust Fund for Colombia and &euro;300,000 to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, to assist them in carrying out their vital work in Colombia.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is also funding the secondment of Mr. Pat Colgan as an adviser to the Colombian Ministry for Post-Conflict.  Mr. Colgan was formerly Chief Executive of the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB), which was set up by the British and Irish Governments to manage the PEACE Programmes and INTERREG Programmes in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I firmly believe that Colombia&rsquo;s peace accord provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society for decades can successfully be addressed.  Historic strides have been made to date in its implementation, including the full decommissioning of FARC weapons by July 2017 and the transformation of the organisation into a political party, which as part of the agreement is guaranteed to have five seats in each chamber of the national congress.<\/p>  <p>  We know from our own experience in Ireland that achieving peace can be complex and challenging and is far from straightforward.

rights and obligations of NGOs in consultative status; procedures for withdrawal or suspension of consultative status; the role and functions of the ECOSOC Committee on NGOs; and the responsibilities of the UN Secretariat in supporting the consultative relationship.<\/p>  <p>  Consultative status provides NGOs with access to ECOSOC and to its many subsidiary bodies; to the various human rights mechanisms of the United Nations; ad-hoc processes; and special events organised by the President of the General Assembly.  Currently 4,862 NGOs, including nine Irish NGOs, hold consultative status with ECOSOC.<\/p>  <p>  International, regional, sub regional and national non-governmental and non-profit, public or voluntary organisations may apply for consultative status.  Applications are reviewed by the Committee on NGOs (the Committee), a subsidiary body of ECOSOC, which consists of 19 Member States elected on the basis of equitable geographical representation and which meets twice a year in January and May.  Following review, the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations are forwarded to ECOSOC for decision.<\/p>  <p>  In the course of reviewing an application, the Committee may ask questions or seek clarification from NGOs.  This can often result in a delay in the consideration of individual applications, as the application may then be deferred to the next session.  In relation the specific organisation referred to by the Deputies, I am told that it first submitted its application in 2016 but, because of repeated requests for further information, no recommendation has yet been made.<\/p>  <p>  In the margins of the last meeting of the Committee, when its application was again deferred, officials of the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in New York met with representatives of the organisation, who raised the possibility of appealing directly to ECOSOC.  This course of action has been pursued in recent years in response to similar difficulties encountered by a number of other NGOs.  However, the application must have been rejected by the Committee and, unless ECOSOC decides otherwise, the organisation is then precluded from reapplying for a period of three years.  Moreover, the submission of a resolution to ECOSOC seeking to overturn the decision of the Committee carries no guarantee of success.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the organisation in question, its application has not yet been put to a vote in the Committee and a resolution cannot therefore be brought to ECOSOC at the present time.<\/p>  <p>  It is widely accepted that there is a strong need for significant reform of the United Nations across much of its work and Ireland is committed to supporting Secretary General Guterres in his efforts in this regard.  The Committee on NGOs and the current system of determining NGO consultative status is clearly unwieldy and oversubscribed, and its methods of work need to be revisited.  While there have been some positive developments recently, including webcasting of the Committee&rsquo;s deliberations, which has brought welcome transparency to its processes, there is no doubt that the functioning of the Committee could be improved.<\/p>  <p>  On a more general note, I would like to emphasise our appreciation for the valuable role that civil society actors play in holding countries to account for their human rights records and compliance with their international treaty obligations.  Their participation enriches the deliberations of human rights bodies and my Department regularly includes representatives of civil society in our national delegations to meetings such as the Commission on the Status of Women.<\/p>  <p>  Civil society space is a key priority for Ireland at the Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva.  Recognising the shrinking space for civil society worldwide, Ireland has successfully led on resolutions on the creation and maintenance of safe and enabling environments for civil society space since 2013 and we will again present a resolution on this issue at the next meeting of the HRC in June 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700063#WRE04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Law Reform Commission","counter":377,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700063#WRE04200"},{"type":"question","counter":378,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[15349\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700063#WRE04300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of pieces of legislation both enacted and published by his Department which originated in work carried out by the Law Reform Commission in each of the past ten years in tabular form; the details of each piece of legislation in the corresponding year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":379,"content":"<p>No legislation originating from work carried out by the Law Reform Commission has been enacted by my Department in any of the past ten years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700063#WRE04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700063#WRE04500"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[15389\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700063#WRE04600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to open an embassy in Iran in the near future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":382,"content":"<p>The Embassy of Ireland in Ankara is accredited on a non-residential basis to Iran.

This support includes political efforts to encourage a resumption of direct negotiations, which are ultimately the only way to achieve peace. It also includes action on the ground on human rights and justice issues affecting Palestinians under occupation, including settlement activity, which are progressively endangering the prospects of such a peace agreement.  During my working visit to Israel and Palestine in January, on which I have reported to the House, I met with both President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu, as well as other representatives of the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and discussed with them reinvigorating the effort towards peace in the Middle East.   In recent months the new United States administration has been exploring the possibilities for re-launching the process to reach a comprehensive peace agreement. This engagement is very welcome, and I have met myself with the US team to encourage their work, and to underline to them the key parameters for an agreement which the EU has long espoused. <\/p>  <p>  In recent discussions with my EU colleagues, I have stated that the EU must continue to encourage an appropriate US initiative, but that the EU must also continue our own work, including work on the ground, to help preserve and create the political and physical space in which the two state solution can be achieved, and help to combat negative trends, including the deteriorating situation in Gaza. Recent events in Gaza are a symptom of how difficult the situation there is, and should be a further spur to our efforts to bring about change. I am actively exploring with EU colleagues how this can best be done.<\/p>  <p>  As a part of Ireland&rsquo;s efforts towards helping lay the groundwork for the two state solution, successive Irish Governments have provided financial support to build the institutions of a Palestinian State. Through the Irish Aid programme, which also aims to promote peace building and to meet the immediate needs of the Palestinian people, we currently provide some &euro;10 million annually in development and humanitarian assistance. Ireland&rsquo;s support to the Palestinian Authority has a specific focus on education. <\/p>  <p>  Irish Aid also continues to address the immediate humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people, particularly in Gaza. Ireland has provided funding of &euro;8 million to UNRWA&rsquo;s Gaza Emergency Appeals since 2006, of which &euro;500,000 was provided in 2017.

She made a compelling case in support of her government&rsquo;s assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation was responsible for the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, with a military-grade nerve agent, and that there was no plausible alternative explanation.Having listened to the Prime Minister, and to the views of other Member States in a position to support her account, all EU leaders agreed with the United Kingdom Government&rsquo;s assessment. They also affirmed their unqualified solidarity with the United Kingdom in the face of this grave challenge to Europe&rsquo;s shared security.    The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has since independently confirmed the findings of the UK government relating to the identity of the toxic chemical used in the attack. As I have previously stated, the use of chemical weapons, including the use of any toxic chemicals as weapons, by anyone, anywhere, is shocking and abhorrent. The attack in Salisbury was not just an act against the United Kingdom, it also represented a direct challenge to the international rules-based system on which we all depend for our security and wellbeing.  <\/p>  <p>  In light of the European Council Conclusions, and following an assessment conducted by the Irish security services and relevant Government Departments, I decided to terminate the accreditation of a diplomatic staff member at the Russian Embassy. This decision was not taken lightly. It was based on an assessment of all the relevant political and security factors, and in line with the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. It is noteworthy that a majority of Ireland&rsquo;s closest international partners, both inside and outside the EU responded to the Salisbury attack in a similar manner. I am satisfied that the decision to expel a Russian diplomat was the most appropriate course of action in the circumstances. <\/p>  <p>Ireland has long standing relations with Russia and this year marks the 45th   anniversary of diplomatic relations.

I refer the Deputy to my earlier reply to Question 50 on 28 March last, in relation to this case and to issues affecting children under the military justice system in the Occupied Territory. As I said then, Palestinian children are clearly subject to widespread treatment which Israel would &ndash; correctly &ndash; consider to be unacceptable for its own children. The video footage only reinforces the concerns about this case which I expressed in my earlier replies on this issue.

This was the tenth consecutive decline in this category.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, within the remit of the Central Bank of Ireland's responsibilities for safeguarding stability and protecting consumers; its approach to mortgage arrears resolution is focused on ensuring the fair treatment of borrowers through a strong consumer protection framework and ensuring that lenders have appropriate arrears resolution strategies and operations.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) forms part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Framework.\u00a0 It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, replacing the existing voluntary Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears issued by the Irish Banking Federation.\u00a0 The CCMA has been revised three times since 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013.The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers in financial difficulty are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner by regulated entities and it also includes timelines for regulated entities before they can commence legal proceedings for repossession of a primary residence.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The CCMA also\u00a0includes requirements that repayment arrangements be sustainable and based on a full assessment of the individual circumstances of the borrower and that repossession be used only as a last resort.\u00a0 Borrowers who engage, therefore, benefit from the protections afforded under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), enhancing their chances of remaining in their homes.\u00a0 The MARP process is a four-step process that regulated entities must follow and must consider the most suitable arrangement from the suite of options they offer.\u00a0 Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the range of solutions it offers, which may differ from lender to lender.\u00a0 The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered and this remains a commercial decision for the lender (outside of a Court process such as insolvency).\u00a0 The Central Bank has published guidance for supervisors on what constitutes sustainable mortgage arrears solutions.\u00a0 <\/p><p>At the end of the MARP, regulated entities are required to provide a three-month notice period to allow co-operating borrowers time to consider their options, such as voluntary surrender or an arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act, before legal action can commence.\u00a0 Regarding potential court proceedings for repossession, under the CCMA, a regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession of a primary residence where it has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) with the borrower and other clear requirements are met.\u00a0 This framework requires lenders to exhaust the options available from the suite of ARAs offered before taking action which may result in the borrower losing their home (whether by voluntary sale or repossession).\u00a0 <\/p><p>During the legal process, borrowers have opportunities to re-engage with lenders to find a solution.\u00a0 In some circumstances, however, loss of ownership may be unavoidable.\u00a0 <\/p><p>As I mentioned at the outset,\u00a0a key element of the Central Bank&rsquo;s role is ensuring that the consumer protection regulatory framework is fit for purpose\u00a0so that consumers best interests are protected.\u00a0 To this end, I\u00a0have\u00a0asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the\u00a0CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible and for the review to be completed as soon as possible.<\/p><p>In June 2016, I\u00a0requested the Governor of the Central Bank to provide me with a report detailing the mortgage restructuring activity within banks and non-banks, the range of solutions offered by non-banks, assessing the range of solutions that may affect borrowers&rsquo; capacity to remain in their primary residences, and whether these are addressing the requirements of over-indebted borrowers.\u00a0\u00a0In that Report, the\u00a0Central Bank stated\u00a0&lsquo;While repossession proceedings should only be initiated following the MARP, the ability to undertake secured lending is ultimately dependent on the institution&rsquo;s right to realise the security if needed and to price accordingly.\u00a0 This is a cornerstone of secured lending and, by extension, an effectively functioning mortgage market&rsquo;.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Central Bank further stated that &lsquo;Overall, there is strong evidence that banks and non-banks are looking to exhaust available options before moving into the legal process&rsquo;.<\/p><p>Finally, across state agencies, there are numerous bodies and processes in place to assist those in mortgage arrears in the hope of avoiding repossession. The Abhaile service was established to\u00a0offer help borrowers in arrears to find the best solutions and to keep them, if possible, in their own homes. This is assisting borrowers, particularly those in longer term arrears. A dedicated adviser will work with borrowers in arrears and their lender to find the best solution for them. Borrowers can get free advice from an expert financial adviser who can help them to work through their financial situation. An Expert adviser could be from MABS or a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) or an accountant. Borrowers may also need legal advice and under Abhaile they can have a free meeting with a solicitor. If called to court to face repossession proceedings on their home, they will be able to meet a Duty Solicitor at the court. A MABS staff member will also be present at court to help them.<\/p><p>A Helpline\u00a0is available Monday to Friday and\u00a0a face-to-face service which is completely free, confidential and independent is also available in more than 60 MABS locations nationwide.<\/p><p><b>Central Bank - Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossession Statistics <\/b><\/p><p><b>Family homes that have been repossessed by financial institutions 2009-2017 <\/b><table><tr><th>Year <\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Repossessions<\/td><td>211<\/td><td>362<\/td><td>608<\/td><td>603<\/td><td>766<\/td><td>1,311<\/td><td>1,535<\/td><td>1,693<\/td><td>1,417<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700065#WRG04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":471,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700065#WRG04700"},{"type":"question","counter":472,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[16067\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700065#WRG04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if VAT charges will be removed from the rental of disability aids during the interim period when the person is awaiting the delivery or installation of same; the reason that when disability aids are purchased, they are exempted from VAT but VAT is charged when hiring disability aids; and his views on whether this charge should be removed or reimbursed to persons who had to await delivery and installation of the disability aid.","asker":"1305","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":473,"content":"<p>I am advised by The Revenue Commissioners that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.

The decision is made within the context that both the Central Bank and SIPTU agreed to attend the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) on Monday 16 April, and the Central Bank will not take any immediate steps to implement this proposal to allow time for a Workplace Relations Commission process.  The cessation of the printing of banknotes by the Central Bank of Ireland will have no impact on the supply of banknotes in Ireland, as the majority of banknotes used in Ireland are already produced elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  This proposal to source banknotes from a third party in the euro area is in line with the approach taken by many other national central banks.  The proposal includes the retention of a specialist team of technically competent staff, which will ensure the Bank can continue to meet its Eurosystem obligations and contribute to the design and sourcing of banknotes.  There will be no impact on the production of Irish euro coins or the supply of cash to the national cash cycle, and the Central Bank&rsquo;s Currency Centre will continue to provide services such as coinage, circulated banknote processing and related operations.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has been engaging with impacted staff and their representative union on these matters.  The Central Bank is committed to continuing this engagement and, with the agreement of SIPTU, has entered into a Workplace Relations Commission process with the representative union.  The Central Bank is not seeking redundancies and is confident that any staff directly impacted by these proposals can be redeployed into other roles.  Directly impacted staff who wish to leave the Central Bank would be offered voluntary severance.<\/p>  <p>  As I have stated both the Central Bank and SIPTU\u00a0have entered into a Workplace Relations Commission process on the matter\u00a0where the issue will be discussed\u00a0in a robust and meaningful way.

When first announced, the stated purposes of individualisation were to ease the burden on single persons which accounted for 65% of the work force, to take workers on the average industrial wage out of the higher rate of tax and more generally to facilitate a reduction in the numbers paying tax at the higher rate.  Prior to this, a second spouse faced the marginal rate of tax on the first euro (or Punt as it was then) earned in his or her own name.<\/p>  <p>  Individualisation was progressed to some extent in later years but never completed.  The result is that we now have a hybrid system.  Up to &euro;9,000 of the standard-rate band can be transferred between spouses and the married personal tax credit can be allocated in full to one spouse.  Because the income tax system allows married couples to choose whether to be jointly or individually assessed, there can be a difference between the tax liabilities incurred by married couples on the same household income, depending on the method of assessment chosen.<\/p>  <p>  However, in lieu of\u00a0fully transferable rate bands,\u00a0a Home Carer Tax Credit may be claimed where one spouse works primarily in the home to care for a dependent person, such as a child.  This credit was introduced in the context of the move towards individualisation, in recognition of the choices made by families where one spouse stays at home to care for children or the elderly. <\/p>  <p>  This credit was increased in both Budgets 2016 and 2017, and it now stands at &euro;1,100 per year, effectively allowing the credit to shelter family income of &euro;5,500 from taxation.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of tax individualisation was assessed and considered by the Commission on Taxation in 2009, that body recommended that no change should be made to the current system.

The Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) framework sets out the steps which lenders must follow.  A lender must carry out an affordability assessment by examining each case on its own merits and must base its assessment of the borrower's full circumstances including their ability to repay as determined by up to date information on a Standard Financial Statement (SFS). A lender must explore all options for alternative repayment arrangements (that they offer) in order to offer the most viable option to each borrower.  The Code also requires lenders to review an alternative repayment arrangement at appropriate intervals for the type and duration of the arrangement.  The lender is also obliged to carry out a review of an alternative repayment arrangement at any time, if requested by the borrower. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Central Bank that there\u00a0is a broad range of available restructures offered and delivered by both bank and non-bank entities and there is strong evidence that both banks and non-banks look to exhaust available restructure options before moving to the legal process. <\/p><p>The Deputy\u00a0will be aware\u00a0of the\u00a0Abhaile mortgage arrears resolution service, established to ensure that those either in mortgage arrears or\u00a0at risk of going into mortgage arrears on their primary residence, are able to access State-funded professional legal or financial advice on their resolution options.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The aim of Abhaile is to help mortgage holders in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, wherever possible, in their own homes.  The service is proving very successful in assisting distressed borrowers, particularly those in longer term mortgage arrears.  A dedicated adviser will work with borrowers in mortgage arrears and their lender to find the best solution for their situation. \u00a0<\/p><p>If those in mortgage arrears need financial advice, they can get a free face to face meeting with an expert financial adviser.  The adviser can help them to work through their financial situation and explain the options available to them to help deal with their home mortgage arrears.\u00a0 The expert adviser could be a MABS Money Adviser, a MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears adviser, a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) or an accountant.<\/p><p>Distressed borrowers may also need legal advice on issues related to their mortgage arrears.  Under Abhaile they can have a free face-to-face meeting with a solicitor, who will explain their legal situation and advise them how best to resolve it.<\/p><p>If they are called to court to face repossession proceedings on their home, they will be able to meet a Duty Solicitor at the court.

This began with the updating of the rules for the sale of financial instruments under Markets in Financial Instruments Directive\u00a0(MiFID II)\u00a0and is also a focus of the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD).  The aim of European legislation in these areas is to provide transparency and clarity to the consumer around the advice they are being given.  A way of achieving this is to bring in more stringent requirements around how sellers of such products can receive fees or inducements from third parties.  There is also a need to ensure a level playing field for all the providers of products, such as insurance or financial instruments, which can be interchangeable in a number of cases. <\/p><p>Ireland is implementing the improvements in consumer protection via the transposition of MiFID II, IDD and amendments to the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code 2012. <\/p><p>MiFID II, which gives protection for investors in financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or derivatives came into effect on 03 January 2018.  Under the legislation, authorised investment firms are banned from accepting fees, commissions or other non-monetary benefits when giving &ldquo;independent&rdquo; investment advice.  The exception is where the non-monetary benefit is minor and is of benefit to the quality of service that the firm provides.<\/p><p>Under MiFID II, I exercised the discretion to allow certain firms such as those authorised under the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995, many of whom are small brokers servicing local markets, to be exempt from the full MiFID II requirements.  However, these firms must be subject to strict rules around consumer protection that are deemed &ldquo;analogous&rdquo; to the MiFID II rules including those around the acceptance of fees and commissions.  To ensure that these firms are covered by analogous rules, the Central Bank updated its Consumer Protection Code (2012) in this area in November 2017.  Under the Code, product producers must be able to demonstrate that any commission arrangements based on levels of business introduced do not impair the intermediary's duty to act in the best interests of the consumers and do not give rise to a conflict of interest between the intermediary and the consumer.<\/p><p>IDD replaces the Insurance Mediation Directive which currently regulates point of sale insurance products and following the Council of the European Union&rsquo;s adoption of a Commission proposal must be transposed by 1 July 2018 and implemented by Member States by 1 October 2018.  My Department is currently progressing the transposition of IDD and is liaising with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and the Central Bank with a view to publishing the transposing Regulations well in advance of the deadline.<\/p><p>IDD contains a number of national discretions including in the area of fees, commissions or other non-monetary benefits which are open to Member States to adopt if they so wish.  My Department carried out a public consultation on these discretions in April 2017 and submissions were received from Insurance Ireland, Irish Life Group and Brokers Ireland.<\/p><p>It should be noted that there is an overlap between IDD and MiFID II insofar as &quot;functionally equivalent&quot; or substitutable investment products can be sold under either Directive.\u00a0 Therefore, in order to ensure a level playing field for such\u00a0products, I have decided to exercise part of the discretion in Article 29(3) of IDD to prohibit the acceptance and retaining of fees, commissions or non-monetary benefits from third parties in relation to the provision of independent advice for insurance-based investment products.\u00a0 As there is no level playing field issue with insurance products in general, the discretion in Article 22(3) is not being availed of at this time, but will be considered further after the Central Bank consultation on Intermediary Inducements is completed later this year. <\/p><p>You should also be aware that in transposing the IDD, in the main, I have\u00a0decided to avail of discretions that allow for the continuation of the current regulatory framework, rather than add to the regulatory burden. <\/p><p>Finally, I will further consider these discretions following the completion of the Central Bank's work in this area.  In this regard, you should note that the Bank issued a Consultation Paper in November, which contains proposals to enhance the protections for consumers when seeking advice from financial intermediaries.  This includes proposals for stricter rules on how financial intermediaries can be paid commission (or other inducements) by the firms whose products they sell. \u00a0The proposed measures require firms to avoid conflicts of interest created by poorly designed inducement arrangements and provide greater transparency for consumers about how a financial intermediary, whose advice they are relying on, is getting paid. <\/p><p>The Central Bank's consultation process closed on 22 March 2018 and my officials will examine the Central Banks&rsquo; analysis once they have completed their work and in due course advise me accordingly. <\/p><p>Insurance-based investment products are defined in the legislation as &ldquo;an insurance product which offers a maturity or surrender value and where that maturity or surrender value is wholly or partially exposed, directly or indirectly, to market fluctuations&rdquo; with certain exclusions such as pension products, non-life insurance products as listed in Annex I of the Solvency Directive; as well as life insurance contracts where the benefits under the contract are payable only on death or in respect of incapacity due to injury, sickness or disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700068#WRK02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Investment Incentive Scheme","counter":608,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700068#WRK03000"},{"type":"question","counter":609,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[16104\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700068#WRK03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the delays in the Revenue Commissioners issuing certificates for the employment investment incentive scheme to enable qualifying persons apply for refunds in respect of 2017; the steps being taken to address the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":610,"content":"<p>I am aware of the current position regarding the delays in issuing Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) certificates to investors. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue has informed me that the increased complexity of the scheme, arising from changes in Finance Act 2015 and 2017, means that each application takes longer to process than in previous years.\u00a0 The increased complexity also results in a large number of incomplete applications being made, which in turn increases the volume of correspondence dealt with by the processing team.<\/p>  <p>  To address this, last December Revenue issued a revised application form, which clearly outlines all of the information required, and additional staff members are being assigned to the processing district.\u00a0 In addition, and as the Deputy\u00a0may be aware, I announced that a review of EII was to be carried out this year.\u00a0 The review will examine\u00a0a range of aspects of the incentive including whether\u00a0whether the operational design of the scheme can be improved upon.

I examined the ten policy options that were put forward in the report in the context of the limited tax expenditure resources that were available to me for Budget 2018.\u00a0 As the Deputy mentions, the report put forward options for further consideration, rather than recommendations, and any further consideration would require the participation of several Departments and organisations, including my own Department.<\/p>  <p>  The ten options are split into short, medium and long-term options. Five potential short-term options were identified as measures which could potentially be implemented within 18 months, i.e. within Budgets 2018 and 2019.  I introduced one of these options in Budget 2018 - deductibility for pre-letting expenditure for previously vacant properties.  This measure applies to residential premises which have been vacant for at least 12 months and which are then let after the date of the passing of the Finance Act 2017, i.e. after 25 December 2017.  The expenditure is allowed as a deduction against rental income from that premises.  It applies to expenses that would be allowable if they had been incurred while the property was let, such as the cost of repairs, insurance, maintenance and management of the property.\u00a0\u00a0Certain limitations are in place regarding this measure, for example the expenditure must have been incurred in the 12 months before the premises is let as a residential premises. \u00a0The total deduction allowed is capped at &euro;5,000 per vacant premises and the deduction will be clawed-back if the property ceases to be let as a residential premises within four years of the first letting.  I prioritised this option as it was specifically designed to encourage an overall increase in housing supply by bringing currently vacant property back into residential use.<\/p>  <p>  Another short-term option was to improve the collection and sharing of data on the rental accommodation sector.\u00a0 A significant issue that hampered the progress of the Working Group was a lack of robust data on various elements of the housing market, due to the differing metrics used by the various agencies.  The Housing Analytics Group, chaired by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, is currently active and a number of Departments and agencies are involved in its work, including the Residential Tenancies Board, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Revenue and the Department of Finance.  The guiding principle for the Group is that housing policy requires the best evidence available to inform analysis, forecasts and decisions.  The Group&rsquo;s initial focus is to review the various sources of housing and housing related data collected nationally.  Once gaps or deficiencies have been identified the Group will make recommendations for improvement.<\/p>  <p>  A further short-term option was to increase the mortgage interest deduction available to landlords.\u00a0 In this context it should be noted that in Budget 2017, a phased unwinding of the restriction on interest deductibility over five years for all residential landlords was provided for.  The second step, an increase from 80% to 85% deductibility, took effect from 1 January 2018.\u00a0 It was decided not to further accelerate this deduction in Budget 2018 as to do so would have undermined the social housing tenancies incentive introduced in Finance Act 2015, which allows 100% mortgage interest deductibility where a landlord commits to let their property to social housing tenants for a minimum of 3 years.  As of June 2017, the total number of tenancies registered for the scheme was 2,277.<\/p>  <p>  Another short-term option identified by the Group was to consider introducing Local Property Tax (LPT) deductibility for landlords with an estimated cost of &euro;28 million in a full year. In view of this cost, and the recommendation of Dr. Thornhill, in his 2015 review of the LPT, which recommended that a deduction should not be allowed because the concept of the LPT is linked to the amenity value of residential property which is of benefit to the tenant in addition to the landlord, I do not believe it is appropriate to allow a deduction for LPT at this time. <\/p>  <p>  Five of the options put forward in the report were medium-term and long-term options.  Medium-term options are measures which work with the current tax system but might take longer to develop and implement, and as such would require a longer lead-in period.  The long-term options look at the potential for more fundamental changes to the tax system, and so would require significantly greater resource commitments to progress.\u00a0 Consideration of these options will continue within the relevant time frames.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost rental and overall housing supply and that, in line with the Tax Expenditure Guidelines, consideration of whether a tax measure is the most appropriate policy tool for a given purpose would be required. Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention in the rental sector.  There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce and the rental sector is just one of many other sectors that may require assistance and intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700069#WRL02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":646,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700069#WRL02500"},{"type":"question","counter":647,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[16430\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700069#WRL02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of clerical officers and clerical assistants in his Department on temporary contracts by years of service; if these officers will be offered permanent positions in the Civil Service when they have served a fixed period of time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":648,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that under a restructuring agreement in 1997 the Clerical Assistant Grade was abolished.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance currently has one Clerical Officer on a temporary contract since February, 2018.

In this regard, the initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.\u00a0 The second phase of the Cost of Insurance Working Group under the Chairmanship of the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, recently concluded its report in relation to employer liability and public liability insurance.\u00a0 This Report acknowledges that many of the difficulties being faced by business are also impacting community groups such as men&rsquo;s sheds. <\/p>  <p>  The Working Group&rsquo;s Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions to be carried out.  The recommendations and actions are detailed in an action plan contained in the report with agreed timelines for implementation.\u00a0 The recommendations, covering three main themes, include actions to:<\/p>  <p>  - Increase Transparency: enhance levels of transparency and improve data sharing and collection processes;<\/p>  <p>  - Review the level of damages in personal injury cases: request that the Law Reform Commission undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries; and<\/p>  <p>  - Improve the personal injuries litigation framework: through a number of measures, namely: <\/p>  <p>  (a)\u00a0\u00a0 ensuring potential defendants are notified in sufficient time that an incident has occurred in relation to which a claim is going to be made against their policy; <\/p>  <p>  (b)\u00a0\u00a0 tackling fraudulent or exaggerated claims; and <\/p>  <p>  (c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ensuring suitable training and information supports are available to the judiciary to assist in the fair and consistent assessment and awarding of damages in personal injury cases.<\/p>  <p>  The primary focus of these reports was to examine the cost of insurance for motorists and for businesses in particular.\u00a0 Having said that, it is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations from the two Reports cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, will also beneficially impact community, voluntary and charitable organisations.  The objective of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and businesses, including those in the community and voluntary sector remains\u00a0the desired policy goal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700069#WRL04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Rebates","counter":661,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700069#WRL04300"},{"type":"question","counter":662,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[16749\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700069#WRL04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a refund of income tax is due in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":663,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the person in question is a PAYE taxpayer who to date has not requested a review of their tax situation.<\/p><p>If the person wishes to initiate a review of their tax liability, they can either request an\u00a0End of Year Statement (P21) or complete a\u00a0Form 12.

However any non-compliance, by even a minority of individuals or sectors, deprives the Exchequer of much needed funds and puts compliant businesses at a competitive disadvantage.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  For these reasons, Revenue is very focused on ensuring all taxpayers and businesses, including those in the farm contracting sector, complete their tax requirements in full and on time.

In under-payment situations, Revenue will always seek to collect interest and penalties in addition to the outstanding tax.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has assured me that the farm contracting sector is subjected to the same risk-based scrutiny as every other sector of the economy and is liable to the same level of sanction where non-compliance is discovered.  Also, compliant agricultural contractors can play a vital part in assuring a level playing field in the sector by providing Revenue (including anonymously) with any information they may have in regard to persons engaged in non-compliant practices.

The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million.

Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children.  <\/p><p>No school, has lost supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school received an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year.  <\/p><p>An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model. The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  <\/p><p>The additional funding provided additional supports to over 1300 schools who identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model while ensuring that no school received a reduced allocation.<\/p><p>The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support.  <\/p><p>In relation to the school referred to by the Deputy, the profiling model had indicated a profiled special educational need for this school of 47.5 teaching hours. <\/p><p>However, as no school received an allocation, on the introduction of the new model, which was less than the allocation they received in the previous school year, the school maintained an allocation of 53.6 hours and it was indicated that within this allocation there was a retained element of 6.1 hrs. This equates to over 2 full time special education teachers in the school and is a very significant allocation for a school of this size.<\/p><p>The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.<\/p><p>Under the new allocation model, schools have been provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile.  <\/p><p>Included within this is an allocation for: <\/p><p>- A school educational profile component; which includes:<\/p><p>- An allocation for pupils with complex needs<\/p><p>- The learning support needs in schools as evidenced by attainment levels in standardised test results<\/p><p>- The social context of the school including disadvantage and gender<\/p><p>- Baseline component provided to every mainstream school to support inclusion, prevention of learning difficulties and early intervention. <\/p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school.<b><\/b><\/p><p>It is acknowledged and accepted that schools will have some additional pupils with special educational needs enrolling to their school subsequent to the profiles having been developed. <\/p><p>However, for the most part these will be balanced by the fact that some students who had additional teaching needs in the previous year will have left the school. The baseline is also designed to ensure that schools have some capacity to provide additional support to pupils. <\/p><p>Where a school profile significantly changes following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increase year on year additional allocations may be made. <\/p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in DES Circular 17\/2017 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) and DES 10,11,12\/2017 (Post Primary School Staffing Schedule).<\/p><p>Schools who qualified for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualified for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. <\/p><p>It is also acknowledged that there will be some schools where exceptional circumstances may arise. <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will be available to support schools where schools have developed and implemented appropriate plans for the deployment of their special education needs teaching resources, but the school considers that further support may be required. This support may involve Continuing Professional Development or further training for school staff, advice in relation to the support plans that are in place, and possibly a review process once schools can clearly demonstrate that exceptional circumstances have arisen in the school. <\/p><p>The NCSE has also now published details of how schools can seek a review of their allocations, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  <\/p><p>Should schools consider that they fulfil the criteria for a review on the grounds of exceptional circumstances, details of this review process are available at:<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>The NCSE has reviewed an application from the school concerned for a review on the grounds of exceptional needs and has advised that it was not considered that the school required a review of its allocation. A review on the grounds of exceptional circumstances arising will only be conducted where the school profile changes very significantly, beyond which the school profile is provided to cater for, or where very exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school beyond a schools capacity to provide additional teaching support once their allocations are utilised effectively.<\/p><p>The NCSE has advised, however, that they will be in a position to provide additional guidance or support for this school and to discuss any issues which the school may have in managing their available resources, and to assist the school in managing the utilisation of their allocation to support all children who need additional teaching support in the school, should the school wish to avail of such support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700072#WRO04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"DEIS Status","counter":798,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700072#WRO04400"},{"type":"question","counter":799,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[15062\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700072#WRO04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the way in which a school (details supplied) can apply for DEIS status; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1267","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":800,"content":"<p>Schools are not required to make an application for inclusion in the DEIS programme as all schools are assessed using a\u00a0new uniform identification model.<\/p><p>We have, for the first time, introduced an objective, statistics based model for deciding which schools merit inclusion in the DEIS Programme, so that all stakeholders can have confidence that we are targeting extra resources at those schools with the highest concentrated levels of disadvantage.

The number of special classes has risen by 712 since 2011, including 277 new classes in the past two years. <\/p><p>Most children with special education needs attend mainstream class, but some require the environment of a special class.

Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:<\/p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused\u00a0capacity within a school or schools<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a\u00a0school or schools<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or\u00a0schools.<\/p>  <p>  Where the requirement for a new school is established, my Department engages with the relevant local authority under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Minister for Education and Skills and the County and City Managers' Association on the acquisition of sites for school planning purposes.  The MOU allows my Department to harness local authorities' long-standing experience and knowledge in respect of planning, property and acquisitions generally.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of provision of schools for south County Kildare, there\u00a0is ongoing engagement with Kildare County Council at a senior level in respect of current and future school site requirements.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700074#WRQ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Eligibility","counter":883,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700074#WRQ03700"},{"type":"question","counter":884,"qnumday":361,"qnumall":"[15440\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700074#WRQ03800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the case of a person (details supplied) will be reviewed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":885,"content":"<p>Very significant numbers of third-level students move out of home to go to college and continue to be supported by their parents while in full-time education.

Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, both with the Education and Training Boards in the initial phase to establish evidence of demand by consulting pre-school parents and subsequently through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body.  <\/p>  <p>  In that process, the existing patron will also take into account proposals from all prospective multi-denominational patrons that wish to be considered.

The strategy sets out 12 inter- related elements which aim to promote, develop and encourage literacy and numeracy skills in the adult population.  Progress to date includes the development and launch of the national awareness campaign, &lsquo;take the first step&rsquo;, development of national guidelines for the initial and on-going screening and assessment of participants and the publication of a number of research projects including the examination of integrating literacy and numeracy in FET programmes and an examination of barriers to participation in FET programmes .<\/p>  <p>  Adult literacy provision is delivered through a number of dedicated programmes including adult literacy groups and intensive tuition in adult basic education.  Last year, over &euro;33million was provided to support adult literacy and numeracy provision for over 60,000 beneficiaries.  The detail of resourcing and planned beneficiary numbers for overall adult literacy provision is not yet finalised, but will be similar to that provided last year.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing participation in life-long learning is a key priority for this Government.  The Higher Education System Performance Framework 2018-20, which I published earlier this year,\u00a0reinforces the target set in the National Skills Strategy 2025,\u00a0to increase by 10% the number of those aged 25-64 engaged in lifelong learning by 2020 and by 15% by 2025.  Lifelong learning can comprise\u00a0formal, non-formal and informal learning.  Research findings have indicated that lowering the barriers to adult participation in learning calls for increased modes of delivery that help overcome time constraints.  Flexibility in FET provision will continue to be expanded and enhanced.\u00a0 Last year almost 160, 000 beneficiaries engaged on part time FET programmes &ndash; of which 15,000 were facilitated through evening training and a further 10,000 online through eCollege.  As part of the National Strategy for Higher Education and the implementation of a system performance framework for the sector HEIs have agreed objectives for access and lifelong learning with the Higher Education Authority (HEA).

Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more pupils, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with the parents, teachers, staff and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a pupil suffers from an illness requiring medication, that appropriate treatment is available.<\/p>  <p>  The administration of medicines in primary schools is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) and the organisations representing school management at primary level. While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so. <\/p>  <p>  Where a child requires adult assistance to administer medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of pupil\/pupils for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school when appointing an SNA. <\/p>  <p>  Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner. It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally. <\/p>  <p>  It is my Department's experience that once the matter has been discussed in detail with the Board of Management and staff of a school, and once all parties are clear as to the procedures to be followed, arrangements can normally be made to administer the type of medicine which may be required.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2016, I requested the NCSE to lead a comprehensive review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme to identify and recommend how, in the future, the additional care needs of students, over and above those needs that could be reasonably expected to be managed by teaching staff, should be met and to identify and recommend the most appropriate form of support options to provide better outcomes for students with Special Educational Needs who have additional care needs, having regard to the significant amount of State investment in this area.<\/p>  <p>  The administration of medication and other such issues in schools, has been raised with the NCSE as part of the consultation process of this review.<\/p>  <p>  In May 2017 the NCSE brought forward a number of recommendations which were urgent, the first related to the need to set up a separate review group to identify options for an alternate and improved model for providing care supports and the second, proposed a separate review of provision for children with complex medical needs. <\/p>  <p>  Separate Working Groups undertook that work over the months since the NCSEs recommendations and reports of those working groups have been finalised. <\/p>  <p>  The full report of the SNA Comprehensive Review, which will be informed by the Report from the Working Group\u00a0 to consider an alternative model of SNA allocation and the working group on Nursing Supports for students with complex medical needs has now been submitted to my office and its contents are under consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700081#WRX01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Site Acquisitions","counter":1191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700081#WRX01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1192,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[16667\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700081#WRX01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress made in locating a permanent site for a school (details supplied); if Dublin City Council has secured such a site; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1193,"content":"<p>A\u00a0site has been identified to accommodate a permanent school building for the school to which the Deputy\u00a0refers.

There are currently no traineeships in the farm contracting sector but employers, or employer representative bodies, interested in creating a new traineeship in this sector should contact their local ETB.<\/p><p><b>Proposed Apprenticeships in the Farming Sector<\/b><table><tr><th>Proposed Apprenticeship<\/th><th>Proposed Level on the National Framework of Qualifications<\/th><th>Proposed Duration<\/th><th>Proposer\/Industry Lead<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><br \/><br \/>Agriculture<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td rowspan=\"8\"><br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>                        Teagasc<br \/><br \/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Farm Technician<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>2 years<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Farm Manager<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>2 years<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/><br \/>Equine<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sportsturf Management<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>2 years<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Stud Farm Management<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>2 years<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/><br \/>Horticulture<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Applied Horticulture<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>2 years<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700081#WRX02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":1209,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700081#WRX02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1210,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[16758\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700081#WRX03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position in relation to the allocation of teachers to a school (details supplied) in County Cork for the 2018-2019 school year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1211,"content":"<p>The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.

A PIA is the insolvency solution most suited to a borrower in Mortgage Arrears on their family home. Under section 104 of the Personal Insolvency Acts, the personal insolvency practitioner (PIP) preparing a personal insolvency proposal has a duty, as far as reasonably practicable, to design it on terms which will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in their principal private residence or to cease to occupy it.  There are exceptions to this obligation only where the costs of remaining in the home are disproportionately large, taking account of all relevant matters, or where the debtor instructs the PIP in writing that he or she does not want to remain in the home.<\/p><p>To facilitate access to the PIA as an option for borrowers where repossession proceedings have been initiated, legislation was enacted in 2013, namely, the Land and Conveyancing Amendment Act, to specifically provide for an adjournment of a repossession court case in order to allow for a homeowner to apply for a PIA which would keep them in their home. <\/p><p>The section 115A court review process was introduced with effect from November 2015.  Under this provision, where a creditor or creditors refuse a proposed personal insolvency arrangement which includes mortgage arrears on the debtor&rsquo;s home, the Court can be asked to review the creditors&rsquo; refusal. Where the Court is satisfied that the proposal is overall fair and reasonable, it has power to impose it on the creditors.  This effectively removes the so-called &ldquo;Bank Veto&rdquo;.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) publishes statistics relating to all available statutory personal insolvency solutions (including PIAs) on its website on a quarterly basis: therefore, the statistics sought by the Deputy are already published. <\/p><p>The following are the statistics requested.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>Personal Insolvency Arrangements Approved by Year<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>PIA<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>126<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>619<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>697<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>733<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>2175<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>This total of 2175 personal insolvency arrangements approved includes PIAs that have been imposed by the Courts under the section 115A court review process. <\/p><p>A significant number of section 115A cases have been pending before the Courts, awaiting the High Court judgment in the Meeley, Taafe and Foye cases which was delivered on 5 February 2018. Effectively, many s. 115A cases were being adjourned before the Courts pending the outcome of two technical and procedural challenges brought by creditors, which were addressed by this judgment. <\/p><p>The Meeley judgment confirmed and developed earlier High Court decisions on the parties entitled to bring section 115A applications. It also confirmed and developed earlier High Court decisions which held  that creditors are not entitled to seek their legal costs against a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) personally in a s. 115A application, save in 'highly exceptional' situations such as bad faith by the PIP concerned.<\/p><p>Subject to any possible appeal of the Meeley judgment, it is expected that these outstanding court review cases can now be resolved.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland, which is a notice party to all s. 115A applications, indicates that some 560 such cases are currently pending before the courts. The ISI has stated that it expects the number of section 115A cases brought and decided to rise sharply during 2018. <\/p><p>In addition, my Department is currently finalising a review of Part 3 of the Personal Insolvency Acts, which includes reviewing the operation of personal insolvency arrangements.

Issues of community identify and numbers of potential participants on GYDPs in the area will be key considerations here.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of GYDP services in all parts of the State has obvious advantages, particularly in terms of providing services for significant numbers of young people who cannot currently access them.  In this regard, an independent evaluation report of the operation of an integrated approach to delivery of GYDP services within County Kerry, commissioned by my Department is expected to be finalised shortly.  This report will help with the further development GYDP services in the context of the Call for Proposals.<\/p>  <p>  GYDPs deliver valuable services for young people who have committed a crime or may be at risk of offending as well as providing important support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at local level.  I can assure the Deputy that in the context of the Call for Proposals my Department is committed to ensuring continuity of service for participants on GYDPs and maintain a community driven approach to their operation, as well as minimising any disruption for workers and service providers.  In this regard, and in line with the overall objective of providing GYDP services to all children and young persons who require them, I am advised that the Call for Proposals will require applicants to provide for continuity of GYDP services for young people currently participating in the service.  Furthermore, the Call for Proposals process will facilitate existing service providers forming consortiums, which could apply to provide services under the new comprehensive approach that is being developed.<\/p>  <p>  GYDPs provide an effective and essential support to the operation of the statutory Garda Diversion Programme by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The principal focus of GYDPs is on young people who receive a Garda caution under the Diversion Programme for involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour and are referred to a local GYDP (primary referrals).  GYDPs also accommodate a certain proportion of young people who are considered to be at risk of involvement in offending or anti-social behaviour (secondary referrals).<\/p>  <p>  In relation to secondary referrals, it has to be considered if, in principle, it is appropriate to refer a child to a Garda project where no criminal act has been identified.  For some, a better option might be referral to available mainstream youth services that could appropriately support them.  That being said, it is accepted that referrals to GYDPs must take account of local needs and issues in relation to access and availability of mainstream youth services.  Following the Call for Proposals process, GYDP services will still accommodate a certain proportion of secondary referrals and the proportion of these may vary from area to area depending on identified local needs.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is very much aware of the range of concerns expressed in relation to the Call for Proposals process.  I can assure the Deputy that careful consideration is being given to all issues raised by stakeholders involved in GYDPs, including those of independent service providers, as part of the extensive consultation process which is currently ongoing.  This process includes arrangements for an extensive series of meetings with community based organisations and project workers which will facilitate closer communication and exchange of information in relation to these matters.  In addition, the consultations will include arrangements to hear the views of young people, including participants or former participants on GYDPs.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the new approach to GYDP provision which is being developed in preparation for the Call for Proposals will not reduce the level of service that already exists, or the importance of community involvement in its delivery.  On the contrary, the intention is to build on, update and improve a very valuable service so that it is available to every child or young person in the country who requires it.  This improvement to the service will have benefits for significant numbers of young people in the State who cannot currently access GYDP services.  While certain aspects of the new service model have been determined, work is ongoing to complete the full details to be included in the Call for Proposals, which is expected to issue in the second quarter of this year.  I am convinced that community ownership and participation of the projects is an essential dimension that must be preserved and strengthened in the working out of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700083#WRZ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"question","counter":1309,"qnumday":510,"qnumall":"[15126\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700083#WRZ03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to ensure that TUPE regulations will be implemented for all staff of the Garda youth diversion projects regarding the change of the service delivery model; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1310,"content":"<p>As the Deputy\u00a0will be aware my Department is obliged\u00a0to carry out a Call for Proposals process during 2018 in relation to\u00a0the provision of Garda Youth Diversion Project\u00a0(GYDP) services, to fully comply with requirements related to the co-funding of projects by the European Social Fund Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to\u00a0ensuring continuity of service for participants on all GYDPs and to maintaining a community driven approach to their operation, as well as minimising any disruption for workers and service providers.

The estimated cost of the core safety camera service over 6 years is approximately &euro;73 million\u00a0excluding VAT (Total cost of the safety camera contract over 7 years is estimated at &euro;100.4 million, including VAT). This represents a reduction of approximately 14% when compared with the cost which would have arisen over that time based on the charges under the previous contract. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the\u00a0current contract, GoSafe will provide an annual minimum of 90,000 hours of monitoring and surveying vehicle speed across 1,031 designated safety camera zones. This equates to a minimum of 7,400 monitoring hours and 100 survey hours a month. This represents an annual increase of 300 hours on the\u00a0previous contract.\u00a0 The\u00a0current contract also contains provisions for up to 1,500 additional monitoring hours within any calendar month and the option to avail of fixed, temporary fixed and average speed safety camera systems.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The role of the Safety Camera Contract is critical in the context of road traffic enforcement, improving\u00a0road safety by changing driver behaviour in order to reduce road traffic fatalities and serious injuries by reducing the incidence of drivers exceeding stipulated speed limits, in circumstances where speeding is known to be a significant factor behind serious collisions. As such, the deployment of safety cameras is determined by road safety considerations as opposed to revenue maximisation. <\/p>  <p>  The overall impact of the safety cameras can be seen in the impact on the fatal collisions in the designated safety camera zones, referred to as speed enforcement zones. The designation of specific sections of road as speed enforcement zones is based on an analysis of collision data by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In the years 2004 to 2009 (the 6 years before the introduction of the safety camera network began), approximately 3 out of 10 (30%) fatal collisions occurred in these zones. In 2015, this figure had reduced to 16% (or 24 road deaths) in safety camera zones.<\/p>  <p>  The safety camera network has made a critical contribution to road traffic enforcement and, by extension, road safety, since its inception, and will continue to\u00a0provide valuable support to\u00a0An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of roads policing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700085#WRBB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Penalty Points System Data","counter":1392,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700085#WRBB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1393,"qnumday":540,"qnumall":"[15634\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700085#WRBB01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of penalty points accumulated for speeding during 2017; the number of speeding fines paid during 2017; the amount in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1394,"content":"<p>I have requested a report from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the statistics sought by the Deputy and I will be in contact with the Deputy directly on receipt of a Garda report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700085#WRBB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":1395,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700085#WRBB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1396,"qnumday":541,"qnumall":"[15657\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700085#WRBB01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on the matter of drug dealers who are informers being allowed to sell drugs in communities; if this is an official policy; if his attention has been drawn to the prevalence of this policy and the quantity of illegal drugs sold here annually due to this policy; and the steps he has taken to measure the impact of this policy on local communities.","asker":"1235","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1397,"content":"<p>I have raised the matter referred to by the Deputy with the Garda Authorities and requested a report on the issue.

video cameras except where\u00a0the recording activity relates to an individual's own personal, family or recreational activities. The\u00a0recording of images in public places by means of CCTV\u00a0systems is, therefore, a form of personal data processing that is covered by\u00a0general data protection rules and safeguards. That will continue to be the case under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will enter into effect on 25 May next. The GDPR does not make specific provision for\u00a0Member States to give any further effect to\u00a0rules and standards applicable to\u00a0CCTV systems in their national laws. For this reason, Part 3 of the Data Protection Bill 2018, which gives further effect to the GDPR in certain areas, does not make any such provision.\u00a0The same applies to Part 5 of the Bill, which transposes the law enforcement Directive into national law. <\/p>  <p>  With regard data protection impact assessments, the position is that Article 35 of the GDPR provides for the carrying out of\u00a0impact assessments where processing of personal data is likely to result in a high risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals. It provides, in particular,\u00a0that such impact assessments must be carried out in cases of systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas. This GDPR obligation is directly applicable on controllers and processors concerned and there is no requirement\u00a0for national laws to give effect to it. However, paragraph 4 of Article 35 provides that the data protection authorities of the Member States shall prepare and publish a list of the kind of processing operations that are subject to the requirement for a data protection\u00a0impact assessment. <\/p>  <p>  Article 27 of the law enforcement Directive also makes provision for the carrying out of data protection impact assessments by competent authorities where a type of data processing, including the use of new technologies, is likely to result in a high risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals.  This obligation, which is not directly applicable, is given effect in section 81 of the Bill. Section 81(9) provides that the Data Protection Commission established under Part 2 of the Bill may, following consultation with the Minister, prescribe types of processing in respect of which impact assessments must be carried out.\u00a0Prior to making any such regulations, the Commission will be required to publish its draft proposals and to consider any submissions it receives in relation to them. <\/p>  <p>  I look forward to engaging in further discussions with The Deputy when the Data Protection Bill comes before the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700085#WRBB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Awards Scheme","counter":1419,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700085#WRBB04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1420,"qnumday":549,"qnumall":"[15822\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700085#WRBB04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if special consideration can be given to awarding a person (details supplied) with a national bravery award for their swift actions on 17 December 2017 at the Moy river in Ballina, County Mayo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1421,"content":"<p>The Deeds of Bravery Council (Comhairle na M&iacute;re Gaile) was convened under the Deeds of Bravery Act 1947 and makes awards to members of the public who have performed Acts of Bravery.

Year-on-year statistics to date indicate a continuation of the improvement recorded in 2017, with 3 fewer road traffic fatalities recorded by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the year to 16 April 2018 (a total of 46 fatalities) in comparison with the same period in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na benefitted from considerable resource investment by this Government in 2017, which has contributed to the most welcome downward trend in road traffic fatalities. The recruitment of an additional 150 Gardai to Roads Policing Units this year will contribute to a stronger road traffic enforcement capability nationwide. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also intend to have a stronger focus on road traffic enforcement in the training provided to new recruits at Templemore and this will have a positive impact on enforcement and, as a result, safety on our roads. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Road Safety Authority (RSA)\u00a0continue to seek and avail of new opportunities to communicate with all road users and it is evident, from last year's figures, that many road users are heeding road safety campaigns and are increasingly aware of the importance of responsible driving behaviour. <\/p>  <p>  The Road Safety Strategy sets an objective of reducing road deaths to no greater than 25 fatalities per million of population by end 2020. This equates to an average of 10.3 road deaths per month and 124 per year by end 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The RSA published its mid-term evaluation of the Road Safety Strategy earlier this year. The main purpose of the mid-term evaluation is to inform the programme of work for the remainder of the life of the Strategy in order that Ireland meets its road safety targets. Among the priorities for the final years of the Strategy is the\u00a0agreement of\u00a0a revised target on serious injuries resulting from road traffic collisions.\u00a0A provisional target of a 30% reduction was set at the start of the life of the Strategy, however the Strategy made a provision for Ireland to review the target , in line with the new reporting requirements set out by the European Commission to produce serious injury figures using a medical definition.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Ireland has, over a number of years, developed a multi-agency approach to road safety through the involvement of a number of agencies working in partnership, under the aegis of the Strategy. Progress in relation to the actions and outcomes set out in the Strategy are monitored on an ongoing basis by the RSA and the other agencies involved, and overseen by a Ministerial Committee on Road Safety. This Committee is scheduled to meet next on 2 May 2018. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme (2016-2021) sets out key strategic objectives for Road Policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Road Policing plans over the lifetime of the Programme.

At that time Parts 1 and 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 were commenced as necessary to get the new Authority appointed and underway. The Authority, which is independent in the performance of its functions under the 2015 Act, has convened regularly since its inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016 - minutes of its meetings are available on its website www.LSRA.ie. The challenge has been to ensure that the roll-out of the various components of the Authority's regulatory functions in a legally robust manner can be aligned, to the satisfaction of the Authority, with its anticipated working resources as an independent regulator.<\/p>  <p>  It will be recalled that, during its initial year of establishment, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has been deeply engaged in the conduct of public consultations and in the making of five reports on a series of new options for the provision of legal services under sections 118 to 120 of the Act which were also commenced. It had been obliged to complete these within strictly set deadlines running from its day of establishment on 1 October 2016. All of these reports have now been laid, as required under the 2015 Act, before the Houses of the Oireachtas while also being publicly accessible on the Authority&rsquo;s website. As reflected in the 2015 Act and the relevant reports completed by the Authority, the Government continues to give policy priority to the introduction of Legal Partnerships between barristers or barristers and solicitors by way of early structural reform in the way in which legal services are available to consumers. <\/p>  <p>  Alongside its other ongoing consultation and reporting commitments, the current working focus of the Authority is, I understand, very much on the managed roll-out of its remaining functions. This includes the matching development of the organisational capacities and office and staffing resources essential to effective delivery. It also includes the necessary preparatory steps for the establishment and application of the new Roll of Practicing Barristers under which both Law Library and non-Law Library practicing barristers will be regulated, for the first time under legislation, by the Authority. This will also be a pre-requisite for the exercise by the Authority of its public complaints functions. A further key area under development is that of the application of the levy that is to be made on both practicing solicitors and practicing barristers under Part 7 of the 2015 Act. Funding support of &euro;1 million has recently been provided to the Authority from the Justice Vote for 2017. This follows an advance of the same amount that was provided from my Department&rsquo;s 2016 Vote and a similar allocation is being made for 2018.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be recalled that in parallel to the introduction of enhanced legal costs transparency obligations on legal practitioners under the 2015 Act, extensive legal and technical preparations are also continuing separately within the courts system to complete the transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the Legal Costs Adjudicators. <\/p>  <p>  Following these steps, the key structural reforms of Part 6 of the 2015 Act relating to public complaints, professional conduct and the appointment of the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal dealing with both solicitors and barristers, will be commenced. It is considered that this component of the Act will underpin the entire new regulatory regime in terms of its observance and enforcement and by way of safeguarding the public interest. I will, of course, continue to emphasise the importance which I attach as Minister to the objective of getting the Authority open for business on the core public complaints function as quickly as is reasonably possible while also bearing in mind the risks and complexities which the Authority is having to carefully manage to bring that about. This work has been augmented by the appointment by the Authority last autumn of its first full-time Chief Executive, Dr. Brian Doherty, along with its securing of enhanced office accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The Regulatory Authority will soon be submitting its first full-year Annual Report having previously submitted a report for quarter three of 2016. It is actively preparing to conduct the first periodic review of the operation of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 as required under section 6 of that Act. Arrangements are also at an advanced stage to fill, with the necessary approval of each House of the Oireachtas, a casual vacancy that has arisen on the Authority due to the appointment of an existing member to the judiciary. Work is ongoing between the Authority and my Department on a new Corporate Governance Assurance Agreement. The Authority is also preparing to conduct statutory consultations and to report on the education and training arrangements in the State for legal practitioners. <\/p>  <p>  At this point, the Authority is nearing completion of the necessary analysis of the staffing needs and resources required to allow it to support the ongoing roll out of its functions to a structured and achievable timetable and intends to begin additional recruiting to key posts in the near future. Within the past week it has submitted its first Strategic Plan covering the period 2018&ndash;2020 as required under section 20 of the 2015 Act which I will be laying before the Houses in the coming days. The Plan sets out the Authority's key priorities and objectives for the next three years including indicative timelines for the coming into operation of its remaining functions. Both I and my Department will, therefore, continue to work closely with the Authority to enable it to come into substantive regulatory mode at the earliest opportunity including in the independent delivery of its strategic objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700086#WRCC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigrant Investor Programme Eligibility","counter":1447,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700086#WRCC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1448,"qnumday":558,"qnumall":"[16029\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700086#WRCC01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there are circumstances in which a non-national person legally living here under a time limited visa may be eligible to be considered under the immigrant investor programme provided all qualifying conditions are met; if it is the case the person cannot be here at the time of the application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1449,"content":"<p>The Immigrant Investor\u00a0Programme (IIP) provides the\u00a0non-EEA investor with the opportunity to invest in the State.

Unfortunately it is not possible to separate this data from the data in relation to the other persons in Mosney (approximately 600).\u00a0 Therefore the figure of 520 persons with status will include a number of\u00a0persons who arrived under the relocation programme, were accommodated in Mosney and have since been granted international protection.<\/p>  <p>  RIA, which administers the system of accommodation for protection applicants, has always provided such persons with continued accommodation while they source their own accommodation and while they get their affairs in order having been granted a leave to remain.\u00a0 RIA is particularly mindful of the reality of the housing situation in the State and the pressures on the City and County Councils in respect of Housing Assistance Payments and Housing Lists.\u00a0 That said, the provision of housing for persons coming out of the protection process has been incorporated in the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. <\/p>  <p>  Following on from the McMahon report, my Department developed a guide to independent living for persons with status to provide practical assistance for them.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>The Garda stations referred to form part\u00a0of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (D.M.R) West Division. I am informed by the Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute;\u00a0assigned to that Division\u00a0on 28 February 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available,\u00a0was 665 of whom 64 are designated as Community Garda.\u00a0There are also\u00a026\u00a0Garda Reserves and\u00a053 Garda civilian staff\u00a0attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. \u00a0<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including 155 to the D.M.R. West Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 200 of whom attested last month.\u00a0Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the D.M.R. West Division. <\/p><p>In relation to the number of &quot;Community Garda&iacute;\u00a0&quot; it is important to recognise that community policing is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official\u00a0categorisation as a &ldquo;Community\u00a0Garda&quot;\u00a0simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities including through the giving of talks to schools, community groups and others.\u00a0It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.<\/p><p>I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part\u00a0in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs. Overall the Model advocates\u00a0a partnership based, pro-active, community-orientated style of policing. It is focused on crime prevention, problem-solving and law enforcement, with a view to building trust and enhancing the quality of life of the entire community.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Kildare and Laois\/Offaly Divisions on 28 February 2018, the latest date for which information is currently available, was 357 and 340 respectively. There are also 20 Garda Reserves and 30 Garda civilian staff attached to the Kildare Division and 16 Garda Reserves and 25 Garda civilian staff attached to the Laois\/Offaly Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Unit, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.<\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including 85 and 76\u00a0to the Kildare and Laois\/Offaly Divisions respectively. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.<\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 200 of whom attested last month.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Kildare and Laois\/Offaly Divisions.<\/p><p>In relation to the number of &ldquo;Community Garda&iacute;&rdquo; it is important to recognise that community policing is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official\u00a0categorisation as a &ldquo;Community\u00a0Garda&quot;\u00a0simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities including through the giving of talks to schools, community groups and others.  It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.<\/p><p>I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part\u00a0in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs. Overall the Model advocates\u00a0a partnership based, pro-active, community-orientated style of policing. It is focused on crime prevention, problem-solving and law enforcement, with a view to building trust and enhancing the quality of life of the entire community. Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.<\/p><p>As part of the Community Policing Model An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work in partnership with local communities, to prevent and deter crime through initiatives such as Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert, Text Alert and the Garda Schools Programme as well as through more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees.<\/p><p>The Community Policing Model also places a strong emphasis on Crime Prevention and within each Garda Division, where\u00a0there are specialist Crime Prevention Officers (CPOs), who are trained to encourage, promote and advise on crime prevention within communities.<\/p><p>In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community\u00a0Engagement Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.<\/p><p>I have previously stated that I welcome the strong emphasis that the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places on\u00a0developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  In terms of progress on this important initiative, I am informed that a draft Community Policing Framework which outlines the manner in which Community Policing Teams will be established has been completed and is subject to internal review before being approved by the Garda Executive for implementation.<\/p><p>For the Deputy's information, I have provided in tabular form the total strength and Community Garda&iacute; strength of Garda Stations in the Kildare and Laois\/Offaly Divisions as of\u00a028 February 2018 the latest date for which figures are readily available, as provided by the Commissioner.<table><tr><th colspan=\"3\">COMMUNITY\u00a0GARDA \/STRENGTH KILDARE DIVISION 2018*<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Station<\/td><td>Total strength-each Garda has a role in community policing<\/td><td>No. who are\u00a0 exclusively engaged in Community\u00a0Garda&iacute;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ATHY<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CASTLEDERMOT<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILDARE<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MONASTEREVIN<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NEWBRIDGE<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>RATHANGAN<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CARBURY<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CELBRIDGE<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILCOCK<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LEIXLIP<\/td><td>60<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MAYNOOTH<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CLANE<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILCULLEN<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NAAS<\/td><td>115<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ROBERTSTOWN<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TOTAL<\/td><td>357<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><\/table>*As of 28 February 2018<table><tr><th colspan=\"3\">COMMUNITY GARDA \/STRENGTH LAOIS\/OFFALY DIVISION 2018*<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Station<\/td><td>Total strength- each Garda has a role in community policing<\/td><td>No. who are exclusively engaged in Community\u00a0Garda&iacute;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BANAGHER<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BIRR<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CLOGHAN<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>FERBANE<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILCORMAC<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KINNITTY<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SHINRONE<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ABBEYLEIX<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ARLES<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BALLYLINAN<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BORRIS-IN-OSSORY<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CLONASLEE<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DURROW<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MOUNTMELLICK<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MOUNTRATH<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>PORTALINGTON<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>PORTLAOISE<\/td><td>143<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>RATHDOWNEY<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>STRADBALLY<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CLARA<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DAINGEAN<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EDENDERRY<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>RHODE<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TULLAMORE<\/td><td>76<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TOTAL<\/td><td>340<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><\/table>*As of 28 February 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700087#WRDD03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Policy","counter":1520,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700087#WRDD04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1521,"qnumday":585,"qnumall":"[16668\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700087#WRDD04100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to outline the further steps that need to be taken for Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combatting violence against women and domestic violence; when Ireland will ratify it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1522,"content":"<p>I and my Government colleagues are totally committed to tackling violence against women and domestic violence.

On an annual basis, approximately 13.5 million vehicle registrations are read by the Automated Number Plate Recognition System, 1.9 million records are exchanged electronically with the Court Services, 9.3 million PULSE searches are conducted, 19.5 million TETRA digital radio calls are made and 118,000 fingerprints are searched.  The TETRA Radio system provides a modern digital encrypted radio system to all operational members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na allowing them to communicate securely.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that garda&iacute; must have the modern technology and resources necessary to detect and investigate crimes, and to prevent loss and harm to citizens and their property on a 24\/7 basis. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Garda Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016 - 2021 sets out a series of initiatives which will enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deploy the latest cutting-edge technologies in the fight against crime.  In support of this plan, some &euro;342 million, including &euro;217 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. <\/p>  <p>  In this context, a broad range of ICT projects are being delivered to support existing systems and develop them further, with the overall goal of supporting the ongoing business requirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in all fields, including the fight against organised crime activity.  <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Policing Plan sets out the organisation's priorities in tackling organised crime activity, together with its continued commitment to proactively target groups and individuals engaged in criminal activity, including organised criminal activities.   <\/p>  <p>  In tackling such activity, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement operations and strategies aimed at targeting, dismantling and disrupting criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies.  Multidisciplinary approaches are also employed to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted, including through the use of the Proceeds of Crime legislation, money-laundering legislation, the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 relating to organised crime and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau. <\/p>  <p>  At international level, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilises the available international mechanisms for police co-operation and training including CEPOL, Interpol, and Europol.  Garda Liaison Officers are based, on a full-time basis, in other EU Member States, including the Netherlands, France, United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal.  Garda Liaison Officers are also based at Europol. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to participate in joint and multidisciplinary and multi-jurisdictional investigations within the European Union and worldwide.  Successful investigations, prosecutions and disruptions of criminal activities have been and continue to be achieved through these parallel investigations.<\/p>  <p>  While we should not underestimate the difficulties which the Garda authorities face in tackling organised crime activity, we continue to see the significant results of their efforts in the arrests made and persons being brought before the Courts, as well as the ongoing drugs and firearms seizures made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700088#WREE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Data","counter":1543,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700088#WREE01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1544,"qnumday":593,"qnumall":"[16701\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700088#WREE01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of crimes committed by prisoners while on bail in each of the past ten years to date; the number in respect of which more than one crime was committed while still on bail; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1545,"content":"<p>The Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, is responsible for the compilation and publication of the official recorded crime statistics, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.\u00a0 I have asked the CSO to forward\u00a0any available statistics in this regard directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700088#WREE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Rehabilitation Programmes","counter":1546,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700088#WREE01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1547,"qnumday":594,"qnumall":"[16702\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700088#WREE01700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of prisoners who have not been given educational or rehabilitative training in any year in the past ten; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1548,"content":"<p>I wish to advise\u00a0the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service provides a wide range of\u00a0rehabilitative programmes to those in custody that include education,\u00a0vocational training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, counselling,\u00a0welfare and spiritual services.  These programmes can offer purposeful\u00a0activity to those in custody while serving their sentences and encouraging\u00a0them to lead law abiding lives on release.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are\u00a0eligible to use the services.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  On committal,\u00a0all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the\u00a0services available in the prison.  At\u00a0this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self-refer at a\u00a0later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a\u00a0prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.  The development\u00a0of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2016 - 2018.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning through\u00a0Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based\u00a0rehabilitative programmes.  As well as\u00a0seeking to draw on best practice in adult and further education in the\u00a0community, there has been a lot of curriculum development over the years that\u00a0is specific to prison circumstances, such as courses on addiction, health issues and offending behaviour. <\/p>  <p>  The Department\u00a0of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole-time teacher\u00a0equivalents to the Prison Service through the Education and Training Boards\u00a0(ETBs).  Education in prisons is delivered in partnership between the ETBs and\u00a0the Irish Prison Service with a focus on providing education which is quality\u00a0assured, student centred and which facilitates lifelong learning.  The\u00a0partnership endeavours to meet the needs of\u00a0prisoners through helping them\u00a0cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life\u00a0after release.  A broad and flexible curriculum is provided which ranges from\u00a0basic literacy classes and peer led tutoring to Open University.  There is an\u00a0increasing focus on QQI accreditation as the modular structure best meets the\u00a0needs of\u00a0individuals in prison.  On some\u00a0occasions, prisoners may have to wait for a place to become available on an\u00a0educational programme. <\/p>  <p>  Other areas\u00a0where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical\u00a0education, in the provision for higher education, in the arts and in\u00a0preparing prisoners for release and supporting their transition to life, and\u00a0often to education, on the outside.  A\u00a0top priority for the Irish Prison Service is ensuring help for those with\u00a0reading and writing problems and peer mentoring programmes are currently\u00a0active in all of our prisons.<\/p>  <p>  The guiding principles\u00a0which underpin the prisons' work and training service are to make available,\u00a0work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in\u00a0custody.  Training activities are\u00a0chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for\u00a0those in prison to acquire practical skills which will help them secure\u00a0employment on release.  Work Training\u00a0Officers have been appointed and assigned to areas such as catering, laundry,\u00a0industrial cleaning, industrial skills and gym.  The Irish Prison\u00a0Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and\u00a0opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years.  Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and\u00a0Guilds and the Guild of Cleaners and Launderers and the centralising of co-ordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled us to extend the\u00a0number of available courses and activities with certification. <\/p>  <p>  The manner in\u00a0which records are collated does not allow us to provide statistics re those who do not engage with educational or rehabilitative training in any year in the past ten. <\/p>  <p>  However, from\u00a0the records that are available I can inform the Deputy that 42.8% (1,626\u00a0persons) of the prisoner population\u00a0(3,797) participated in Education activities in week ending 2 February 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly 23% (799 persons) of the average prison population engaged in vocational training\u00a0in\u00a0the month of January 2018.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted\u00a0that a prisoner may participate in more than one activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700088#WREE01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Data","counter":1549,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700088#WREE01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1550,"qnumday":595,"qnumall":"[16703\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700088#WREE02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of criminal gang members serving prison sentences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1551,"content":"<p>I am advised by my officials in the Irish Prison Service that arising from a report compiled by them, there are currently 10 criminal groupings involving approximately 102 prisoners within the prison population excluding the subversive groupings in Portlaoise Prison and that the situation is subject to continuous monitoring and assessment. <\/p>  <p>  Membership or allegiance of these criminal groups fluctuates on a continuous basis with some persons breaking links and others becoming affiliated on a daily basis.  It is also the case that prisoners will not always declare their affiliation to certain groupings and it is therefore not possible to\u00a0provide definitive numbers in relation to the number of known members of criminal groupings currently in custody. <\/p>  <p>  The emergence in recent years of criminal groupings has had significant implications for the management of Irish Prisons.

Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.  Community policing is not, of course, confined to dedicated community garda&iacute;, all garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of progress on this important initiative, I am informed by the Commissioner that a draft Community Policing Framework which outlines the manner in which Community Policing Teams and Community Safety Fora will be established has been completed and is subject to internal review before being approved by the Executive for implementation.  The Commissioner anticipates that a number of Community Policing Teams will be established on a pilot basis this year.<\/p>  <p>  Tackling criminal gangs remains a priority for this Government and in addition to an allocation of almost &euro;100 million for Garda overtime to support anti-crime operations in 2018, the Government's Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 also provides for significant resourcing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

A quota of 610 permits has been applied to ensure that in the longer term the demand for chefs is met from a steady supply in the Irish labour market and to that end work is underway to increase the supply of chefs through training initiatives such as the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship and a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a number of employments in animation were added to the highly skilled list.

I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.\u00a0 The proposals seek to ensure that: <\/p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;<\/p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;<\/p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and<\/p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  It is hoped to bring a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government shortly, seeking Government approval to the drafting of the Bill for the new Transport Support Payment.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment.  The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020.\u00a0 Following closure of the scheme in February 2013,\u00a0 no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.\u00a0 Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700090#WRGG03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":1660,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700090#WRGG03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1661,"qnumday":636,"qnumall":"[14944\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700090#WRGG03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of psychotherapists employed on full-time permanent contracts by the HSE nationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1662,"qnumday":637,"qnumall":"[14945\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700090#WRGG03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the numbers of psychotherapists employed by the HSE on rolling or yearly contracts nationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1663,"qnumday":638,"qnumall":"[14946\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700090#WRGG03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to create full-time permanent positions for the psychotherapists employed on rolling or yearly contracts; the locations in which these positions will be offered by county in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p>  <p>  The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanism by the NTPF, with a view to:<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;<\/p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A Steering Committee has been established to oversee this review which is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

The most recent update from the NTPF is that the report will be finalised and ready for review in the first half of 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to variations in the cost of care for public and private nursing homes it is acknowledged that public nursing homes have, in general, a higher cost of care.\u00a0 It is understood that a number of factors contribute to this such as higher dependency levels of clients requiring a higher staff skill mix, environmental implications for staffing levels and the geographical provision of residential placements.<\/p>  <p>  That said, there is a need to undertake a deeper analysis of the factors driving the higher costs of care in public units.  This is why the 2015 Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme also identified the need for a Value for Money and Policy (VFM) review of the cost differentials in public and private\/voluntary residential facilities.

My Department will continue to monitor the emerging research on all products, so as to inform decisions around any future additional regulation in this area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700091#WRHH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff Data","counter":1701,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700091#WRHH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1702,"qnumday":651,"qnumall":"[15006\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700091#WRHH03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of orthopaedic procedures in the public system that were carried out by a consultant orthopaedic surgeon and their team (details supplied) at University College Hospital, Galway;

Every effort has been made to protect the budgets of Drug and Alcohol Task Forces in recent years.\u00a0In excess of &euro;27.6m has been allocated to Task Forces by the HSE and the Department of Health for community-based drugs initiatives this year. This level of funding is consistent with the amounts provided for the last four years.<\/p><p>The budget allocation for the twenty four Local and Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces from the Drugs Initiative of the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive for 2010 to 2018 is set out in the table hereunder. Details of the allocations for Drug and Alcohol Task Forces before 2010 are not readily available.<\/p><p>Arising from a request from the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy\u00a0a review of Task Forces was\u00a0 completed in 2012. One of the main changes recommended by the review was that Drug Task Forces be renamed Drug and Alcohol Task Forces and given a role in relation to tackling alcohol.<\/p><p>In light of their expanded role, a substance misuse measure was included in the Dormant Accounts Action Plan 2014 and the Task Forces were identified as the key structures through which the measure would be implemented.<\/p><p>In excess of &euro;930,000 in additional funding was recommended for disbursement to Drug and Alcohol Task Forces from the Dormant Accounts Fund for substance misuse initiatives. The grants to Task Forces were provided from the Dormant Accounts Fund on a once-off basis to undertake a range of coordinated activities aimed at raising awareness of drug and alcohol-related harm in local communities in line with the National Drugs Strategy. <\/p><p>The Community Action on Alcohol Pilot Project was developed in 2014 to provide Task Forces with training on community mobilisation in order to develop coordinated strategies to change behaviour around alcohol and raise awareness of alcohol related harm. In addition, a number of Task Forces have benefitted from training provided by the Alcohol Forum for the development of local alcohol action plans.<\/p><p>I strongly believe that resources should be directed towards interventions that\u00a0are most effective in reducing problem substance use. Measuring\u00a0the effectiveness of responses to the drug problem is therefore an important objective of public policy. Towards this end, my Department will develop a performance measurement system by 2020 which will improve accountability across all sectors, including the task forces.\u00a0<\/p><p>I intend\u00a0meeting with the Chairs of\u00a0 the twenty four Local and Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces\u00a0shortly to discuss the implementation of\u00a0 the national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, including initiatives to strengthen the capacity of task forces to support the implementation of\u00a0the strategy.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>LDATF<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014 DOH<\/th><th>2014

It is generally accepted that there is a need to modernise the current GMS contract and ensure that general practice is a viable and rewarding career for medical graduates. My aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions. A new contract must be flexible and be able to respond to the changing nature of the GP workforce. It must also include provisions in relation to service quality and standards, performance, accountability and transparency. <\/p>  <p>  It is essential that engagement on GP contractual issues is aimed squarely at meeting the substantial challenges, current and future, the health service and general practice face.\u00a0The latest phase of\u00a0engagement with GP representatives commenced in January 2017, and\u00a0discussions were progressed on a\u00a0wide range of items throughout 2017.

Improvements are also planned for out-of-hours liaison, seven-day response services, and progressing the CAMHS Day Hospital service.<\/p>  <p>  A key initiative to improve counselling services at Primary Care level has been the recent approval by Government for the appointment of 114 Assistant Psychologists and 20 Psychologists to assist young people.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.<\/p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for the localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the only licensed use for the patch in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.<\/p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where, in Ireland, more plasters were being used in than the entire UK National Health Service.  In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.<\/p>  <p>  Following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches from September 2017, to support appropriate use and patient care.  Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant must apply to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient.  In the case of a negative reimbursement decision, the treating clinician can appeal the decision.  Once a patient is approved for reimbursement support, irrespective of the indication, there will be no expiry on the duration of treatment.  This also applies to applications already approved by the MMP.<\/p>  <p>  As of 29 March 2018, there have been 5,747 online applications from clinicians requesting the reimbursement of Versatis.  Of these applications, 1,205 patients (over 21%) have been approved.  Of 672 online appeals, over 71% of patients have been approved for reimbursement.  The MMP has sought further information on another 41 appeals.

The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p>  <p>  The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanism by the NTPF, with a view to:<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;<\/p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.<\/p>  <p>  A Steering Committee has been established to oversee this review which is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

This is why the 2015 Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme identified the need for a Value for Money and Policy (VFM) review of the cost differentials in public and private \/ voluntary residential facilities.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p>  <p>  The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanism by the NTPF, with a view to:<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;<\/p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.<\/p>  <p>  A Steering Committee has been established to oversee this review which is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The NTPF has responsibility for the development of this report, although Department Officials continue to engage with the NTPF regarding the review.

However I welcome the work to date and look forward to the NTPF concluding the review later this year.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to variations in the cost of care for public and private nursing homes it is acknowledged that public nursing homes have, in general, a higher cost of care.\u00a0 It is understood that a number of factors contribute to this, such as higher dependency levels of clients requiring a higher staff skill mix, environmental implications for staffing levels and the geographical provision of residential placements.  That said, there is a need to undertake a deeper analysis of the factors driving the higher costs of care in public units.  This is why the 2015 Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme identified the need for a Value for Money and Policy (VFM) review of the cost differentials in public and private\/voluntary residential facilities.\u00a0 My Department will be working on this VFM throughout the year.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700098#WRPP01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1996,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700098#WRPP01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1997,"qnumday":762,"qnumall":"[15462\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700098#WRPP01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the consultation process being conducted by his Department in respect of the delivery of clinical services at the Midlands Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, will commence; the person chairing this process; when meetings with local clinicians and the community will take place; the timeline for the conclusion of this process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1998,"content":"<p>It remains the case, as outlined at my meeting with you and the other Laois Oireachtas members in December 2017, that no decision has been made yet on the draft Action Plan for Portlaoise Hospital.

It should be noted that as of 1 March there were only 23 GMS panels that do not have a permanent GP in place &ndash; a vacancy rate of less than 1%. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.  Efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible\/shared GMS\/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has also taken steps to expand GP training.  In 2009, there were 120 GP training places.  This year there are over 190 GP training places available for the 2018 GP training intake.  The Government is committed to further increasing this number to 259 places annually in future years. <\/p>  <p>  It is generally accepted that there is a need to modernise the current GMS contract and ensure that general practice benefits patients while providing for a viable and rewarding career for current and future GPs.  The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions. <\/p>  <p>  Engagement with GP representatives on contractual issues will commence in the coming weeks.

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.<\/p>  <p>  The 2013 Act does not give the Minister for Health any powers in this regard.  The HSE does not require approval or consent from the Minister or Government when making a reimbursement decision.<\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).<\/p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an ongoing basis.

Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.\u00a0 The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs. The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring\/Summer session 2018. I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.\u00a0The proposals seek to ensure that: <\/p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;<\/p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;<\/p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and<\/p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  It is hoped to bring a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government shortly, seeking Government approval to the drafting of the Bill for the new Transport Support Payment.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment. The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020.\u00a0 Following closure of the scheme in February 2013,\u00a0 no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.\u00a0 Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700106#WRXX02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":2403,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700106#WRXX02600"},{"type":"question","counter":2404,"qnumday":902,"qnumall":"[16015\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700106#WRXX02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a hospital appointment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2405,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The HSE Policy in respect of all Consultant Appointments, both permanent and temporary is a requirement that they are on the Specialist Register. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE issued instructions to all managers in July 2017 in relation to the management of those in posts who are not on the Specialist Register. These include putting in place a risk mitigation plan where the appointee does not hold the specified qualifications. This can include appropriate senior clinical oversight, if required.  Consultants appointed prior to 2008 who do not hold specialist registration are to be supported in achieving registration.  <\/p>  <p>  Employers have also been asked to ensure that the contracts of temporary or locum doctors who do not hold the qualifications required for the post they occupy be ended and employment terminated.  There are limited circumstances where, an experienced doctor, usually a Senior Registrar, who would not be on the Specialist Register may cover for an absent Consultant. This is in order to ensure senior medical coverage and to ensure the provision of safe quality care.  The HSE has stated that this only occurs as a final option, in emergency circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  Any doctor who occupies a consultant post, even if he\/she is not on the specialist register would still hold a medical licence and would be on a division of the Medical Council Register.

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard laboratory approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and has been agreed by experts from the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and other Irish and international experts.  This testing is available in Ireland.<\/p><p>Laboratories in Ireland generally follow the laboratory testing recommendations of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Disease Society of America, the European Federation of Neurological Societies, and the British Infection Association.  Irish laboratories have their own quality assurance methods to make sure the tests are working correctly as well as being accredited by the Irish National Accreditation Body to perform the test correctly.In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory.  This laboratory uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities which involves a screening test followed by a confirmatory test.<\/p><p>Testing which is performed abroad may be performed in laboratories which have not met National or International Accreditation (Quality Standards).  These tests may be more likely to give a &ldquo;false positive&rdquo; result. <\/p><p>Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics by General Practitioners.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.<\/p><p>The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre website (<i>www.hpsc.ie<\/i>) gives extensive information on Lyme disease diagnosis, treatment and how to avoid tick bites.  A Lyme Disease Subcommittee of the Scientific Advisory Committee of HPSC with professional clinical, entomological, scientific and environmental health expert representation (including a representative of the Lyme Support Group, Tick-Talk Ireland) has been established to explore all possible ways of raising awareness about Lyme disease.  This Subcommittee is expected to meet shortly with a view to finalising it report.  This report will cover a number of areas, including initiatives undertaken to date, summary advice relating to awareness, preventive advice for the general public, preventive advice and material for those responsible for sites or locations known to have or suspected as having higher densities of ticks, and summary advice relating to GP management of the condition.  Any person who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700111#WRCCC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Availability","counter":2634,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700111#WRCCC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2635,"qnumday":982,"qnumall":"[16504\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700111#WRCCC01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the drug Ocrelizumeb will be approved for MS sufferers here (details supplied).

The HSE is finalising the report setting out progress on implementation of the Agreement as at end December 2017.  Indications are that there has been significant growth in the appointment of nurses and midwives in the final months of the year with 942 WTE of the 1,224 posts filled (including student nurses) or 69% (847 WTE) excluding the student nurses.  The HSE remain committed to the Agreement and efforts will continue to fill the remaining posts.<\/p>  <p>  The measures put in place by the HSE to recruit nurses and midwives included two international recruitment campaigns in 2017 the \"Bring Them Home\" campaign and the \"New Year New Career\".  Nurses who relocate to work in the Irish public health service can receive up to &euro;3,000 in relocation expenses.

It operates under a licence from the Minister of Culture, Heritage &amp;amp; the Gaeltacht, issued annually with a total of 26 conditions. These include a variety of measures, including a requirement that a qualified veterinarian attends at all coursing meetings to report on the health of the hares, a prohibition on the coursing of hares more than once in the same day, a prohibition on the coursing of sick or pregnant hares and a requirement that hares be released back into the wild during daylight hours.<\/p>  <p>  The ICC\u00a0undertakes a range of actions to address issues related to health and welfare. Coursing clubs are required to comply fully with directives, instructions and guidance notes issued by the ICC in all matters relating to the capture, keeping in captivity, tagging, marking, coursing and release of hares, and the muzzling of greyhounds.<\/p>  <p>  A monitoring committee on coursing is in place, comprising officials from my Department, the ICC and the National Parks and Wildlife Services (NPWS), to monitor developments in coursing and in that regard the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interests of both hares and greyhounds.<\/p>  <p>  The committee meets after each coursing season to review the outcome of all\u00a0coursing meetings, having\u00a0particular regard to hare and greyhound welfare. \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I believe that it is critically important that those involved in coursing operate in accordance with the regulatory framework and that the welfare of both hares and greyhounds is at the forefront at all times.

The programme identifies a number of methods for supporting the sector, such as ensuring smaller inshore boats are given new opportunities for commercial fishing. Support is being provided under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme (EMFF OP) for enhanced management and conservation of inshore stocks, including v-notching of lobster, more selective fishing gear and preparation and implementation of management plans for a sustainable inshore fishery. Funding of some &euro;6 million has been earmarked under the programme for the Inshore Fisheries Conservation Scheme.<\/p><p>I meet regularly with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF). The NIFF and its supporting network of six Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums (RIFFs) cover the entire coast. The Inshore Forums provide a platform for the discussion of problems facing the inshore sea-fisheries sector and have been making recommendation to me on issues of concern for their sector.<\/p><p>The NIFF is taking the lead in setting priorities for the inshore sector, including developing for the first time a dedicated strategy. From my meetings with the NIFF, I have introduced a number of industry-led initiatives, developed through the forum structures, following extensive consultation.  These include conservation measures for inshore stocks such as velvet crab and scallop off the coast of Wexford.  Public consultations were also held earlier this year (2018) on proposed management measures recommended to me by the NIFF in respect of brown crab and razor clam in the North Irish Sea. <\/p><p>The issue of limiting access to different categories of vessels in inshore waters and within 6 nautical miles has been raised by a number of stakeholders. My department is currently in the final stages of preparing a formal paper to include possible measures. I hope to be in a position to present this paper for a full public consultation in the coming weeks. <\/p><p>The potential impact of limiting access to different categories of vessels in inshore waters and within 6 nautical miles has been the subject of scientific and economic reports by the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara. There has also been preliminary engagement with fisheries representative groups in respect of these reports. The forthcoming consultation paper will set out possible measures and their potential impacts.<\/p><p>Let me reassure the Deputy that once the public consultation begins, adequate time will be provided to ensure that the diverse interests of all stakeholders are considered and any possible measures will be fair and balanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700116#WRHHH00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Payments","counter":2883,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700116#WRHHH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2884,"qnumday":1071,"qnumall":"[15467\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700116#WRHHH01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if farm payments for persons (details supplied) will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2885,"content":"<p>All GLAS payments in this case are\u00a0fully up to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700116#WRHHH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Assist Scheme Payments","counter":2886,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700116#WRHHH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2887,"qnumday":1072,"qnumall":"[15608\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700116#WRHHH01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a farm income supplement payment for a person (details supplied) for February 2018 will be reinstated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2888,"content":"<p>The movement of any animal into a restricted holding is prohibited, except with written permission of the RVO and following a movement permit.

In this regard my Department has paid out over &euro;1.6bn to Irish farmers under Pillar I and Pillar II and will continue to make residual payments. <\/p><p>As a further early intervention, and to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the issue of fodder availability in affected areas, I convened a fodder group chaired by Teagasc, and comprising of all the main stakeholders including feed merchants and co-ops, banking, farm bodies etc.  <\/p><p>I introduced a targeted &lsquo;<i>Fodder Transport Support measure&rsquo;<\/i>on 29<sup>th<\/sup>January 2018 to provide additional assistance to those livestock farmers in parts of the West and North West severely affected by on-going fodder shortages. The main purpose of the measure was to support the cost of transporting fodder between those areas where it was plentiful and those where it was scarce. It is operated primarily through the Co-operative structure. <\/p><p>The continuation of cold wet weather throughout March resulted in a serious delay to the onset of spring. Grass growth remained negligible, ground stayed wet and livestock had to remain housed in many cases. This resulted in the fodder problem extending countrywide with a consequent tightening of fodder availability nationally. <\/p><p>In response I extended the fodder transport measure to all counties and also introduced a Fodder Import Support Measure, to ensure that there was adequate fodder available to feed the national herd. This measure was introduced on 5<sup>th<\/sup>April to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage (hay, silage, haylage etc.) from outside the island of Ireland. Northern Ireland is excluded. The measure is operated through Co-operatives and other importers approved by the Department. It covers forage imported up to 30th April 2018.  Support under the measure will substantially reduce the cost to farmers of imported fodder by approximately one third. This initial allocation will support the importation of up to 20,000 tons of fodder into the country and this will be kept under on-going review until the current crisis is over.

In this regard my Department has paid out over &euro;1.6bn to Irish farmers under Pillar I and Pillar II and will continue to make residual payments. <\/p><p>As a further early intervention, and to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the issue of fodder availability in affected areas, I convened a fodder group chaired by Teagasc, and comprising of all the main stakeholders including feed merchants and co-ops, banking, farm bodies etc.  <\/p><p>I introduced a targeted &lsquo;<i>Fodder Transport Support measure&rsquo;<\/i>on 29<sup>th<\/sup>January 2018 to provide additional assistance to those livestock farmers in parts of the West and North West severely affected by on-going fodder shortages. The main purpose of the measure was to support the cost of transporting fodder between those areas where it was plentiful and those where it was scarce. It is operated primarily through the Co-operative structure. <\/p><p>The continuation of cold wet weather throughout March resulted in a serious delay to the onset of spring. Grass growth remained negligible, ground stayed wet and livestock had to remain housed in many cases. This resulted in the fodder problem extending countrywide with a consequent tightening of fodder availability nationally. <\/p><p>In response I extended the fodder transport measure to all counties, reduced the minimum distance to 50 km and also introduced a Fodder Import Support Measure, to ensure that there was adequate fodder available to feed the national herd. This measure was introduced on 5<sup>th<\/sup>April to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage (hay, silage, haylage etc.) from outside the island of Ireland. Northern Ireland is excluded. The measure is operated through Co-operatives and other importers approved by the Department. It covers forage imported up to 30th April 2018.  Support under the measure will substantially reduce the cost to farmers of imported fodder by approximately one third. This initial allocation will support the importation of up to 20,000 tons of fodder into the country and this will be kept under on-going review until the current crisis is over.<\/p><p>In other supports, planning continues with a view to commencement of balancing payments under certain Pillar II schemes including the Sheep Welfare Scheme followed by the GLAS scheme.<\/p><p>The GLAS Traditional Hay Meadow grazing date has already been extended to 1 May 2018, and this makes available an additional 27,000 ha of grazing for livestock which would not otherwise be available.<\/p><p>Furthermore, I am presently engaging in a series of meetings with the CEO's of the main banks to discuss any cash flow issues arising from the recent bad weather and access to finance for the sector generally.

In a border context, and in terms of mitigating the impact in counties Monaghan and Cavan, the UK commitment in the Joint EU-UK Report of last December to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland was extremely important.  At the Government insistence this commitment is now being translated into legal form in the draft of the Withdrawal Agreement, and we are currently working closely with our EU counterparts and the European Commission Task Force to achieve progress in the actions necessary to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  During my recent visit to London on St Patrick&rsquo;s week I met with my UK counterpart, Secretary of State Michael Gove and stressed the importance of avoiding a hard border on the island in order to facilitate bilateral trade post Brexit, without undermining the Single Market. <\/p>  <p>  Since the Brexit vote, the Government has introduced a range of measures to help the agri-food sector navigate the short-term impacts.  In Budget 2017, I introduced measures to help reduce farm gate business costs, including a &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme, new agri-taxation measures and increased funding under the Rural Development and Seafood Development Programmes. <\/p>  <p>  In 2018 Budget I announced a &euro;50m Brexit support package, which will comprise a number of initiatives.  Firstly, in cooperation with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I have recently announced a new Brexit Loan Scheme aimed at providing affordable, flexible financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future, at least 40% of which will be available to food businesses.  <\/p>  <p>  I am also considering the development of a separate loan scheme similar to the 2017 low-cost scheme, based on &euro;25m funding from my Department to the Scheme.  These measures are aimed at enhancing competitiveness within the sector.<\/p>  <p>  I have also introduced supports for Bord Bia for investment in market insight and market prioritisation initiatives, which are aimed at identifying and developing potential diversification opportunities.  I had already increased funding to Bord Bia by &euro;10 million since the Brexit vote, and a further &euro;4.5 million is allocated in Budget 2018.  Following on from the successful trade mission to the USA and Canada in February of this year I will, as part of the marketing effort, lead further trade missions in 2018 to promote Irish food and drink in key markets.  I will lead a trade mission to China and Hong Kong next month to develop our relationship further, which takes on additional importance now that we have succeeded in opening this market to beef exports from Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  To enhance product diversification, I have also allocated funding to support the development of the new National Food Innovation Hub, which will be located in the Teagasc Moorepark complex. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government remains very focused on supporting farmers and the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead, whether they are based in Cavan, Monaghan or any other part of the country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700120#WRMMM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Sector","counter":3096,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700120#WRMMM02300"},{"type":"question","counter":3097,"qnumday":1143,"qnumall":"[16768\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700120#WRMMM02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding the percentage of lands in counties Cavan and Monaghan and the entire country used for a purpose (details supplied); the way in which this is monitored; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3098,"content":"<p>According to the\u00a0National Forest Inventory (NFI) 2012 total forest cover in Counties Cavan and Monaghan\u00a0\u00a0is 8.7% and 4.3% respectively\u00a0 - information is\u00a0set out in\u00a0the table below.<\/p><p>National Forest Inventory<table><tr><th>Cavan<\/th><th>16,830 ha.s<\/th><th>8.7%<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>5,598 ha.s<\/td><td>4.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total for Country\u00a0<\/td><td>731,652 ha.s<\/td><td>10.5%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The National Forest Inventory (NFI) is the principal means of monitoring national forest cover in Ireland.

It is operated primarily through the Co-operative structure. <\/p><p>The continuation of cold wet weather throughout March resulted in a serious delay to the onset of spring.  Grass growth remained negligible, ground stayed wet and livestock had to remain housed in many cases.  This resulted in the fodder problem extending countrywide with a consequent tightening of fodder availability nationally. <\/p><p>In response I extended the fodder transport measure to all counties and also introduced a Fodder Import Support Measure, to ensure that there was adequate fodder available to feed the national herd.  This measure was introduced on 5<sup>th<\/sup>April to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage (hay, silage, haylage etc.) from outside the island of Ireland.  Northern Ireland is excluded.  The measure is operated through Co-operatives and other importers approved by the Department.  It covers forage imported up to 30th April 2018.\u00a0 Support under the measure will substantially reduce the cost to farmers of imported fodder by approximately one third.

IFI manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis as each of Ireland&rsquo;s 147 salmon rivers (including river sections and estuaries) has its own genetically unique stock of salmon.<\/p>  <p>  IFI is supported in its management role by the independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC), comprising scientists from a range of organisations.  Scientific and management assessments of each of the distinct stocks are carried out every year with IFI engaged in extensive stock monitoring which feeds into the SSC's annual reviews. The SSC uses catch returns to individual rivers (rod catch, catch and release and any commercial catch) over the previous five years to estimate the total salmon returns in each of the previous five years.  The use of a five year average ensures that a good or bad year does not have a disproportionate impact on the stock assessment in any single year.<\/p>  <p>  Each river has an individual conservation limit which is the number of adult salmon required to maintain a healthy population.  Rivers which sufficiently exceed their conservation limit may be opened for harvest fisheries (recreational and\/or commercial). Rivers which meet 50% of their conservation limit may be opened for catch and release (C&amp;R) angling which permits enjoyment of angling while having a negligible impact of vulnerable fish stocks and encouraging the shared responsibility to contribute to conservation and the potential rebuilding of these stocks.  For 2018, 78 rivers in Ireland were open to harvest or catch and release fishing. <\/p>  <p>  The decline in wild Atlantic Salmon is an international issue manifesting in rivers in all countries around the North Atlantic with scientific analysis from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) estimating that marine survival of migrating salmon has been at or below 5% in the North Atlantic for more than a decade. <\/p>  <p>  Marine survival is considered to have the biggest influence on return, from far North Atlantic feeding grounds, of salmon to all rivers on Atlantic coasts.  Climate change in the ocean is considered to be a major factor.  There is also evidence that heavy sea-lice infestation from salmon farming has resulted in additional mortality in respect of migratory North Atlantic salmon generally.  In freshwater, water quality and a range of pressures such as afforestation, drainage, effluent discharge, siltation and agricultural enrichment can all have an impact on juvenile salmon production.<\/p>  <p>  The protection and conservation of salmon internationally is managed through the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) with which Ireland is aligned through the European Union. Concerted international co-operation has ensured that restrictions in Greenland and Faroese waters have been in place for a number of years via NASCO agreement. In June this year my officials and those of IFI will join delegates from the EU, USA, Canada, Norway, the Russian Federation, Greenland and the Faroes in seeking to negotiate a continuation of restrictions in these waters. <\/p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to Greenlandic waters, the majority component of the stock complex migrating to these waters originates from the North American Continent.  The is no commercial harvest in Faroese waters where the migratory stock complex comprises a majority component of European river stocks including those from Ireland.   <\/p>  <p>  The Atlantic salmon is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive with which Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime complies. In order to align fully with the Directive and the North NASCO principles, Ireland closed mixed stock fisheries at sea since 2007.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700121#WRNNN00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1314"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Projects","counter":3126,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700121#WRNNN00600"},{"type":"question","counter":3127,"qnumday":1154,"qnumall":"[15002\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700121#WRNNN00700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his views on the entitlement to compensation of residents affected by a development in view of reports (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":3128,"qnumday":1155,"qnumall":"[15017\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700121#WRNNN00800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his views on the entitlement to compensation of residents affected by developments (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":3129,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1154 and 1155 together.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to developing Ireland's energy sector, the Programme for Government seeks a better balance between the concerns of local communities and the need to invest in indigenous energy projects and my Department is currently finalising the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme which is being designed to assist in Ireland meeting its renewable energy contribution to EU wide targets out to 2030.

This means that the cost-benefit for the connection needs to be positive i.e. the expected revenues over a period of time must exceed the projected costs for the project to be viable. The Connections Policy appraises both domestic and industrial\/commercial demand, and so proximity to a major pipeline and a large industrial\/commercial gas load tend to be the most significant factors in town appraisals. <\/p>  <p>  I am further informed that the last assessment of this region concluded that it is not economically viable to connect Dungarvan.

While at this point no final decisions have been made as regards which technologies will be supported, I welcome and have noted with interest the falling costs of renewable technologies over the past year, such as offshore wind and solar PV.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In addition, Ireland's renewable\u00a0energy\u00a0portfolio\u00a0post-2020 will have regard to our obligations and member state contribution that may be agreed as part of an EU-wide renewables\u00a0target under the new Renewable Energy Directive, that is currently being negotiated under the Clean Energy Package. <\/p><p>Details in relation to\u00a0electricity system demand and fuel mix are publicly available on the EirGrid website at <i>. <\/i><\/p><p>The following table provides\u00a0a breakdown of\u00a02016 generation\u00a0for all\u00a0technologies on a percentage basis.\u00a0\u00a0<table><tr><th>Generation Technology<\/th><th>Proportions of electricity generated (%) (2016)\u00a0<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Oil<\/td><td>1.0%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Peat<\/td><td>7.7%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Coal<\/td><td>15.6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Natural Gas<\/td><td>50.6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wind <br \/><br \/>(normalised)<\/td><td>20.4%<br \/><br \/>(22.3%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Hydro(normalised)<\/td><td>2.3%<br \/><br \/>(2.5%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Other Renewables &amp;amp; Wastes<\/td><td>2.5%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>100%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700122#WROOO02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":3195,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700122#WROOO03000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge","counter":3194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700122#WROOO02900"},{"type":"question","counter":3195,"qnumday":1179,"qnumall":"[15795\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700122#WROOO03000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"c&eacute; na c&eacute;imeanna at&aacute; glactha aige lena chinnti&uacute; go mbeidh Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute; ar f&aacute;il d&rsquo;aos &oacute;g ioml&aacute;n na t&iacute;re ar a chuid tonnta f&eacute;in chomh maith le bheith ar f&aacute;il ar an idirl&iacute;on chun go gcomhl&iacute;onfar an gealltanas sa Strait&eacute;is Fiche Bliain don Ghaeilge maidir le st&aacute;isi&uacute;n raidi&oacute; Gaeilge d&aacute; gcuid f&eacute;in a bheith ag aos &oacute;g na t&iacute;re","asker":"1312","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":3196,"content":"<p>In 2017, bhuail m&eacute; leis an lucht bainist&iacute;ochta sa st&aacute;isi&uacute;n Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute; agus sheol m&eacute; an aip nua don st&aacute;isi&uacute;n, uirlis a thugann deis do dhaoine ar fud an domhain &eacute;isteacht lena gcuid cl&aacute;r.

Ireland&rsquo;s core transport network, which is a subset of our comprehensive network, is required to be completed by 2030 and was identified on the basis of this planning methodology, which identified the most important urban nodes, ports and airports.  These nodes are connected on the TEN-T maps via multimodal transport links.  The technical specifications of the Comprehensive Network are also required to be completed by 2050.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Against the backdrop of a very difficult economic climate in 2011, Ireland was required to consider the specific implications of the proposed network for Ireland&rsquo;s transport infrastructure, as well as our financial capacity to complete the technical specifications of our portion of the network within the timeframes proposed.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Inclusion of transport routes on TEN-T could potentially allow projects on those routes to be part-funded by the EU.  However, this could only be done through competitive EU-wide processes which were expected to be considerably over-subscribed.  The majority of costs of any capital project being funded by the Exchequer would still be borne by the Exchequer, with just the potential, if applications were successful, of a minority of grant funding coming from EU sources.  All projects would also require accompanying cost-benefit analyses.<\/p><p>It was in this context that Ireland, as with other Member States, liaised with the European Commission regarding its views on the appropriateness of the draft Network in line with the proposed methodology and with the affordability of completion of the network at that time.  This resulted in sections of the proposed network not ultimately being included in the final TEN-T maps agreed in 2013. <\/p><p>Irish projects have to date been successful in obtaining funding under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) mechanism and details of these projects are available online, at the following link: . <\/p><p>Despite the economic challenges the country has faced, a priority has been placed on access to and within the North-West.

Project Ireland 2040 places a strong emphasis on further improving connectivity, including the development of the strategic Cork to Limerick road link.<\/p><p>There will be a review of the implementation of the core network by end 2023. The Commission will consult with Member States and will evaluate progress made in the implementation of the TEN-T Regulation, as well as the impact of evolving traffic patterns and relevant developments in infrastructure investment plans. The Regulation further sets out that the Commission, in consultation with EU Member States, will evaluate whether the core network should be modified to take into account developments in transport flows and national investment planning. In the meantime, the recently published Project 2040 by Government includes a range of potential transport projects, including key transport projects in the West and Northwest regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700124#WRQQQ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport Data","counter":3279,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700124#WRQQQ02100"},{"type":"question","counter":3280,"qnumday":1209,"qnumall":"[14995\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700124#WRQQQ02200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of times delays occurred on the Luas due to medical emergencies in each of the years 2014 to 2017 and to date in 2018, by month and Luas line in tabular form.","asker":"1333","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":3281,"content":"<p>The issue raised is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA), in conjunction with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) and the Luas operator, Transdev.

Due to numerous competing demands, the availability of kerbside space for coach parking is extremely limited in Dublin City Centre.\u00a0 This has given rise to issues where tour coaches have difficulties in dropping passengers and collecting them subsequently at the same location. \u00a0Contributing to this issue are coaches who park at the designated on-street coach parking spaces for lengthy periods, precluding the use of those spaces for drop-off and collection.\u00a0 Notable among the streets affected is Nassau Street which, despite having a considerable number of coach spaces, suffers from coaches occupying those spaces for several hours at a time.<\/p>  <p>  To address the issue of multi-hour on-street coach parking during business hours, the NTA decided to develop a coach parking facility where coaches could lay-over during daytime hours, thereby freeing up the available on-street spaces.\u00a0 In order for such a coach park to meet its objective, it had to be located\u00a0close to the city centre, to ensure short journeys from the passenger locations and to\u00a0be\u00a0useful for short-stay coaches.  Planning permission was granted for a coach space facility in North Wall from Dublin City Council in 2015, was subsequently appealed and a\u00a0grant of permission with a number of conditions was issued by An Bord Pleanala in May 2016.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Discussions were held by the NTA with the Coach Tourism Transport Council (CTTC) in advance of the construction contract for the facility so as to ensure that the coach park would be used by their members, where feasible, during its hours of operation.\u00a0 A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed by both the NTA and the CTTC in January 2017, which set out the operational hours of the coach park, the charges that will apply for parking in the facility, and the commitment of CTTC to encourage use of the facility by their members. <\/p>  <p>  In light of their responsibility in this matter,\u00a0I have referred the Deputy's question to the National Transport Authority for a direct\u00a0response.\u00a0 Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700125#WRRRR01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Airport Development Projects","counter":3320,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700125#WRRRR02000"},{"type":"question","counter":3321,"qnumday":1226,"qnumall":"[15304\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700125#WRRRR02100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 538 of 27 March 2018, the legal basis upon which the DAA is permitted to withhold public information from residents, namely, the longitudinal data which have long been outstanding that are being withheld on the basis of pending litigation.","asker":"1259","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":3322,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the daa\u00a0has statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop Dublin Airport, including the North Runway project. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As previously stated,\u00a0the legal proceedings in question are not, in fact, completed.

a new rail Central Traffic Control Centre; progress on the DART Expansion Programme to include increase rail fleet and further progress\u00a0on electrification of both the Northern rail line to Balbriggan and the\u00a0Maynooth line.<\/p><p>-  funding of almost &euro;460 million investment in light rail for additional Luas capacity -\u00a0with additional trams and longer trams across the Luas network -\u00a0and to progress the Metro Link, with construction work starting on the project in 2021, and passenger services\u00a0commencing in 2027.<\/p><p>-  investment in maintenance and safety projects to maintain safety and service levels in railway operations of our national railway system.<\/p><p>-  multi-annual funding of almost &euro;30 million over the next four years to continue the programme of retro-fitting older, existing public transport facilities to improve their accessibility features.\u00a0 This effectively triples the previously planned investment amount.<\/p><p>-  funding in the region of &euro;130 million over the next four years for traffic management, bus priority and other smarter travel projects in our cities.<\/p><p>-  &euro;35 million to back new ideas that will help\u00a0decarbonise the transport sector, including pilot initiatives for low emission technologies. This is complemented by the investing of &euro;15\u00a0million in lower energy lighting on national roads.<\/p><p>Building on the enhanced 4-year capital allocations to Departments announced last October as part of Budget 2018, more recently we have now published the\u00a0new\u00a0National Development Plan (NDP)\u00a0which will run from 2018 to 2027.\u00a0 It sets out how the State's overall\u00a0capital investment of &euro;116 billion for the\u00a0lifetime of the NDP\u00a0is being allocated on a thematic basis across all ten of the\u00a0National Strategic Objectives (NSOs) that are identified\u00a0in the National Planning Framework (NPF).\u00a0 The NDP sets out Strategic Investment Priorities and indicates some of the specific investments which have been identified\u00a0by the relevant Departments, including my own, as central to the delivery of the NPF vision.\u00a0 The NDP\u00a0is a 10-year investment plan and it recognises that there are\u00a0different planning and delivery horizons applying to different types of capital expenditure depending, for example,\u00a0on whether they involve\u00a0the construction or development of\u00a0major\u00a0new infrastructure, the purchase of new capital assets, protecting the quality\u00a0and value of existing infrastructure, or providing\u00a0a programme of\u00a0capital grants.<\/p><p>The NDP will enable extensive investment across Ireland's\u00a0transport sector, supporting and will support\u00a0the overall development of an integrated and sustainable national public transport system.\u00a0\u00a0Investment priorities to be delivered over the full lifetime of the NDP include the following:<\/p><p>-  delivery of the BusConnects programme,<\/p><p>-  provision\u00a0of additional capacity on the Luas Green Line; <\/p><p>-  construction and opening\u00a0of the new MetroLink;<\/p><p>-  delivery of priority elements of the DART Expansion Programme, including investment in new train fleet,\u00a0and extended electrification;<\/p><p>-  investment to protect the quality and value of the existing\u00a0rail network and to support safety and service levels;<\/p><p>-  investment in strategic park and ride sites including investment in expanding existing parking facilities at rail and Luas locations; <\/p><p>-  completing\u00a0construction of the National Train Control Centre and the city centre resignalling project; <\/p><p>-  supporting programmes of railway and bus station improvement\/development;<\/p><p>-  passenger information programmes; <\/p><p>-  accessibility enhancements; <\/p><p>-  smarter travel projects along with new urban walking and cycling routes; and <\/p><p>-  the appraisal, planning and design of LUAS network expansions to ensure readiness when and where extensions are needed.<\/p><p>It is worth noting that as part of the annual Estimates process, the multi-annual capital allocations for Government Departments under the NDP will be reviewed and extended annually on a rolling basis to cover the coming 5-year period.\u00a0 This will provide Government with an annual opportunity to review the allocations in light of any implementation issues arising and\/or new priorities which may emerge as the NDP is implemented.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The NDP also commits to a full mid-term review of the Plan in 2022, to allow Government to take stock of progress in terms of delivery of the planned projects and programmes, and to allow Government to review and reaffirm its investment priorities.\u00a0 It is envisaged that the review will be carried out in order to prepare and publish a new updated 10-year plan for public capital investment in 2023, covering the period 2023 to 2032. <\/p><p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.\u00a0 The National Transport Authority (NTA) - working with the other relevant State bodies - is responsible in the main for ensuring the planning and delivery of the public transport infrastructure priorities.\u00a0 Therefore, in light of the NTA&rsquo;s\u00a0role, I have forwarded the Deputy&rsquo;s questions to the NTA for further response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700126#WRSSS03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3410,"content":"<p>Question Nos. 1256 to 1261, inclusive, answered with Question No. 1234.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Facilities Expenditure","counter":3411,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700127#WRTTT01000"},{"type":"question","counter":3412,"qnumday":1262,"qnumall":"[15513\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700127#WRTTT01100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the funding allocated to the delivery of the national velodrome and badminton centre in each of the years 2019 to 2023;

Furthermore, Government&rsquo;s Public Transport investment priorities are also set out in the recently published National Development Plan (NDP) and include the aim of\u00a0improving and expanding attractive and sustainable public transport capacity alternatives to private based car transport to reduce congestion in the Dublin Area. These alternatives include programmes such as BusConnects, MetroLink, DART expansion, continued investment in Dublin's light rail and heavy rail networks, cycling and walking and traffic management measures. These programmes will be implemented by the NTA which has statutory responsibility for development of Public Transport in the GDA. All the planned investment in public transport combined will add greatly to the choice and experience of the travelling public, connecting more people with more places and ease congestion in Ireland&rsquo;s cities.<\/p>  <p>  Noting\u00a0the responsibility of the NTA in this matter, I have forwarded the Deputy's questions to the NTA for a more detailed reply.\u00a0Please inform my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700130#WRWWW03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Network","counter":3519,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700130#WRWWW03400"},{"type":"question","counter":3520,"qnumday":1316,"qnumall":"[16331\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700130#WRWWW03500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied) regarding road markings in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":3521,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.\u00a0 The planning, design and operation\u00a0of individual roads\u00a0is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.\u00a0 Within the budget available to it, the allocation of funding to individual projects is a matter for TII.<\/p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred the Deputy's questions to TII for direct reply.\u00a0\u00a0Please advise my private office if you don't receive a reply within 10 working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700130#WRWWW03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety Authority Campaigns","counter":3522,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700130#WRWWW03700"},{"type":"question","counter":3523,"qnumday":1317,"qnumall":"[16385\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700130#WRWWW03800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the amount spent by the Road Safety Authority, RSA, in 2017 and to date in 2018, on promoted social media advertisements and content by the amount spent per campaign and social media platform; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":3524,"content":"<p>This is a matter for the Road Safety Authority.

The purpose of the assessment is to reach a preliminary conclusion about unmet need and risk of harm in order to plan and provide an appropriate response.<\/p><p>Where, following initial assessment or at any other juncture in the child protection and welfare process, it is necessary to carry out a more specific or comprehensive analysis of a child&lsquo;s circumstances, a further assessment will be undertaken. Further assessment may be in the form of a core social work assessment or may be based on specialist assessment by an allied service &ndash; e.g. addiction services, child psychology or adult mental health. <\/p><p>When an initial assessment concludes that a child has unmet needs requiring Social Work intervention but the child is not at ongoing risk of significant harm, a Family Support Plan is agreed with the family and reviewed at intervals not exceeding 6 months. The Family Support Plan may be developed at a formal meeting or by informal contacts with the child, family and professionals involved. <\/p><p>Where, following initial assessment, the primary concern is physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse or neglect, and it is determined that a child is at ongoing risk of significant harm, the child protection process outlines the pathway that must be followed. Formal oversight of the safeguarding of this cohort of children by the Principal Social Worker for Children and Family Services is a crucial feature of the child protection process.<\/p><p>The criteria for a member of the public or a mandated person to consider a referral of a child protection or welfare concern\u00a0is also\u00a0detailed in Children First National Guidance and in\u00a0Tusla's Children First Guide\u00a0for the Reporting of Child Welfare and Protection Concerns.\u00a0All these\u00a0documents are accessible to the public through the Tusla website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700131#WRXXX04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts Data","counter":3578,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700131#WRXXX04200"},{"type":"question","counter":3579,"qnumday":1336,"qnumall":"[15204\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700131#WRXXX04300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the amount of expenditure on consultancy by her Department in each of the years 2015 to 2017; the number of consultants engaged by her Department in those years; the names of the consultancy companies awarded contracts; and the steps that have been taken to reduce the expenditure on consultancy and the reliance on consultants by her Department in these years and for the future.","asker":"1349","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3580,"content":"<p>My Department engages a wide variety of professional services to provide advice within a particular field of expertise where such expertise is not readily available within my Department.

The capital expenditure is supplemented by some &euro;7.7m in respect of capital carried forward from 2017.<\/p><p>The figures referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question are drawn from the Fiscal Monitor, which reflects the\u00a0estimate of monthly expenditure. <\/p><p>I have set out in the attached table details of actual expenditure to end of March against profile (current (-23%)\u00a0and capital (-65%)) as requested. These differ slightly from the figures referenced by the Deputy as they take account of payments made at the end of March which were not foreseen at the time of the compilation of the Fiscal Monitor figures.<\/p><p>Current expenditure was behind profile at end March largely due to timing differences in the payment of funding\u00a0in respect of the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) (Subhead B4) which is distributed across Ireland&rsquo;s 51 geographic SICAP Lots. Significant payments amounting to &euro;9.5 million which were originally scheduled to be made in March were paid out in early April and will be reflected in the end-April expenditure report.\u00a0<\/p><p>A significant portion of capital underspend against profile at the end of March relates to the Town and\u00a0Village Scheme (Subhead A8), which funds capital projects administered by the Local Authorities.\u00a0 I am conscious of the particular demands which were placed on Local Authorities in the early months of this year in responding to severe weather emergencies and these may have been a contributory factor to the underspend. However, my Department is in regular contact with Local Authorities and other stakeholders\u00a0with a view to accelerating activity on all capital schemes, including the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and I expect to see an increase in capital spending as the year progresses.<\/p><p>For example, while the LEADER programme also shows an underspend against profile to the end of March, the delivery of this programme on the ground is continuing to grow rapidly.\u00a0 At the end of March 2018, 852 projects with a value of over &euro;24.3 million had been approved for funding by the LEADER Local Action Groups.\u00a0 More than 200 further projects were going through the approvals process.\u00a0 Payments will be made to all of these projects\u00a0as they become operational and submit payment claims.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Finally,\u00a0it should be noted that all figures provided are provisional, pending audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Department is also in the process of building a financial system which will be incorporated into the Shared Services for Payroll and there may be some minor revisions to figures as that process is completed.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Current<\/th><th>Profile<\/th><th>Expenditure<\/th><th>Difference<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>V42 &ndash;

Such property includes all monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares and houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use.  However, it does not include property such as the family home or, for example, a premises used by the claimant in carrying out a business. <\/p><p>The capital assessment formula for social assistance schemes provides for an initial disregard of a certain amount of capital, and an increasing notional weekly value for amounts in excess of the disregarded amount.  For most schemes, such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, farm assist, one-parent family payment and the state pension non-contributory, the initial disregard is &euro;20,000 of capital.  The capital disregard in the case of disability allowance is &euro;50,000 and, for supplementary welfare allowance, is &euro;5,000. <\/p><p>The capital assessment formula is outlined in the table below.<table><tr><th>AMOUNT OF CAPITAL<\/th><th>WEEKLY MEANS ASSESSED<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Initial capital disregard for the scheme<\/td><td>Nil<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Next &euro;10,000 <\/td><td>&euro;1 per each &euro;1,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Following &euro;10,000<\/td><td>&euro;2 per each &euro;1,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Remainder<\/td><td>&euro;4 per each &euro;1,000<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The amount of savings that a person can have and still qualify for a part payment varies by scheme.  For instance, some schemes, such as the state pension non-contributory, one-parent family payment and carer&rsquo;s allowance, have a general means disregard.  State pension non-contributory (SPNC) has a general means disregard of &euro;30 per week.  This means that a person in receipt of SPNC with no other income can have savings of &euro;40,000 (which would result in a weekly means assessment from capital of &euro;30) and qualify for the maximum weekly rate of payment.  An SPNC recipient can have up to &euro;257.70 of weekly means and qualify for a minimum payment.  Accordingly, a single pensioner could have &euro;96,000 in savings and no other means, which would be assessed as &euro;254 weekly means and a weekly SPNC payment of &euro;7 per week.  The pensioner could also qualify for fuel allowance, the household benefits package, the living alone increase, the new telephone support allowance, and Free Travel.<\/p><p>A jobseeker can have &euro;20,000 in savings and qualify for the maximum weekly rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  A single claimant could have savings of &euro;80,000 and no other means, which would be assessed as weekly means of &euro;190.  The jobseeker could qualify for a &euro;8 per week payment, and be eligible for a range of employment supports.<\/p><p>It should be noted that no account is taken of interest or dividend payments received in the means assessment.  The assessment formula reflects the fact that there is an expectation that people with reasonable amounts of capital and property are in a position to use that capital or to realise the value of property to support themselves without having to rely solely on a means-tested welfare payment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700136#WRCCCC04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"JobPath Programme","counter":3829,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700136#WRCCCC04700"},{"type":"question","counter":3830,"qnumday":1423,"qnumall":"[15409\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700136#WRCCCC04800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the full extent and scale of the services provided to her Department by Seetec Ireland; if she has received complaints regarding the manner in which the public are dealt with; if action is warranted or has been taken arising therefrom; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":3831,"content":"<p>Seetec is one of two companies contracted to provide the JobPath service on behalf of my Department.

In the case of individuals who have more than one income source, PRSI is generally paid on all forms of income.  <\/p>  <p>  Prior to 2013, exemptions from PRSI applied to the self-employed income of specific groups.  These exemptions have since been abolished. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2013, modified rate employees contributors (i.e. civil and public servants recruited prior to 1995) who also have income from self-employment or unearned income over &euro;5,000 per annum are liable to pay PRSI on that income which was previously exempt.  This income is liable at the class K rate of 4%.  Entitlement to social insurance benefits does not accrue from the payment of this charge.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 2014, all employees (in the public and private sector) and occupational pensioners under 66 years, with unearned income only, are liable to pay Class K PRSI on that annual unearned income where it exceeds &euro;5,000.  Class K PRSI is charged at 4% and does not give access to social insurance entitlements based on the payment of the charge.  Prior to 2014 these employees were exempt from PRSI on such unearned income, which includes rental and investment income, dividends and interest on deposits.  This provision applies to all employees, regardless of the PRSI class they pay on their employment income.  <\/p>  <p>  All workers pay PRSI on their earnings from employment.  If an employee has income from self-employment e.g. taxi driver, farmer etc. he or she also pays PRSI as a self-employed contributor on the profits from, say, the taxi driving plus any other unearned income he or she might have e.g. rental income.  The measure to charge Class K PRSI on employees who were previously exempt was introduced to ensure equity by ensuring that PRSI is chargeable, regardless of the source of the employee&rsquo;s additional income.  <\/p>  <p>  Employees paying Class K PRSI on unearned income can generate entitlement to social insurance benefits based on PRSI they pay on their employment income.  Class A employees with unearned income already have access to the full range of social insurance benefits, because of their PRSI Class A status.  Modified rate employees have access to a limited range of social insurance benefits but have entitlement to generous Exchequer-funded occupational pensions.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016 there were 91,068 Class K contributors.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700138#WREEEE03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Question Heading for question(s)  1453","counter":3919,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700138#WREEEE03800"},{"type":"question","counter":3920,"qnumday":1453,"qnumall":"[16219\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700138#WREEEE03900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of an application for disability allowance by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":3921,"content":"<p>I confirm that my department received an application for disability allowance (DA) from this lady on 27 March 2018.

It should be noted that the total build output may also include a small number of turnkey developments not built on State lands but funded through the same capital programme.

The Department is not aware of any developments for residential units to be built on other publicly owned land which are currently with An Bord Plean&aacute;la. <\/p><p>The delivery of additional social and affordable homes, to buy or rent, will rely on the State developing the full potential of its residential land bank. Following the second Housing Summit in January 2018, local authorities were asked to submit their plans to develop their land bank for social and wider housing development, including an outline of their respective proposed affordable housing programmes and to indicate their social housing delivery out to 2021. My Department is currently working through these returns and I will be announcing delivery targets for all local authorities very shortly.<\/p><p>From a longer-term strategic perspective, as part of Project Ireland 2040, the Government announced on 16 February its intention to establish a new National Regeneration and Development Agency, which will have a role in managing the State's wider publicly-owned land bank to ensure that overall development needs, including housing, are met. The new Agency will work closely with local authorities, Government Departments, Agencies and other State and semi-State bodies to secure the best use of public lands and ensure the delivery on the objectives of the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan.<\/p><p>Regarding the social housing Public Private Partnership (PPP) programme, which the Deputy refers to, this provides for an investment of &euro;300 million and is expected to deliver 1,500 social housing units in total, via three bundles. The first bundle, comprises six PPP sites delivering over 500 units in the greater Dublin area.  Two of the sites are located in Dublin City, with one each in South Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Louth.  Dublin City Council has been appointed to act as the lead local authority for the delivery of this first bundle. The second bundle, comprising eight PPP sites, will deliver over 450 units across the country. Three of the sites are located in County Cork, with one each in the cities of Galway and Waterford. There is a further one site in each of counties Clare, Kildare and Roscommon.  Cork County Council is the lead local authority for this bundle. Sites for the third bundle are currently being identified and will be announced in the coming months.<\/p><p>The PPP programme complements the increased exchequer-funded capital expenditure, which is part of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan.  It allows for more social housing to be built in the context of available State resources. The sites being used will remain in local authority ownership and are being provided under licence for the duration of the 25-year PPP contract.The PPP programme is based on what is termed an &lsquo;availability-based&rsquo; PPP model, in which a private sector company designs, builds, finances and maintains the social housing units over a 25 year period in return for a monthly &lsquo;unitary payment&rsquo;.  The housing units will be handed back to the local authority after 25 years in a predefined, good quality condition. The sites will remain in State ownership for the entire period.  <\/p><p>It should be noted that the Office of Public Works (OPW) has the central role in managing the State&rsquo;s diverse property portfolio, and is responsible for co-ordinating policy in maintaining and efficiently organising the property asset portfolio of the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700141#WRHHHH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postal Voting","counter":4040,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700141#WRHHHH00800"},{"type":"question","counter":4041,"qnumday":1497,"qnumall":"[16950\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700141#WRHHHH00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to extend postal voting rights to persons who are due to be abroad on holidays on 25 May 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":4042,"qnumday":1525,"qnumall":"[15321\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700141#WRHHHH01000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to extend the postal vote system for persons who are out of the country further than the persons currently provided for, such as consular staff and families, Defence Forces and so on, on polling days for referendums and elections; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":4043,"qnumday":1537,"qnumall":"[15453\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700141#WRHHHH01100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to make the supplement to the postal voters list available to those voters who on polling day have elective medical procedures, are in the final stages of pregnancy or are in the early stages after a pregnancy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1434","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":4044,"qnumday":1552,"qnumall":"[15592\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700141#WRHHHH01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his views on extending the entitlement to a postal vote to those who are on holidays on polling day, abroad on pilgrimage, overseas on education courses or abroad working on a part-time basis; his further views on this in the context of the forthcoming referendum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1289","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":4045,"qnumday":1569,"qnumall":"[15900\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700141#WRHHHH01300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a postal vote will be given to a person who has already made travel arrangements and will not be in the country on the date of the referendum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4046,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1497, 1525, 1537, 1552 and 1569 together.<\/p><p>Postal voting is provided for in electoral law in respect of a number of categories of electors - whole-time members of the Defence Forces, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses\/civil partners, electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability, electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day, full-time students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State, prisoners and certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside.

recommendation in the Fifth Report of the Convention on the Constitution that Irish citizens resident outside the State, including citizens resident in Northern Ireland, should have the right to vote at presidential elections and that a referendum would be held to amend the Constitution to seek to give effect to this.\u00a0 In order to inform public discourse on this significant policy change, an Options Paper was published on 22 March 2017 by my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.<\/p><p>The Options Paper, which is available on my Department's website at <i><i>www.housing.gov.ie<\/i><\/i>, sets out a broad range of options for the extension of voting rights, international comparisons, the estimated costs involved and related resource issues as well as

the most likely means by which Irish citizens resident outside the State could exercise their right to vote if a referendum were to be held and passed by the people in due course.<\/p><p>To address a

elections to Irish citizens resident outside the State which it is intended will be held on the same date as the local and European elections in late May\/early June 2019.\u00a0 My Department will, in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, bring forward an appropriate Constitution Amendment Bill on extending the franchise at Presidential elections to Irish citizens resident

02\/2018 to planning authorities on\u00a09 March 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of this Circular was to remind planning authorities and elected members that\u00a0they are required to consider planning applications in accordance with the open, transparent and verifiable written process set down in planning legislation and that planning authorities, when making their decisions, are restricted to considering the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned.<\/p>  <p>  The Circular further indicates that, while the statutory Development Management Guidelines issued to planning authorities under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, recognise that elected members may be informed by planning staff of factual matters relating to particular planning applications, the provision of such information is intended to\u00a0inform elected members who may wish to make substantive comments on planning applications by way of formal written submissions or observations to the planning authority.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the Circular points out that discussion of the merits of individual planning applications at Municipal District and Area Committee meetings or full Council meetings does not form part of the statutory process for the consideration of planning applications, and that the practice could be viewed as an attempt to undermine due process and exert undue influence on the planning authority to make a decision that would not be in the interests of the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned. The Circular also states that the practice of discussing planning applications at relevant Council meetings could convey an erroneous impression to the public of the role of elected members in the statutory process for deciding on planning applications.<\/p>  <p>  As the Circular restates and does not amend the relevant provisions of the Development Management Guidelines issued to planning authorities, it was not necessary to seek legal advice or to formulate further statutory guidance in the matter.\u00a0 The Circular was issued to planning authorities as part of the normal process of communication by my Department with planning authorities in relation to issues of common concern and with a view to ensuring that common approaches and practices are adopted by planning authorities in the performance of their statutory planning functions generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700141#WRHHHH02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Audit Service","counter":4054,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700141#WRHHHH02600"},{"type":"question","counter":4055,"qnumday":1503,"qnumall":"[14954\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700141#WRHHHH02700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the town and borough councils that had an auditor's report prepared and issued by the Local Government Audit Service for 2013, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1218","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":4056,"qnumday":1504,"qnumall":"[14955\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700141#WRHHHH02800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the town and borough councils that did not have an auditor's report prepared and issued by the Local Government Audit Service for 2013, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1218","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4057,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1503 and 1504 together.<\/p>  <p>  Government policy on local government reform was set out in the Putting People First, Action Programme for Effective Local Government (the &lsquo;Action Programme&rsquo;).<\/p>  <p>  Many of the reforms set out in the Action Programme were introduced with effect from 1 June 2014.

Dublin City Council provides fire services on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  My Department supports the fire authorities through setting national policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructure projects. <\/p>  <p>  National policy in relation to fire safety is set out in KCS, which is based on the internationally-used systemic risk management approach and places emphasis on fire prevention and fire protection facilities in buildings, as well as on fire service response. For the first time, this document set out a national process and standards against which local authorities can benchmark their fire services. <\/p>  <p>  This policy document provides for each fire service to undertake an Area Risk Categorisation process in respect of each of its fire station areas. In 2013\/14, following the publication of &ldquo;Keeping Communities Safe&rdquo;, and before the Grenfell Tower fire occurred in June 2017, each fire authority undertook an initial area risk categorisation process for its functional area and reported on the process. \u00a0The outcome of this process is a judgement by fire service management to establish a risk grading across very high risk, high risk, medium risk, low risk or very low risk categories. The initial fire station risk ratings for Ireland&rsquo;s 217 fire stations are published in the 2016 report &ldquo;Local Delivery &ndash; National Consistency &ndash; Fire Services in Ireland&rdquo;, a copy of which is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie\/local-government\/fire-and-emergency-management\/fire-services-ireland-local-delivery-national.<\/p>  <p>  The approach to undertaking the initial Area Risk Categorisation Process is set out in KCS. The Area Risk Categorisation process uses nine specific criteria, including 3 years of actual fire data, census data relating to population of main urban areas, the total population of the station ground, the number of dwellings in the station ground and the annual dwelling fire rate. The initial process was based on analysis of three years of actual fire data generated from the three Computer Aided Mobilisation (CAMP) Centres. This provided spatial analysis of fire service historical incident data in line with the international trend towards the use of a risk-based approach to managing emergency service provision. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is the predominant risk in an area that defines its risk categorisation. While buildings with significant hazards may be identified\/highlighted as part of the process, it is not seen as necessary or appropriate to undertake a building by building appraisal for the purposes of the initial area risk categorisation process. An area risk categorisation process does not assess compliance of hospitals or other individual buildings with fire safety standards, as appears to be\u00a0suggested in two of the Deputy's Questions. <\/p>  <p>  However, significant buildings are readily known by the people working in each station ground and, based on a prioritisation by local fire station officers, fire services undertake &ldquo;Pre-Incident Planning&rdquo; in relation to what they perceive as the individual major fire risk buildings within their fire station areas. It is a matter for Dublin City Council to identify and prioritise buildings for \"Pre-Incident Planning\" in the Dublin area.<\/p>  <p>  I am not in a position to say, and the Deputy should be advised by Dublin City Council, as to what buildings are prioritised and have been through the pre-incident planning process in the Dublin area. <\/p>  <p>  Over the course of 2014\/2015, the National Directorate Management Board's External Validation Group (EVG) visited every fire service in the country as part of a new external validation of area risk categorisation in Ireland.\u00a0 In April 2016, the Board published the first EVG report titled &ldquo;Local Delivery - National Consistency&rdquo;. The report concluded, inter alia, that:<\/p>  <p>  -  Fire\u00a0Services are applying and refining internationally-recognised risk\u00a0management approaches to reduce the fire risk and the annual toll of life\u00a0and property loss caused by fire.<\/p>  <p>  -  Local\u00a0authorities are matching the assessed fire risk in their individual fire\u00a0station areas with services based on both full-time and retained fire\u00a0service models, with a comprehensive support infrastructure, and applying\u00a0a range of appropriate fire prevention and fire protection approaches.<\/p>  <p>  -  Local\u00a0authorities have prioritised and maintained the financial and personnel\u00a0resources in their fire services at a time when they have implemented\u00a0significant reductions in all other areas.<\/p>  <p>  -  Local\u00a0authorities have benchmarked their fire services against national\u00a0standards and national norms, and a strong degree of consistency, linked\u00a0to area risk categorisation, now exists in fire service provision; all\u00a0local authorities are using, or are working towards, national norms as\u00a0minimum standards.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from the work of the EVG, I am satisfied that the fire services provided in Ireland are operating to appropriate standards.<\/p>  <p>  A consultation exercise with staffing interests was commenced in March 2016 through the Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group (FSNOIG) with a view to identifying potential enhancements to the initial Area Risk Categorisation and associated external validation process. The initial area risk categorisation reports of all 27 fire services, as well as the External Validation Group report referred to above, were\u00a0provided to the staff side at that time. However, no progress has been made between management and the staff side in relation to identifying specific issues with the current process or potential enhancements.<\/p>  <p>  The initial area risk categorisation process undertaken in Dublin was in line with national guidance and the fire station risk ratings for Dublin are included in the 2016 report &ldquo;Local Delivery &ndash; National Consistency &ndash; Fire Services in Ireland&rdquo; referred to above.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700141#WRHHHH03645","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":4071,"qnumday":1509,"qnumall":"[15056\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700141#WRHHHH03672","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the advice given to residents of high rise buildings in the event of fire breaking out - if it is to remain in the building or to evacuate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1311","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4072,"content":"<p>In accordance with section 18(2) of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, it is the responsibility of the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; over the premises to ensure the safety of persons in the premises in the event of fire. The fire safety strategy and associated procedures to ensure the safety of people in any high-rise building is usually, therefore, the responsibility of the relevant management company. The management of the building puts procedures in place, including procedures for evacuation of the building in the event of fire, based on implementing the design strategy for fire safety in that building. It is the responsibility of the person having control also to ensure that all building occupants are aware of and practiced in the arrangements in place and that fire detection and alarm systems are operating and maintained in accordance with relevant standards.<\/p>  <p>  In most buildings and circumstances, the safest approach and the default option is for all occupants of the building to evacuate in the event of a fire or a fire alarm being activated. Special provisions are necessary for buildings, such as hospitals or nursing homes, where evacuation of patients or residents may not be feasible or advisable.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of buildings containing flats, the current fire safety guidance provides for two-tier fire detection and alarm systems. Firstly, each flat should be provided with its own internal domestic detection and alarm system, which gives an initial warning only within the flat when fire or smoke is detected. The intention is that residents should evacuate, closing doors behind them, in the event of a fire or alarm in their own flat.\u00a0 Secondly, for protection of the shared areas of the building, a fire detection and alarm system is provided to detect fire or smoke in the shared escape routes, or a developing fire in an individual flat which may begin to threaten the shared escape routes.\u00a0Buildings containing flats are intended to have a degree of fire resistance, to prevent the fire spreading beyond the flat of origin. This second system will give warning to residents throughout the building. Generally, unless alternative procedures are specified, where residents receive warning of a fire in the building, they should evacuate the building.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of very large or high rise buildings containing flats, there is provision for the fire detection and alarm system to initially\u00a0warn the occupants in the areas of the building most likely to be affected by fire.\u00a0 In this way, phased evacuation can be provided for. Following the initial warning, the fire detection and alarm system can give warning in areas more remote from the fire.<\/p>  <p>  In all cases, residents of premises containing flats should be informed by the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; regarding the strategy and arrangements in place in their particular building.<\/p>  <p>  Where fire services attend a fire in a building containing flats, the Incident Commander may decide to instruct an evacuation of the building, or, where it is considered that a fire is small, with localised effects, and can be readily brought under control, they may advise residents to stay in place while the fire is brought under control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700141#WRHHHH03686","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4073,"content":"<p>Question No. 1510 answered with Question No. 1507.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacant Properties Data","counter":4074,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700141#WRHHHH03700"},{"type":"question","counter":4075,"qnumday":1511,"qnumall":"[15058\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700141#WRHHHH03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his views on the accuracy of figures for vacant housing in view of the fact that the CSO refused to publish Garda figures for homicide on the grounds of debatable accuracy.","asker":"1311","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4076,"content":"<p>The Central Statistics Office is the principal statutory compiler and publisher of official statistics in Ireland, and the 5-yearly Census is a detailed account which records and classifies, inter alia, all households and dwelling types throughout the country on a particular night.

process provided for in the national policy document &ldquo;Keeping Communities Safe - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland&rdquo; which was published by my Department in February 2013. For the first time, this document set out a national process and standards against which local authorities can benchmark their fire services.  A copy of  &ldquo;Keeping Communities Safe - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland&rdquo; is available on my Department's website at: <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>This policy document provides for each fire service to undertake an Area Risk Categorisation process in respect of each of its fire station areas. In 2013\/14, following the publication of &ldquo;Keeping Communities Safe&rdquo;, each fire authority undertook an initial area risk categorisation for its functional area and reported on the process. The outcome of this process is a judgement by fire service management to establish a risk grading across very high risk, high risk, medium risk, low risk or very low risk categories. The initial fire station risk ratings for Ireland&rsquo;s 217 fire stations are published in the 2016 report &ldquo;Local Delivery &ndash; National Consistency &ndash; Fire Services in Ireland&rdquo;. A copy of  &ldquo;Local Delivery &ndash; National Consistency &ndash; Fire Services in Ireland&rdquo; is available on my Department's website at:<\/p><p><i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The Keeping Communities Policy document requires fire services to have an initial response capability in place which is linked to the assessed Area Risk Category. Arising from the work of the External Validation Group mandated by the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management which prepared the &ldquo;Local Delivery &ndash; National Consistency&rdquo; report referred to above, I am satisfied that the fire services provided in Ireland are meeting the appropriate standards. <\/p><p>The Area Risk Categorisation process uses nine specific criteria, including 3 years of actual fire data, and it was not considered necessary or appropriate for the area risk categorisation process to look at fire safety in individual buildings. For individual buildings, fire services, based on a prioritisation by local fire station officers, undertake &ldquo;Pre-Incident Planning&rdquo; in relation to what they perceive as the major fire risk buildings within their fire station areas. <\/p><p>The fire in Grenfell Tower occurred in June 2017, a number of years after the initial area risk categorisation process had been completed by fire authorities. In this context, the connection suggested in the Question between the cause of the fire in Grenfell Tower (an individual building) and the area risk categorisation process undertaken by fire authorities (an area based process) is unclear. <\/p><p>Following the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy, my Department asked fire authorities to identify buildings of more than six stories or more than 18m in height in their functional areas. Among these medium to high rise buildings, fire authorities were asked to identify those buildings with cladding and to consider if the use of the power under section 18(6) of the Fire Service Acts 1981 and 2003, to require the person having control over the building to carry out a fire safety assessment of the building, including the cladding, was warranted. <\/p><p>In December 2017, my Department issued a guidance note &quot;Fire Safety Guidance Note 01 of 2017 Assessing Existing Cladding Systems in Buildings of More than Six Storeys, or More than 18m in Height&quot;. The guidance note was circulated to fire authorities and placed on my Department&rsquo;s website as a support for those undertaking assessments of cladding in existing medium to high rise buildings.

The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, <i>www.pyriteboard.ie<\/i>. <\/p><p>The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established, in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.\u00a0 In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.\u00a0 Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.\u00a0 This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.\u00a0 I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion.<\/p><p>Where a dwelling, otherwise not eligible for inclusion in the scheme, adjoins a dwelling already included in the scheme, such a dwelling may be considered in accordance with the exceptional circumstance provisions set out in section 17 of the Act.

This remains the position with regard to dwellings which do not display significant pyritic damage. <\/p><p>On foot of this recommendation of the Pyrite Panel, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) published I.S. 398-1:2013 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol in 2013.The standard provides the means by which dwellings that may be affected by pyrite can be tested and categorised. <\/p><p>In late 2015, the NSAI commenced a review of I.S. 398-1:2013 in the light of practical experience since the standard was first introduced in January 2013. The standard was updated and revised to reflect the on-site experiences and evidence gathered by technical experts, such as engineers, geologists, professionals providing sampling and testing services and other technical experts, who have been using the standard over the past four years and was published on 4 August 2017.<\/p><p>I welcome the revised standard published by the NSAI and in this context I signed the Pyrite Resolution (Standard for Testing) Regulations 2017 (S.I. No. 556 of 2017) on 6 December 2017. These Regulations provide that pursuant to section 14(9)(a) of the Pyrite Resolution Act 2013, the &ldquo;standard for testing&rdquo; for the purpose of the Act shall be Irish Standard 398-1:2017 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &mdash;Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol, as published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland on 4 August 2017. <\/p><p>Any amendments which the Pyrite Resolution Board consider are required to the scheme as a result of the revised standard will be given full consideration should they be submitted to me in accordance with the requirements of the Act.<\/p><p>The latest figures available indicate that a total of 2,031 applications have been received under the pyrite remediation scheme.\u00a0 Of the 2,031 applications received so far, 1,594 dwellings have been included in the pyrite remediation scheme and the applicants notified accordingly.<\/p><p>A further 85 applications have been validated and referred to the Housing Agency for the Assessment and Verification Process, while another 225 applications are at the initial Application and Validation Process. 127 applications under the scheme were not successful.<\/p><p>Of the 1,594 dwellings that have been included in the pyrite remediation scheme:<\/p><p>- 284\u00a0are at remedial works planning stage, <\/p><p>- 85\u00a0are at tender \/ tender analysis,<\/p><p>- 208\u00a0are under remediation, and\u00a0 <\/p><p>- 1,017 are complete.\u00a0<\/p><p>A sum of &euro;30 million was announced under Budget 2018 to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme this year.  This allocation will facilitate the remediation of some 430 additional dwellings and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700142#WRJJJJ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residential Property Sales","counter":4110,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700142#WRJJJJ02200"},{"type":"question","counter":4111,"qnumday":1524,"qnumall":"[15300\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700142#WRJJJJ02300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if legislative proposals are being considered to examine the legal principle of caveat emptor in respect of property transactions with the view to giving added protection to buyers and to guard against potential losses being suffered by home owners owing to structural defects which may have been undetected at the time of purchase; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4112,"content":"<p>The examination of the\u00a0principle of <i>caveat emptor<\/i>in respect of property transactions is a\u00a0complex legal matter with potential\u00a0implications for the entire legal system, as well as for the insurance industry. <\/p><p>In this context, in February 2018, my\u00a0Department wrote\u00a0to the Law Reform Commission and also corresponded with those involved with the review of the administration of Civil Justice in Ireland,\u00a0requesting that they consider the issue\u00a0of\u00a0effective and accessible legal remedies for homeowners who discover defects in their homes.<\/p><p>In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, i.e. the homeowner, the builder, the developer and\/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme.

The Regulations provide that, subject to the applicant meeting all qualification criteria, a local authority may pay a grant to a person who is required, following an inspection, to undertake repairs or upgrades to, or replacement of, a septic tank or other domestic waste water treatment system.  Applications for grant aid are administered by the local authority in whose functional area the particular domestic waste water treatment system requiring remediation is situated.

The scheme is being extended in order to provide particular support to high status waters and areas identified for priority action in the River Basin Management Plan.<\/p><p>I have recently approved the establishment of a Working Group to conduct a review of the wider investment needs relating to rural water services.  The review will focus on the actions required to improve and sustain rural water services and will consider issues such as governance, supervision and monitoring of the sector, in addition to capital investment priorities and requirements across all elements of rural water services, including domestic waste water treatment systems.  The establishment of the Working Group is being undertaken in response to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.<\/p><p>In its April 2017 Report the Committee recommended that, &ldquo;the principles of equity of treatment and equivalent financial support should be applied equally between households on public water supplies and those availing of private water services&rdquo;, and that my Department should conduct a review in consultation with relevant stakeholders &ldquo;to quantify what additional investment will be required to equalise treatment between those availing of domestic water services and those availing of private services.&rdquo;  The review will consider how best to position and resource water services in rural areas so that they can contribute further to the development and long-term sustainability of a comprehensive and cohesive Rural Water Sector that will have the capacity to produce quality outcomes comparable to those available to customers of public water services.<\/p><p>The Terms of Reference of the review provide that there will be a two-strand approach to the considerations of the Working Group.  Strand 1 will consider the composition and distribution of funding for the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme from 2019 up to 2021, while Strand 2 will consider the more complex longer-focus issues surrounding the long-term future resourcing of the Rural Water Sector.  It is intended that by the end of July 2018, the Working Group will produce a summary report on Strand 1 of its deliberations which will outline the rationale for funding priorities for the next cycle of the Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme up to 2021.  At that time the Working Group will also set out time frames for its consideration of and reporting on the more complex longer-focus (Strand 2) matters.<\/p><p>The organisations that are participating on the Working Group reflect the importance and wide ranging impact of the Rural Water Sector.  In addition to my Department, the Working Group is to comprise the following other Departments and bodies: the Department of Rural and Community Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Health Service Executive, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and the County and City Management Association.  It is expected that the Working Group will consult with other relevant stakeholders in respect of specific topics under consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700143#WRKKKK03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wastewater Treatment Facilities Inspections","counter":4173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700143#WRKKKK03600"},{"type":"question","counter":4174,"qnumday":1546,"qnumall":"[15570\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700143#WRKKKK03700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of inspections carried out each year since the introduction of mandatory registration of single house wastewater systems in 2012 and 2013, by local authority; the number of these that resulted in work having to be carried out on the system; the number of grants approved; the total cost of the grants by year and local authority area in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4175,"content":"<p>The Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 assigns responsibility to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to make a National Inspection Plan (NIP) for domestic wastewater treatment systems and neither I, nor my Department, has any direct role in monitoring the implementation of the plan by the local authorities.<\/p><p>The EPA was the supervisory body for the purposes of the National Inspection Plan 2013: Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems, which was adopted and published by the EPA in February 2013.

Applications for grant aid are administered by the local authority in whose functional area the particular domestic waste water treatment system requiring remediation is situated.  The local authorities then seek recoupment of the amounts paid from my Department.  Where a local authority pays a grant under the scheme, my Department will recoup to the local authority 100% of the amount paid.<\/p><p>Full details of the scheme, including eligibility criteria, are set out in the explanatory leaflet and application form published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<\/p><p><i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The grants scheme ensures that the limited financial resources available are targeted towards householders, particularly those on lower incomes, who incur expenditure directly as a result of the inspection scheme.  My Department is revising this scheme to better support the programme of measures in the finalised River Basin Management Plan 2018 - 2021 published today.  The scheme is being extended in order to provide particular support to high status waters and areas identified for priority action in the River Basin Management Plan.<\/p><p>I have recently approved the establishment of a Working Group to conduct a review of the wider investment needs relating to rural water services.  The review will focus on the actions required to improve and sustain rural water services and will consider issues such as governance, supervision and monitoring of the sector, in addition to capital investment priorities and requirements across all elements of rural water services, including domestic waste water treatment systems.  The establishment of the Working Group is being undertaken in response to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.<\/p><p>In its April 2017 Report the Committee recommended that, &ldquo;the principles of equity of treatment and equivalent financial support should be applied equally between households on public water supplies and those availing of private water services&rdquo;, and that my Department should conduct a review in consultation with relevant stakeholders &ldquo;to quantify what additional investment will be required to equalise treatment between those availing of domestic water services and those availing of private services.&rdquo;  The review will consider how best to position and resource water services in rural areas so that they can contribute further to the development and long-term sustainability of a comprehensive and cohesive Rural Water Sector that will have the capacity to produce quality outcomes comparable to those available to customers of public water services.<\/p><p>The Terms of Reference of the review provide that there will be a two-strand approach to the considerations of the Working Group.  Strand 1 will consider the composition and distribution of funding for the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme from 2019 up to 2021, while Strand 2 will consider the more complex longer-focus issues surrounding the long-term future resourcing of the Rural Water Sector.  It is intended that by the end of July 2018, the Working Group will produce a summary report on Strand 1 of its deliberations which will outline the rationale for funding priorities for the next cycle of the Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme up to 2021.  At that time the Working Group will also set out time frames for its consideration of and reporting on the more complex longer-focus (Strand 2) matters.<\/p><p>The organisations that are participating on the Working Group reflect the importance and wide ranging impact of the Rural Water Sector.  In addition to my Department, the Working Group is to comprise the following other Departments and bodies: the Department of Rural and Community Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Health Service Executive, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and the County and City Management Association.  It is expected that the Working Group will consult with other relevant stakeholders in respect of specific topics under consideration.<\/p><p>Householders who do not meet the eligibility criteria for the grant under the aforementioned Regulations and who wish to remediate or upgrade their on-site treatment systems may qualify for relief under the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) Scheme introduced pursuant to section 5 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013.  The HRI Scheme covers main residence repairs, renovations and improvements, including the repair or replacement of septic tanks.  The Scheme is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and full details are published on the Revenue Commissioners' website at\u00a0<i><i>www.revenue.ie<\/i><\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700143#WRKKKK04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cead&uacute;nas Imill Tr&aacute; agus Dobharshaothraithe","counter":4181,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700143#WRKKKK04600"},{"type":"question","counter":4182,"qnumday":1550,"qnumall":"[15575\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700143#WRKKKK04700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"an bhfuil c&aacute;s dl&iacute; &aacute; thabhairt n&oacute; an bhfuil bagairt dl&iacute; d&eacute;anta in aghaidh na breithe &oacute;n Roinn cead&uacute;nas imeall tr&aacute; a chead&uacute; d&rsquo;Fhoras na Mara uimh. thag.

The new loan will enable credit worthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties. The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first-time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not otherwise have been able to afford at a higher interest rate.<\/p>  <p>  As with the previous local authority loan offerings, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is available to first-time buyers only.

To this end, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health, is developing policy options for supported housing\/housing with care so that older people have a wider range of accommodation choices available to them, options that will enable them to choose accommodation that is appropriate and suited to their needs. A joint policy statement on Housing for Older People is being finalised and is expected to be published shortly. <\/p>  <p>  The St Michael&rsquo;s Estate site in Inchicore, Dublin 8 has been identified for a \"housing with support\" pilot project under Rebuilding Ireland, which will deliver 52 living with care homes. This project offers the opportunity for an Approved Housing Body (AHB), in this case Circle AHB, who are collaborating with Alone, to design, build and operate a unique development which is intended to set a new standard for the future of housing provision for older people and act as an exemplar for others to follow. The homes are due for completion in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The housing with support model to be provided brings together a range of services and supports - principally relating to housing, community, social and care needs. It seeks to provide an appropriate physical and supportive environment that enables older people to live full lives in their own homes within their own community. The overall aim of this project is to develop a new model of housing for older people where the key components, physical environment and care supports are provided on site, integrated into the community, and are designed with older people at the centre.  The project has been approved for funding of almost &euro;15 million under my Department's Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) with a contribution of &euro;450,000 from the Department of Health towards additional communal facilities for the residents. The Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) provides 100% funding to an AHB for the provision of accommodation for people requiring specific categories of accommodation, including older people. <\/p>  <p>  Exchequer funding is also provided by my Department to local authorities for the delivery of social housing projects, including projects that incorporate housing for older people. In addition, the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability provide a range of grants for improvement works or adaptations to houses in order to facilitate the continued independent occupancy of their own homes. Funding is also provided under the Disabled Persons Grants (DPG) scheme to local authorities for adaptations and extensions to the existing social housing stock to meet the needs of older local authority tenants and people with a disability. <\/p>  <p>  The provision and allocation of social housing  are matters for individual local authorities in accordance with their allocation schemes. Accordingly, my Department does not collect data from local authorities on their allocations to individual categories of applicant. However, planning authorities are required, under section 94 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, to include a housing strategy in their development plans which must outline the authorities&rsquo; plans for the existing and future housing needs of the population of their areas. The strategy must include provisions to ensure that a mixture of house types and sizes is developed to reasonably match the requirements of the different categories of households including the special requirements of older people and people with disabilities.   Housing strategies must also have regard to relevant policies or objectives of the Government. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I wrote to all local authorities in January this year in relation to their overall social housing delivery targets out to 2021 under Rebuilding Ireland. Specifically my letter indicated that the delivery of social housing should be consistent with housing need as identified in the annual Summary of Social Housing Assessments over the period, which will facilitate addressing this particular demographic need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700145#WRMMMM01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Adaptation Grant Funding","counter":4238,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700145#WRMMMM01300"},{"type":"question","counter":4239,"qnumday":1572,"qnumall":"[15912\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700145#WRMMMM01400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the grant funding for housing adaptations will be returned to 2010 levels; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4240,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the social benefit accruing from the suite of Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability, particularly in terms of\u00a0facilitating the continued independent living by older people and people with a disability in their own homes.\u00a0 This is also recognised in the Programme for a Partnership Government and as a consequence, funding for these schemes has been increased year on year since 2014 with the\u00a02017 funding allocation\u00a0of &euro;60.5m -\u00a0comprising &euro;48.8m Exchequer funding and &euro;12.1m from local authority resources - being an increase of some 6% on the previous year.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I have further increased the funding for the schemes in 2018 to a total of\u00a0&euro;66.25m.

The Task Force was requested to oversee and report on a number of initial steps, and to urgently consider any potential life safety issues and appropriate responses. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to establishing the Task Force, I requested that a number of immediate initial actions be taken. Local authorities were directed to undertake a review of fire safety in multi-storey social housing buildings and to also review fire safety in medium to high rise buildings in their functional areas. The Task Force was mandated to oversee and report on these initial actions as well as reviewing existing arrangements and systems for fire safety and related issues which impact on fire safety in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  This initial work in relation to both multi-storey social housing buildings and medium to high rise buildings has been carried out and all local authorities have reported back to my Department as requested. The Fire Safety Task Force established two sub-groups to review the returns received from local authorities. The returns indicate that multi-storey social housing buildings in Ireland are generally designed, built and equipped appropriately for domestic fire risk, although a number of fire safety issues were identified and followed up. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the review of medium to high rise buildings (greater than 6 stories or 18m high), more than 800 buildings were identified through the national survey undertaken. A number of these were identified as having external cladding which gave rise to concerns and in these cases building owners have been required by local authorities, using their powers under the Fire Services Acts, to undertake fire safety assessments. National guidance\u00a0on further actions in light of the results of these fire safety assessments, taking account of emerging information on the cladding issue from international sources, was prepared by the Task Force sub-group and a guidance note &ndash; \"Fire safety Guidance Note 01 of 2017 Assessing Existing Cladding Systems in Buildings of More than Six Storeys, or More than 18m in Height\" &ndash; was published by my Department in December 2017. The guidance note was circulated to fire authorities and placed on my Department&rsquo;s website as a support for those undertaking assessments of cladding in medium to high rise buildings.

There have been a number of national and local press advertising initiatives, as well as\u00a0targeted\u00a0online promotion, in an effort to ensure that property owners who can avail of the scheme are aware of the benefits.<\/p><p>By the end of 2017, a total of 820 applications had been received under the scheme. Local authorities were engaging with the property owners in relation to 573 properties, 31 agreements\u00a0for lease had been signed and 9 social housing\u00a0homes had been delivered and tenanted. A detailed breakdown of the RLS\u00a0scheme data\u00a0up to end\u00a0Q4 2017\u00a0is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <\/p><p>.<\/p><p>The nature of the RLS means that the period leading up to the signing of contracts, which entails sourcing and inspecting the properties, and negotiation with owners, is the slowest part of the process. All local authorities are active in sourcing and identifying potential properties and it is expected that significant numbers of contracts will be entered into once that process is complete. Once contracts are signed, delivery is estimated at between 2 and 6 months, a fraction of the time involved for\u00a0a capital acquisition or build project.<\/p><p>Feedback from local authorities indicates that, in many cases, properties requiring extensive repair work, and therefore not suitable\u00a0for the\u00a0RLS, have been secured under the Buy and Renew Scheme which facilitates local authorities or\u00a0AHBs to purchase vacant properties for social housing use. In addition, anecdotal evidence suggests that the levels of vacancy recorded as part of Census 2016 have significantly reduced in the interim, particularly in urban areas like Dublin where many\u00a0previously vacant\u00a0homes have since been occupied. <\/p><p>It is clear\u00a0that by the end of 2017, RLS had not yet delivered the level of new social housing homes envisaged. I reviewed the operation of the scheme, as part of the review of Rebuilding Ireland, and\u00a0concluded that the scheme has significant potential but there are areas where it can be improved to make it more attractive and effective. Accordingly, from 1 February 2018, a number of key changes\u00a0were made\u00a0to the scheme. These include:<\/p><p>- a reduction in the minimum lease term required from 10 to 5 years;<\/p><p>- increasing the proportion of market rent available to property owners where they take on more responsibilities under the tenancy, meaning that up to 92% of market rent will be available;\u00a0and<\/p><p>- provision of additional funding for property owners, over and above the current &euro;40,000 limit, where the dwelling is a bedsit type dwelling being brought into compliance with the Standards for Rented Houses Regulations and made available for social housing. <\/p><p>I am making &euro;32 million available for the scheme in 2018 and\u00a0I expect local authorities and\u00a0AHBs to continue to implement the scheme locally.<\/p><p>Over the period 2016 to 2021, the national target is for the delivery of an additional 50,000 social housing homes through Build, Acquisition and Leasing Schemes.\u00a0The ambition is for 33,500 of these homes to be delivered through new build programmes including Part V; for 6,500 to be delivered through Acquisition programmes including the Housing Agency Acquisition Programme; and for the remaining 10,000 homes to be delivered under a range of leasing initiatives including the RLS. It is expected that the RLS will deliver up to 3,500 homes over the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland, with a target of 800 to be delivered in 2018.<\/p><p>In January 2018, I asked all local authorities to provide a detailed report of their social housing delivery profiles out to 2021.

His part\u00a0n the insurrection and in the republican movement at the time is undoubtedly more than worthy of remembrance and commemoration.\u00a0 The immensely successful 1916 Commemorations that took place nationwide in the centenary year included the creation of permanent tributes to many of those who, like Commandant Mallin, had fought, and in his case died, during the Rising.<\/p>  <p>  Over a thousand national monuments are in State care under the National Monuments\u00a01930 - 2004, the vast majority of which are archaeological structures or features pre-dating the year 1700.\u00a0 This reflects the core focus of the\u00a0Acts on ancient archaeological remains rather than on buildings of a historic nature but of relatively much more recent origin. There is, of course, also the input of significant financial resources that is required to ensure the proper management and maintenance of these national monuments that are already in State care.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0decision for the\u00a0State to take action under the National Monuments Acts in relation to the buildings at Nos. 14 &ndash; 17 Moore Street, which might be seen as somewhat comparable to Emmet Hall,\u00a0was strongly influenced by the fact that these buildings had played a very direct,\u00a0distinct and significant role in the Rising itself. \u00a0One of the key and defining moments of the insurrection, the decision to surrender, happened\u00a0in No. 16 and, at one point, the buildings also accommodated several hundred insurgents who had escaped\u00a0from the GPO. Other factors in that\u00a0decision\u00a0were\u00a0that these\u00a0were also the most complete and original pre-1916 buildings on the street, that they contained physical evidence of the presence of the rebels in the form of the openings cut through the buildings as they made their way up Moore Street from their entry point at No. 10 and\u00a0that a particular opportunity had emerged for the State to gain ownership on an agreed basis in time for the 1916 Centenary\u00a0through the involvement of the National Asset Management Agency. <\/p>  <p>  Emmet Hall is\u00a0outside\u00a0the normal framework that would determine that\u00a0a individual\u00a0building constituted a national monument that\u00a0warranted a Preservation Order being placed on it under the National Monument Acts at this particular\u00a0time.\u00a0Such powers are intended to preserve monuments that are at grave and immediate risk of destruction\u00a0and were\u00a0primarily devised\u00a0to protect archaeological sites or ancient ruinous remains from being irreparably\u00a0 damaged. \u00a0The Moore Street buildings were\u00a0significantly run down and were at risk of being demolished to facilitate wider redevelopment proposals. Neither do the other special circumstances I have outlined in relation to\u00a0Moore Street apply to an equivalent extent\u00a0in relation\u00a0to Emmet Hall,\u00a0important\u00a0though it may be\u00a0in its own right.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I understand that a proposal to develop the rear of\u00a0Emmet Hall, which is still in use,\u00a0is currently the subject of an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and\u00a0it would not therefore be appropriate for me comment on that aspect of the case. I would, however, point to the Register of Protected Structures (RPS) as provided for\u00a0in the Planning and Development Acts which allows local authorities to consider the future of historic buildings, including those in\u00a0current use.\u00a0 Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by adding\u00a0particular structures on the RPS.\u00a0 Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them in order\u00a0to safeguard their future. The addition of a structure to the Record of Protected Structures is a reserved function of the members of the relevant planning authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700148#WRPPPP04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards Data","counter":4406,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700149#WRQQQQ00300"},{"type":"question","counter":4407,"qnumday":1637,"qnumall":"[15171\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700149#WRQQQQ00400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the details of all State board appointments since the general election in 2016; the person who recommended each appointment; the credentials of those appointed; if the vacancy was publicly advertised; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":4408,"content":"<p>I am advised that all appointments to State boards under the aegis of my Department since the General Election in 2016 are as set out in the following table.

Wild deer in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts. They roam freely throughout the countryside and are present in many parts of the country.

Ultimately, however, where deer species are increasing in range and numbers, depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats (especially woodland), culls need to be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.<\/p><p>The area referred to by the Deputy is a large tract of land incorporating both private property and state-owned National Park land. Control of deer on private property is the responsibility of landowners. Wild deer in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts, however, there is an annual open season during which deer can be legally shot under licence. <\/p><p>The open season for deer operates generally from 1 September to the last day of February, depending on the species and gender of deer. Landowners may also apply to my Department for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.  These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands.
