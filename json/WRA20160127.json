Under the 2009 Act, authorisations for intrusive surveillance are granted by a judge of the District Court on application by a superior officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners, the Defence Forces or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in the circumstances which are set out in the Act. <\/p>  <p>  However, I would point out that the 2009 Act was part of a series of measures which were a response to a number of difficulties being experienced where the investigation of serious offences was concerned and where the entire justice system was under serious threat.  At that time, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na required additional powers to investigate and prosecute organised criminal gangs and it was incumbent upon the legislature to introduce the additional powers set out in the Criminal Justice (Surveillance ) Act 2009.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to interception, the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 provides that an authorisation for interception may only be granted by Ministerial warrant on application from the Garda Commissioner, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces or the Chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and only for the purposes of the investigation of serious crime or protecting the security of the State as set out in the 1993 Act.<\/p>  <p>  I should emphasise that the provisions of both Acts are subject to independent judicial oversight by Judges of the High Court, designated by the Government for that purpose.

Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime.<\/p><p>Operation Thor delivers on increased investment in policing by this Government, and marks a significant step-up in the policing response to burglaries and related crime.  In particular, the Government has ended the moratorium on Garda recruitment, with 1,150 Garda&iacute; being recruited.  &euro;34 million has been invested in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming onstream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  This will ensure Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community.  The Government is also investing in airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems.<\/p><p>In addition, a further allocation, in excess of &euro;5 million, has being committed to support Operation Thor.  This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime is supporting a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.<\/p><p>While it will take some time to properly assess its impact on crime, the Garda authorities have reported very positive operational feedback since the launch of Operation Thor on 2 November.  This is underlined by a significant series of arrests in various locations around the country as part of planned Garda operations, as well as charges being brought against numerous individuals.  Operation Thor has led to the arrest of particular target suspects in relation to burglary, and arrests connected to crimes committed by mobile criminal groups, as well as handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.  Early operational feedback from the Garda authorities indicates that since its launch on 2 November, Operation Thor has made a significant impact on burglary rates with an estimated decrease in burglary of 34% when compared to the same period the previous year.  These figures will of course be subject to further analysis and verification by the CSO before the full official crime figures for 2015 are published. <\/p><p>The early successes under Operation Thor have been achieved by targeting key suspects, patrolling of crime 'hot spots' and creating a general public awareness of the need for crime prevention measures.  There has been concentrated Garda activity including 10,120 anti-crime patrols and 13,020 targeted checkpoints nationwide, with 550 burglary related arrests. <\/p><p>I should also emphasise that Operation Thor will be further backed up by the anti-burglary new legislation which I recently commenced.  The Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b><\/b>2015 is targeted at those repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.  The new legislation requires the District Court to provide for consecutive jail sentences where a burglar is being sentenced for multiple offences.  It also allows Courts to refuse bail for offenders who have a previous conviction for domestic burglary coupled with two or more pending charges.  I made the enactment of this new legislation a priority so that it would be available when persons charged as part of Operation Thor come before the courts and this commitment has also now been delivered upon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700068#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":13,"content":"<p>Question No. 9 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Paramilitary Groups","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700068#WRA01050"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[45028\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700068#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her efforts to combat criminality by paramilitary organisations in the Leinster and Ulster Border region, further to the agreement of A Fresh Start - The Stormont House Agreement and Implementation Plan; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Reserve members make a real and tangible contribution to the policing of communities right across the country and I am fully supportive of the continued development of the Reserve.  In particular, I welcome the recent conferring by the Commissioner of additional powers on reserve members under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and also her decision that reserve members should carry out additional duties including the serving of summonses, and the issuing of Fixed Charged Penalty Notices where offences are detected.  I also welcome the inclusion of a special stream for eligible reserve members in the 2016 recruitment campaign for full-time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

It is essential to address those concerns.<\/p><p>I decided to have an independent examination of the law carried out in respect of access by statutory bodies to the communications records of journalists held by communications service providers, taking into account, the principle of protection of journalistic sources, the need for statutory bodies with investigative and\/or prosecution powers to have access to data in order to prevent and detect serious crime, and current best international practice in this area.<\/p><p>The former Chief Justice, Judge John Murray, has agreed to carry out the review over the coming three months and he will bring recommendations to me.  I think it is important to have an independent aspect to the review in order to bolster public confidence in the process.  As I am sure the Deputy will understand, I would not wish to presuppose the outcome of Mr. Justice Murray's review in any respect.

In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.

This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles.  We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015.

The use and exchange of good intelligence is increasingly important in tackling organised crime and terrorism.  In this regard, as part of the major programme of investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan there will be considerable investment in Garda information and communications technology, including connecting to the Schengen Information System, that will support crime investigation and enhance intelligence-led policing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700069#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Misconduct Allegations","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700070#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[3039\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700070#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if it is acceptable that in the panel of a barrister's review of the case of a person (details supplied), the person was not interviewed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>The particular case to which the Deputies refer was amongst those considered under the mechanism established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which have been made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, or the Taoiseach with a view to determining to what extent and in what manner further action may be required in each case.

Crime trends are monitored by Garda management on an ongoing basis and the necessary crime prevention and investigation resources are allocated accordingly. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is investing heavily in those policing resources.  In particular, the Capital Plan 2016 - 2021 makes provision for the ongoing delivery of new Garda vehicles, as well as very significant investment in new technology and information systems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, amounting to an investment of &euro;205m over the life of the Plan.  In addition, the Government has ended the moratorium on Garda recruitment and Budget 2016 made provision for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; this year bringing to 1,150 the number of new Garda&iacute; who will have been recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014.<\/p>  <p>  It is unfortunately the case that gun crime has for some time been an inherent part of organised criminal activity in Ireland, as it is in other similar jurisdictions.  Garda&iacute; continue to tackle this type of crime through a range of targeted and intelligence based operations, often disrupting and preventing incidents, as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved.  Heavy penalties are provided for weapons offences in our criminal law and mandatory minimum penalties have been introduced for certain firearms offences. <\/p>  <p>  A series of strong legislative measures are also in place to underpin the State&rsquo;s response to organised crime and these are being fully utilised by the Garda&iacute;.  Ultimately, the only effective way to combat organised crime is by disrupting and prosecuting those involved in its operations, and especially the drugs trade which is at the heart of much of its profits.  Therefore substantial efforts by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Customs are devoted to damaging this activity, and to bringing those involved before the Courts.  In this regard any attempts to intimidate witnesses are taken extremely seriously and are fully investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with prosecutions being pursued where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The considerable powers already available to Garda&iacute; to tackle serious crime have been supplemented further by the establishment last year of a DNA Database which has the capacity to link suspects to unsolved crimes using forensic evidence, and will greatly assist Garda&iacute; in investigating a whole range serious offences.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these enforcement measures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also engage extensively with communities in a range of fora to address local concerns relating to crime and community safety, including the impact that organised crime can have at a community level.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to human trafficking, there are strong legislative, administrative and operational measures in place in Ireland to combat and prevent trafficking in human beings.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, with penalties of up to life imprisonment for human trafficking, greatly strengthened the law in this area and this legislation was further bolstered in 2013 with other forms of exploitation, including forced begging and forced criminal activities, being addressed in law. <\/p>  <p>  A dedicated Anti-Human Trafficking Unit was established in the Department of Justice and Equality with the purpose of ensuring that the State's response to human trafficking is coordinated and comprehensive.  A new National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Human Trafficking in Ireland is currently being finalised.  For a number of years An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in its Annual Policing Plan, has identified trafficking in human beings as one of its priorities with an increased focus given to prevention and detection of human trafficking.  Specific detailed training is provided to Gardai with over 900 participants in the in-depth training course developed jointly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), and which also incudes participants from the PSNI.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I can assure the Deputy that all crime trends continue to be monitored and I remain in close contact with the Commissioner to ensure that we do all we can in terms of keeping legislation under review and providing the necessary policing resources to confront crime in all  its forms and make our communities safer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700070#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700070#WRC01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Retirements","counter":83,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700070#WRC01050"},{"type":"question","counter":84,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[3293\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700070#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"her views on a submission (details supplied); if she will reply to the requests in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":85,"content":"<p>There have been no cases made against my Department or bodies reporting to my Department by civil servants who objected on age grounds to being retired when they reached age 65.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700070#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":86,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700070#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":87,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[3304\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700070#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied) in County Cork under the carer's allowance scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":88,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person concerned on 17 November 2015.

These may include a means test, payment of a certain number of PRSI contributions, and\/ or satisfying the Habitual Residence Test.  In all cases, decisions on individual cases are taken strictly on the basis of the evidence that the person does, or does not, satisfy the qualifying conditions.<\/p>  <p>  In view of this it is not possible to make general statements regarding any particular nationality.  In some cases, EU citizens will qualify for payment and in some cases they will not, depending on whether or not they satisfy the qualifying conditions of the particular scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the qualifying conditions for child benefit and most social assistance payments is the habitual residence condition (HRC).  Whether or not a person satisfies the HRC is assessed on the on the basis of objective considerations independent of nationality.  However, under EU law there are some exemptions for EU workers, for example, in relation to family benefits such as child benefit and family income supplement.  So workers from other EU countries (including Romania) would have more favourable treatment for these two payments than would people from outside the EEA.  To qualify for this, the person would have to have achieved the status of &ldquo;worker&rdquo;.  EU nationals who have never worked in Ireland do not have an automatic entitlement to any payment, but would have to satisfy the HRC and other conditions that apply to the relevant payment. <\/p>  <p>  There are some situations where a non-EU worker could qualify for a payment where an EU citizen would not.  These related mainly to contributory payments.  For example, if a person from outside the EU is living legally in Ireland and has worked and paid sufficient contributions here, he or she may qualify for illness benefit in the event of being off work due to illness (subject to also meeting all of the other qualifying conditions).  This would be regardless of nationality.  On the other hand, an EEA citizen (even an Irish citizen) who has not worked and therefore has not paid sufficient contributions cannot qualify for illness benefit if they are ill.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Department provides immediate and flexible assistance to people with insufficient means to meet their needs and those of their dependents through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme.  The HRC does not apply to exceptional needs payments (ENP) or urgent needs payments (UNP) administered under SWA as by their nature these payments may be required to meet an immediate, unforeseen and once-off need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700071#WRD00600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Eligibility","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700071#WRD00650"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[3376\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700071#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"to end discrimination of older women when applying for the State pension (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":105,"content":"<p>The State pension contributory is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  The home-maker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied. This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.  The scheme does not involve the award of credits.<\/p>  <p>  The 2007 Green Paper on Pensions estimated an annual cost of backdating the Home-maker's scheme, at that time, as &euro;150 million (if to 1973) or &euro;160 million (if to 1953).  However it described those estimates as &ldquo;extremely tentative&rdquo; due to a number of factors, e.g., the fact that the cost would include, not just people resident in the State, but also many others resident in other countries, such as the UK.  Given the cost that would be involved, the Green Paper did not propose that such backdating be introduced.  Backdating the scheme now, for existing pensioners, could be expected to be significantly more expensive because (a) there are some 50% more contributory State pensioners now than there were in 2007, (b) the rate of the pension has increased since 2007 by 11%, and (c) the current cohort of people reaching pension includes more women who have had a significant level of insurable employment and would therefore be in a position to benefit from the home-maker's scheme.  The cost would also be expected to increase each year in the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund.  For example, those with a yearly average of only 20 contributions (38% of the maximum) may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate.  The Review also examined the changes in the contribution rules and the associated rates of payment which were to be introduced in September 2012.  The Review found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories still obtain the best value from their contributions. <\/p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives may not qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700071#WRD00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700071#WRD00813"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[3377\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700071#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"to support a matter concerning invalidity pensions (details supplied) in Dublin 3; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":108,"content":"<p>Invalidity pension is one of a range of income supports available to those who are unable to work due to illness or incapacity.

It found low working hours can arise in different forms in employment contracts, such as regular part-time contracts with fixed hours or a contract with &ldquo;If and when&rdquo; hours only or a hybrid of the two.

I also understand that in the past number of weeks Italy submitted a number of potential cases for relocation to Ireland and these are currently being evaluated by officials in my Department. The small number of relocations effected to-date reflects the fact that the EU relocation programme has been slow in gathering momentum due to resource issues at migration 'hotspots' in Greece and Italy and the programme's low rate of uptake among those arriving in the EU via Italy and Greece.

The Family Resource Centre Programme is a national programme with its own dedicated budget. Tusla provides core funding to Family Resource Centres to cover the employment of two to three members of staff and some overhead costs. In 2015, Tusla provided &euro;13.09m in funding for the Family Resource Centre Programme.<\/p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres (FRCs) are front-line services rooted in the communities they serve.  Acting as a focal point within their communities, Family Resource Centres provide a holistic service of child, family and community support and advocacy to all children and families in their communities. While Family Resource Centres operate an open-door policy and provide many services and development opportunities at a universal level, they also proactively target specific cohorts within their communities.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla fully appreciates the role that Family Resource Centres play in offering early intervention support to families in difficulty. Tusla has advised that it intends to build on the strengths of the FRC Programme in the years ahead in meeting its mandate for community-based early intervention and family support.  The Agency recognises the benefits that additional funding can bring to an FRC. Tusla has also advised that it intends to review the funding and resource allocation model as it applies to Family Resource Centres this year. This review will take account of any significant resource pressures, should they arise.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I announced a significant increase in the funding allocation to Tusla for this year.

The self-harm rate, 200 per 100,000 of the population, was essentially unchanged from 2013.  This levelling off follows three successive decreases in the rate of persons presenting to hospital following self-harm from 2011 &ndash; 2013.  The only significant change in the rate of hospital-treated self-harm by age was among boys aged 10-14 years, where the self-harm rate increased by 44% from 34 to 49 per 100,000.  Since 2007, the male rate has increased significantly, by 14%, whereas the female rate is less than 1% higher than in 2007.<\/p><p>The HSE Mental Health Division has a multifaceted response to people at risk of self-harm or who have had a self-harm episode including referral by GP to Community Mental Health Teams for the appropriate service; liaison psychiatry services onsite in Model 3 and 4 and acute hospitals; a comprehensive mental health on-call service in Emergency Departments in the acute hospitals for people presenting in crisis during the on-call period; self-harm clinical specialist nurses in a number of Emergency Departments; the Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse (SCAN) Initiative by which GPs can refer directly to SCAN Nurses for assessment and advice on management of their patients who attend their surgeries with suicidal ideation. In each of these settings, a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment is carried out together with an assessment of mental state and a risk assessment for suicide. On the basis of this, a care plan is drawn up and the next steps depend on the psychosocial stresses identified together with the presence or absence of a mental illness such as depression.  <\/p><p>Community Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Mental Health teams are the first line of specialist mental health services for children and young people. There are currently 67 Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams and 3 liaison services nationally. The multidisciplinary team, under the clinical direction of a Consultant Child &amp;amp; Adolescent psychiatrist, includes junior medical staff, psychologists, social workers, nurses, speech &amp;amp; language therapist, occupational therapist and child care workers. The assessment and intervention provided by such teams is determined by the severity and complexity of the presenting problem(s).  This range of disciplines and skills offer a care and treatment package geared to individual needs.  <\/p><p>The upward trend in self-harm among young boys is concerning and highlights the on-going need for prevention and intervention programmes to be implemented at national level.In this regard, the HSE in its National Service Plan for 2016 commits to &ldquo;Develop early intervention and prevention services, in collaboration with primary care and NGO providers, to ensure that children and young people can access assessments and interventions, including access to counselling and psychology, at the appropriate stage to prevent and reduce escalation to secondary care mental health service and as recommended in <i>Healthy Ireland<\/i>and <i>Connecting for Life.<\/i>&quot; Funding is also being provided this year for the provision of three new Jigsaw youth mental health services  in Cork, Dublin and Limerick.<\/p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) helps to support a wide array of work in communities, in partnership with the voluntary sector, across the country that focus on promoting positive mental health and reducing suicide and self-harm by providing significant grant funding each year, as well as by assisting in coordinating and giving strategic direction to the work undertaken in this area. NOSP supports a range of services for teenagers and young people including Pieta House, SpunOut.ie ReachOut.com\/Inspire Ireland, BeLongTo.

This difficulty is being experienced by other English speaking countries including the UK, Australia, and Canada. Notwithstanding this, the HSE Census returns for the end of November 2015 show that we have over 880 more nurses employed in the public health services than a year ago.<\/p>  <p>  Recruitment of additional nurses is the subject of considerable ongoing activity by the HSE and voluntary hospitals. Recruitment campaigns are underway in Ireland and abroad. This includes recent and ongoing national and local interviewing of General Nurses, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability, Registered Children's Nurses and Midwives.<\/p>  <p>  A number of measures have been put in place to support recruitment of nurses from abroad. In 2015 the HSE  initiated a targeted international recruitment drive. This focused initially on Irish trained nurses who left for the UK during the moratorium and has now been expanded to countries further afield. It also facilitated seven adaptation programmes and made 405 places available to the nursing home sector for overseas nurses. Further adaptation courses are being provided in 2016 for nurses who are required to complete a course prior to registration. The NMBI have approved, on a pilot basis until June 2016, a new aptitude test with the RCSI as an alternative method to assess candidates for registration. Nurses are currently being advised of the availability of this test. The first theory test for 22 people took place on the 5 December 2015 with the practice tests on the 12\/13 December and repeats on the 7 January 2016. All candidates were successful between the 2 practical tests. Further tests are planned by RCSI in January, February and March, with 67 prospective nurses having expressed an interest in taking the test.<\/p>  <p>  Consideration of pay rates for fourth year student nurses undertaking the 36 week clinical placement and whether the placement should attract incremental credit was provided for in a Chairman's Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement. In the context of supporting recruitment and retention, the Department of Health and the HSE with the relevant nursing unions considered these issues at the Workplace Relations Commission  on 14 December, 2015.  Following further engagement between the relevant parties, a Joint Document encompassing proposals on the rate of pay for the placement and on granting incremental credit for the placement was finalised on 23 December.  The Joint Document was submitted to my Department for consideration. Any changes to the rate of pay and the treatment of the placement as regards incremental credit  will  also be subject to the approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  All of the measures mentioned above will facilitate the recruitment and retention of nursing staff at all grades and disciplines within the Irish health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700087#WRU00400","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Recruitment","counter":419,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700087#WRU00500"},{"type":"question","counter":420,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[3368\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012700087#WRU00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address matters (details supplied) regarding the health service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":421,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to ensuring that patients throughout the country continue to have access to GP services.

This review is taking place within the context of the Framework Agreement which was signed by the above named parties in June 2014 and the Memorandum of Understanding which was signed in February 2015. Among the many topics comprehended by this review process is the issue of supports for General Practice to ensure retention of doctors in remote rural and deprived urban areas.<\/p><p>The number of consultants has grown significantly in recent years to 2,725 WTEs.

This increase will help to address service needs and also progression of EWTD compliance, thereby improving the working conditions of doctors.<\/p><p>The ability of the HSE and the health service to attract and retain high quality frontline staff shapes the extent to which the HSE can maintain and develop the range of health services required.

Arising from this, the &euro;28m ERDF funding that was available to Ireland for the Urban Development Operational Programme for the 2007 &ndash; 2013 period was apportioned as follows&ndash;<\/p><p>- &euro;17m to the BMW region, and <\/p><p>- &euro;11m to the Southern and Eastern Region.<\/p><p>This larger share that was allocated to the BMW Region in that period allowed projects in both the gateways and hubs in the BMW region - as designated in the National Spatial Strategy 2002 &ndash; 2020 (NSS) - to be ERDF co-funded, with the Southern and Eastern Region being restricted to supporting projects in the designated gateways only.<\/p><p>In the new round for the 2014 - 2020 ERDF funding programme period, both Irish regions have been classified as &lsquo;more developed&rsquo;, and although the overall amount of ERDF funding available to Ireland under the Urban Development Operational Programme has increased to &euro;40m, the reclassification of the Northern and Western Region has had the effect of considerably reducing the share of funding available to that Region. Consequently, the &euro;40m total ERDF funding for urban projects in the 2013 &ndash; 2020 period has been apportioned as follows: <\/p><p>- &euro;14m to the Northern and Western Region, and<\/p><p>- &euro;26m to the Southern and Eastern Region.<\/p><p>In addition, during the negotiations on the new ERDF Operational Programmes, the European Commission stressed the need for the funding of larger scale projects and consequently suggested &ndash; having regard to the lower level of funding being provided to the Northern and Western Region - that only projects in cities and major urban centres should be eligible for funding in that Region.
