National Sports Campus Development Authority, to be noted.  Maples and Calder represent the plaintiff in this case, Dublin Waterworld Limited.  The committee examined an issue in 2011 and 2012 and reported on the matter.  This correspondence seeks the permission of the committee to waive privilege so as to allow the defendant to get access to certain categories of documents in accordance with a High Court order.  There are two categories of documents.  The first is correspondence to the committee that now forms the record of the committee.  All of this has been published on our website and all was given to the Department.  As these documents are already in the public domain, the advice is that no issues of privilege arise and the plaintiff can be notified.  The second category of documents relates to records maintained by the plaintiff of correspondence with individual members.  These are not matters for the committee but for the plaintiff.  The matter is covered in Part 10 of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013.  The Clerk will write to Maples and Calder and apprise them of the position.<\/p><p>No. 3B.4 is correspondence, dated 1 December 2015, from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, regarding the registration of nurses, to be noted.<\/p><p>No. 3B.5 is correspondence received from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, regarding Mr. Patrick Coughlan, to be noted.<\/p><p>Nos. 3C.1 to 3C.9 are briefing documents and opening statements for today&rsquo;s meeting, all to be published.<\/p><p>I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment on No. 4.1, which comprises the financial statements of the Institute of Technology, Tallaght.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#B00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449741600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>With regard to the Institute of Technology, Tallaght, this is a clear audit opinion but I draw attention to the fact it did not carry out a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control, which is a specific requirement in the code of governance for institutes of technology.

The background to this is that F&aacute;ilte Ireland does not recognise a deferred pension funding asset for one of three defined pension schemes it operates.  Its argument for this is that it has not been provided with a guarantee in regard to the future liabilities of that scheme.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland recognises there is a liability that will have to be met, which, I understand, is of the order of &euro;240 million in total.  That is the body's estimate of benefits already accrued.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is recognising that the State will provide it with funding to meet some but not all of that liability.  It recognises some &euro;100 million of future funding as an asset on its balance sheet, which leaves it with a net liabilities position on the balance sheet of &euro;100 million.<\/p> <p>  In most semi-State bodies, there is full recognition that the State will meet liabilities as they arise in the future and, on that basis, the full value of the asset is recognised.  That would change the look of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's balance sheet, putting it in a net assets position, as at 31 December 2014, of approximately &euro;42 million instead of that net liability.  It would also have an impact on its income and expenditure account whereby it would be showing a surplus of &euro;6 million for the year instead of a surplus of &euro;4.2 million.  Prior to its financial statements for 2013, F&aacute;ilte Ireland did recognise that asset, but the board has decided this is a more appropriate way to account for it.<\/p> <p>  I am giving a qualified-audit opinion on this matter.  The practice of operating pay-as-you-go pension schemes has an implicit, as opposed to an explicit, commitment.  There is also the fact that the employees of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and many other State bodies are paying contributions into a pension scheme in the expectation they will receive benefits in the future.  The Department and the Minister have the difficulty that the funding for F&aacute;ilte Ireland comes by way of Estimate, which is voted every year by the D&aacute;il.  The Minister cannot bind the D&aacute;il to a commitment in this regard, which presents a technical difficulty.  However, there is no evidence the Department would seek to avoid meeting those commitments as they arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#C01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1449741600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>We will note all that is contained in No. 4.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#C01400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1449741600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I wish to raise something I should, perhaps, have raised under correspondence or the lack thereof, which is the case of Mr. Douglas Fannin.

I have already spoken to the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of information that has been given to me from a former employee of the Central Bank.  This employee was tasked with carrying out a review of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The Central Bank had been found not to be in compliance with those measures previously.  The Comptroller and Auditor General had correspondence with it in that regard.<\/p> <p>  This individual joined the Central Bank in July 2014 to cover what was a temporary promotion but which subsequently transformed into a permanent promotion within the internal audit unit.  Between August and September 2014 this person carried out the field work in respect of the audit task in question and in October 2014 produced a draft report, of which I have a copy.  In the course of November there were discussions on the draft report and it is the strong view of the whistleblower that they were encouraged or instructed to omit, delete and amend certain findings within the draft.  The individual was so concerned that they made a protected disclosure on 17 November 2014 to Professor Patrick Honohan, the then Governor of the Central Bank.  The whistleblower had no further involvement in respect of completing this audit report.  He was tasked with other duties.<\/p> <p>  In December 2014, Deloitte was invited to carry out an assessment of what had happened.  I also have a copy of that assessment.  Deloitte acknowledges that the whistleblower had resisted amending, deleting and omitting elements of the findings, however Deloitte found that, in its view, the actions of management in respect of the report may have been appropriate and in keeping.  I am trying to mimic the language it uses, because its language in the report is somewhat conditional.  On 21 December, the whistleblower was informed of the decision of Deloitte and on 23 December they were informed that their contract was coming to an end.  The person concerned has a live unfair dismissal action within the system, so we must respect that procedure.  Finally, on 29 January, the final audit report was produced, and I have it with me.  It does not bear the name of the whistleblower anywhere on it, even though they had been involved throughout the process.<\/p> <p>  The reason I raise this, and the reason I approached the Comptroller and Auditor General, is that three very important issues arise.  The first is the behaviour within the audit division of the Central Bank and the practice of asking, encouraging or attempting to coerce people - who is to say? - into removing, altering or amending findings in an audit report.  The whistleblower concerned consulted with their professional body to establish, to the best of their ability, what their professional responsibilities were.  I have seen that correspondence also.<\/p><p>An issue arises in this regard.  <\/p><p> The second issue is the treatment of the whistleblower and the question that arises in my mind is was the whistleblower punished for speaking out, and for not going with the flow?  That is an important question.  <\/p><p> Finally, in the longer term the issue for this committee relates to the finalised internal audit report which the Central Bank issued on 29 January 2015 and which was distributed to the then Governor, Patrick Honohan, the deputy governors, the chair of the audit committee and the chair of the risk committee.  It does not make for very good reading.  It shows that the Central Bank, as at 29 January 2015, is not compliant with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  As I cast my eye down the document I see the results as follows: in terms of composition of board and code of ethics, it is partially compliant and on remuneration or pay it is partially compliant.  We know there was a recent controversy around retention payments, or bonuses or whatever they are called, within the Central Bank.  In terms of risk management accountability internal control, it is partially compliant; on procurement it is partially compliant; on travel it is compliant - the only such case on the list; in terms of disposal of State assets and access to assets by third parties, it is non-compliant; and on tax compliance it is partially compliant.<\/p><p> That is a very troubling account of the level of compliance of the Central Bank and in saying this it is not to adopt a fetish around the precision of audits or to argue over technicalities.  The reason I believe this report is troubling is that a lack of regulation, oversight, sloppiness and groupthink were all ingredients which led us to a catastrophic situation, not so much for the banks but for citizens, taxpayers and so on.  We can all in this committee room recall that time.  I have this document because it came in the package of documentation given to me by the whistleblower as a protected disclosure.  I emphasise that I have not been given anything that carries commercial sensitivity or that relates to another institution supervised or regulated by the Central Bank.<\/p><p> The question is what we are to do about this.  I raised this matter yesterday with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  My view is that there is a need for some serious questions to be answered in respect of practices within the audit division and in respect of the culture and the atmosphere within it.  That it would be considered, in any way, shape or form, good practice to lean on somebody to take findings out of a draft report smacks of the worst of the bad practice of the old days.  There are questions around the whistleblower, not including the unfair dismissal issue, which is separate.  Was the whistleblower punished?  Is that what happens within the Central Bank?  I would like to know.  <\/p><p> Finally, and perhaps most important, we need answers as to why, at 29 January 2015, there is a litany of non-compliance on the part of the Central Bank.  We have a right to expect best practice from the Central Bank and I do not think it is an outlandish thing to look for.  This is an internal document as audits, by their nature, tend to be but good practice and compliance within the Central Bank are not a private matter.  They are a matter of the utmost public concern and we need to find a mechanism through which we can investigate it.  I suggest the committee seek a copy of the internal report of 29 January and seek an opportunity to question the Central Bank on these matters.  There are obvious issues for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and I do not know if he has had sight of this document.  If he has, I would like to know his response to it and what he proposes to do about it.  If he has not seen it, I would like to know why.  I am conscious that I have documentation which other committee members do not have so I will seek advice as to whether I can share the information with members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#D03300","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449741600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Deputy McDonald has the information and we do not.

In light of what the Deputy has raised, I would like to find a process or a mechanism whereby we could get to the bottom of some of the issues which might be relevant to us in terms of audit but we will have to take some advice on it.

The origination of the internal audit work probably goes back to an issue we raised in a 2013 management letter to the Central Bank.  There was an ongoing issue with holding the Central Bank to account in relation to things like procurement so we made a recommendation that they carry out a comprehensive review of the extent to which they were compliant with the code of practice.  This is possibly the first instalment of a programmed review relating to four main areas: the operation and construction of the board of directors; code of conduct and ethics; remuneration; risk management accountability; and internal control and internal audit.  There were specific procedures to be followed by State bodies on procurement, travel, disposal of State assets and access to assets by third parties, as well as tax compliance.  We suggested that to the Central Bank and it undertook this work in 2014.  We received a copy of the results of the internal audit in March 2015, around the time we were completing the audit of the 2014 financial statements.  It was an exercise the Central Bank needed to do and actions arising from the audit needed to be followed up fairly promptly.  When we audit the 2015 financial statements we will revisit the matter to see what action has been taken on the recommendations of the internal audit and what progress has been made in investigating other aspects of the code of practice.<\/p> <p>  The statement on internal financial control is at the front of the financial statements.<\/p><p>It includes a reference to the applicability or otherwise of the code of practice.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>The European treaties ... provide that the Central Bank of Ireland is independent of the Government and so Government decisions, codes of practice and circulars do not apply directly to the bank.  However, the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies is largely applied by the Bank.  In accordance with the Central Bank Acts 1942 to 2014, remuneration of Bank staff is set by the Commission.  The Bank is guided by Government policy on staff remuneration.<\/blockquote><p>In the statement on internal financial control, the bank also disclosed that:<\/p><blockquote>During 2014, expenditure of &euro;4 million ... approximately 4% ... of the Bank&rsquo;s committed spend, was incurred across 42 contracts without recourse to a public procurement tender process.  Of the 42 contracts ... 28 have been regularised during the year, and there is an action plan in place to address the remaining 14 contracts.<\/blockquote><p>Where significant weaknesses in control are disclosed, there is a requirement for the Central Bank to include them in the statement on internal financial control.  We will come back to it.  The audit was informed that there was a whistleblower event in 2014 and we will investigate the matter further in the audit of the 2015 financial statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449741600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McDonald for raising the issue.  I do not know if we are being told it is outside our remit, which we are used to hearing about anything that is particularly awkward.

More recently, a whistleblower challenged the Central Bank's stress test system and suggested it was not all it appeared to be.  In the case of Eugene McErlean, the Central Bank was subsequently found to be wrong.  When Matthew Elderfield came before the committee we asked him questions about the second whistleblower.  He was more than reluctant to answer any questions and left an unsatisfactory situation in which we never got to the bottom of why the whistleblower had found the Central Bank a very cold climate in which to blow the whistle.  We never found out what happened to the whistleblower.  It was unsatisfactory.  Now we have another case.  We cannot accept that it is outside our remit.

This is the first cut at dealing with the issues, which is welcome.  During the process, it transpired that an auditor within the Central Bank had fallen foul of the process.  Nobody disputes the fact that the person resisted removing, amending or omitting elements of his or her work from the report.  Deloitte judged whether management was justified in it.  It is worrying in itself.  It came late to the process, and the controversy emerged during the process.  The real question is whether the whistleblower was punished, directly or indirectly, as a result of the position he or she took in carrying out his or her professional duties.  It is a fundamental question that must be answered.  The whistleblower believes he or she was punished for resisting the removal, omission or amendment of findings from the report.  Although I cannot definitively prove it is true, there is a body of documentation that echoes the whistleblower's concerns.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ross has hit the nail on the head regarding the pattern around whistleblowers.  The big brick wall seems to be that while one can ask the questions, one has no right to any answer or any form of reasonable transparency from the Central Bank.  The Central Bank is independent, for very good reasons, as set out in the treaties as part of the euro system.  However, these are matters of internal governance, best practice and decent standards.  It is unacceptable that Members of the Oireachtas cannot ask questions and get answers on simple compliance issues such as this.  If it is no big deal, if everything is okay and there is nothing for any of us to be concerned about, there should be no difficulty with the Central Bank providing its final report to the committee and providing representatives to talk to us about the process and explain why, in this tranche of the investigation, the results are partially compliant, partially compliant, partially compliant, compliant in one case, non-compliant and partially compliant.<\/p><p>That is not good enough.

The audit was completed in June of this year.  Delays in the production of audited financial statements have also occurred in previous years, related in part to a complex set of issues affecting the institute, which the committee has previously examined.  Unusually among the institutes of technology, Waterford Institute of Technology set up a number of companies in the 1990s to provide a range of ancillary services such as student accommodation, catering, sporting and recreation activities and retail outlets.  These companies are grouped as Diverse Campus Services Limited.  The scale of operation of the companies expanded over time and they undertook a number of major capital projects.  Diverse Campus Services receives substantial block funding each year from the institute.  A note to the institute&rsquo;s financial statements gives summary information about the companies&rsquo; operations, but their results are not consolidated with those of the institute.  Based on the nature and pattern of interaction between the institute and the companies, we concluded they are part of the normal services typically provided on the campuses of third level institutions and they should be included in consolidated accounts produced by the institute.<\/p> <p>  In November 2012, the Minister for Education and Skills commissioned Mr. Dermot Quigley to undertake a statutory inspection to review the relationship between the institute and the companies.  His report was published in July 2013.  He recommended that the companies should be restructured as subsidiaries of the institute and that the institute should then produce consolidated financial statements for the group.  This process has been ongoing.  The income and expenditure account shows the institute had income of &euro;84.7 million in 2012-13.  Expenditure for the year amounted to just under &euro;85 million, including a transfer of &euro;3.3 million to Diverse Campus Services.  This left the institute with an operating deficit of approximately &euro;300,000 for the year.  Note 26 to the financial statements acknowledges that the institute has incurred operating deficits for three consecutive years and discloses the rationale for the governing body&rsquo;s belief that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.  I have drawn attention to this note in the audit certificate.<\/p> <p>  The audit certificate also draws attention to three disclosures about governance issues included in the statement on internal control, relating to non-compliance by the institute with the code of governance of Irish institutes of technology.  First, the governing body did not carry out a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the system of internal controls in respect of the year of accounts, as it is required to do.  Second, the institute&rsquo;s audit committee did not issue an annual report to the governing body until September 2014 due to the committee&rsquo;s concerns about the timely provision to it of key information.  Finally, there were four areas of expenditure with a total value of &euro;524,000 where public procurement rules were not complied with.  As a consequence of delays experienced on the 2012-13 audit, we were unable to commence fieldwork in respect of the 2013-14 financial statements until July of this year.  The institute is carrying out some additional analysis in relation to issues raised during the audit and has indicated that it expects to respond to the audit queries early in 2016.  Assuming we are satisfied with the responses, I hope the financial statements can be certified before Easter.  I expect they will reflect full consolidation of the Diverse Campus Services companies.<\/p> <p>  The consolidated income and expenditure account for Cork Institute of Technology for the 2013-14 year shows an operating deficit of &euro;126,000 for the year ended 31 August 2014.  This compares to a surplus of over &euro;1.4 million in the previous year.  The institute&rsquo;s income for the 2013-14 financial year was &euro;98.6 million.  The institute incurred expenditure of &euro;98.7 million in the year, with staff costs accounting for &euro;64.2 million or 65% of the total.  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the 2013-14 financial statements.  In March 2014, my office received anonymous correspondence containing a large number of allegations in regard to Cork Institute of Technology.  Similar correspondence was received by the Committee of Public Accounts at that time.  In view of the breadth of the allegations, my office sent a copy of the correspondence to the chairman of the governing body of Cork Institute of Technology, rather than to the president, who is the accountable person.  We sent copies of the correspondence to the president of the institute, the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority.  We asked to be kept informed about the actions proposed to investigate the allegations.  Following a tender process, the institute appointed KPMG in October 2014 to investigate the allegations.  We were informed by the institute in December 2014 that the investigation had been completed and that a full detailed report would issue in due course.<\/p> <p>  On 22 December 2014, my office received additional correspondence, apparently from the same anonymous source.  This contained further allegations and repeated some of the allegations raised in the March 2014 correspondence.  We sent a copy of the new correspondence to Cork Institute of Technology, the Department and the Higher Education Authority.  On 2 April 2015, we received a letter from the chairman of the institute&rsquo;s governing body indicating that the audit committee had finalised its review of the allegations made in the anonymous correspondence and of KPMG&rsquo;s findings from its investigations.  The letter enclosed a copy of KPMG&rsquo;s report.  KPMG counted a total of 196 allegations made in the two sets of correspondence.  It concluded that 66 allegations were repetition of other allegations, 33 allegations did not contain sufficient information to allow investigation and the remaining 97 allegations had been adequately addressed by explanations and documentary evidence provided by the institute.  KPMG reported that it had found no evidence of wrongdoing in relation to the allegations but it did identify a small number of control improvement opportunities in regard to three of them.<\/p> <p>  While carrying out the audit of Cork Institute of Technology&rsquo;s 2013-14 financial statements, my office assessed the appropriateness of the institute&rsquo;s response to the allegations made and reviewed KPMG's report and findings.  We concluded that the institute's response to the allegations was prompt.  We were satisfied that the investigation carried out by KPMG was appropriate and adequate.  We saw no reason to disagree with the conclusions it reached.  We concluded that the control weaknesses identified by KPMG in its review of three of the allegations were in the nature of management point letters, which we are following up during the audit of the 2014-15 financial statements.  I concluded that there was no requirement for me to report formally to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in regard to the issues raised in the anonymous correspondence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#H01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449741600,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to make this statement concerning the 2013 financial statements of Waterford Institute of Technology and the 2014 financial statements of Cork Institute of Technology.  I have already forwarded some advance briefing to the committee and will therefore keep this opening statement short.  I assure the committee that the governance and accountability of the higher education institutions is an important matter for the Department and the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  The Department, with the co-operation of the HEA, is committed to ensuring appropriate and efficient structures are in place to allow for a system of good accountability in the sector.  I have set out in the background note the measures under way to enhance the system in place.<\/p> <p>  I would like to mention in particular, the Department&rsquo;s intention, in conjunction with the HEA, to commence a series of corporate governance compliance reviews utilising a centralised procurement framework to deliver reviews which will evaluate the effectiveness of governance in organisations against stated policy, best practice, national and international standards.  The review process may focus on a specific aspect or area of governance or may be broader in scope.  The Department has recently agreed with the HEA that the first rolling review, so-called, of governance compliance will be on procurement and will look at practices across the third level sector.  The terms of reference have been finalised, with the review expected to be undertaken in the first quarter of 2016.<\/p> <p>  On Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, as the committee is aware, the Minister took the exceptional step to initiate a statutory inspection into the relationship between Waterford Institute of Technology and companies providing campus services to it in November 2012.  The HEA had been liaising with WIT since 2011 in an effort to regularise the relationship between the institute and the companies concerned.  The process was quite complex, especially given the financial arrangements in place and the imminent liabilities relating to the Manor Village student accommodation development and the Carriganore complex.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Quigley provided his report to the Minister in June 2013.  He concluded that while the arrangements were well motivated, they were not appropriate and he recommended a reactivation of the process to acquire and restructure the companies as full subsidiaries of the institute.  He also recommended that the institute proceed with a buy-out of the Manor Village development and the completion of the Carriganore sports complex.  A full overview of the report&rsquo;s recommendations has been provided to the committee in briefing material.  The Department would like to acknowledge the positive engagement shown by both the institute and the companies during this inspection process, and the acceptance of and the speedy implementation of Mr. Quigley&rsquo;s recommendations.  This consolidation process is now complete and the Department is arranging for Mr. Quigley to review current arrangements with a view to reporting to the Minister in the spring.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that the committee has taken a particular interest in the current status of the Carriganore sports complex in WIT.  As the committee is aware, the project commenced in January 2012, and significant work was completed on it during the year.  In parallel, the institute was working towards a regularisation of its relationship with the companies.  As the institute was not in a position to access borrowings, other sources of finance were put in place to bring the development to a safe and protected state in early 2013.  As noted by Mr. Quigley, this resulted in &ldquo;major financial headaches from both DCS and WIT&rdquo;.  To protect the investment already made, Mr. Quigley recommended the completion of the Carriganore development and that moneys should be made available to the institute, either through a borrowing facility or Department funding, to do this.  In response, the Department initially committed &euro;2.5 million to provide for the completion of the project.  This was communicated to the committee previously.  There has been an extensive interaction between the Department and WIT since then in an effort to assist WIT in ensuring a final resolution of the issues which were the subject of Mr. Quigley&rsquo;s report.  This engagement has been intensified in recent months as the tender competition for the project drew to a close and complete clarity was finally brought to the costs involved.<\/p> <p>  In that context, my officials wrote to WIT on 8 October seeking some final documentation on 27 November last to confirm our proposal to provide an additional &euro;2.1 million to enable the completion of the sports complex and to finalise the implementation of the recommendations set out by Mr. Quigley in his report.  Following WIT&rsquo;s acceptance of the proposal, the Minister announced the additional funding on 1 December.  The funding brings the Department&rsquo;s total outlay towards both the purchase of the Manor Village student accommodation development and the completion of the sports complex to &euro;12.1 million.  This positive engagement will culminate in the completion of a valuable project for Waterford IT.  Cognisant of the benefits to all stakeholders involved in the Carriganore sports complex and the financial situation of the institute, the complex will become a fully functional facility which will benefit the staff and students of WIT as well as the wider local community.<\/p> <p>  On the anonymous correspondence on a number of issues in Cork Institute of Technology, the committee is aware that KPMG has undertaken a review of the allegations.  The report on the first set of allegations involved a review of the 175 allegations identified within the anonymous correspondence.  KPMG also provided a detailed report on the 21 allegations contained in the second anonymous letter.  Both consultant's reports have been submitted to the HEA and they have found no evidence to support the main thrust of the allegations.  The HEA followed up with CIT in respect of some minor issues that arose during the review and these matters have since been addressed.  The HEA has confirmed to the Department that, based on the KPMG reports and supporting information supplied by CIT, it is satisfied with the process implemented by CIT in investigating the allegations.  I am happy to answer questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449741600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I will focus on two issues, the Carriganore project in Waterford Institute of Technology and the anonymous allegations relating to Cork Institute of Technology.  In regard to Waterford Institute of Technology, the HEA notes Mr. Eugene McKenna&rsquo;s correspondence to the committee on 10 October 2015.  The HEA was aware of the potential consequences of the institute not proceeding with the Carriganore project, but there was no legitimate funding route available to allow the project to continue.  WIT has no power to borrow either directly or through letters of comfort or guarantee.  The proposal from DCS was therefore <i>ultra vires <\/i>the institute.  There are no circumstances whatsoever in which the HEA could condone such actions.<br\/><br\/>In July 2012, the project was over 60% complete, with works to the value of &euro;6.5 million completed on site.  There were, however, no funds available to progress the project without borrowings, and the development committee was forced to terminate the contract.  The HEA was aware that it is not good practice to terminate the employment of a contractor prior to the completion of a contract.  Unfortunately, no other options existed as the project had not been procured in accordance with public procurement guidelines or the capital works management framework, and a moratorium on new capital projects in the higher education sector was introduced in November 2011 which prevented any capital grants being issued to support completion.<br\/><br\/>The HEA raised concerns regarding the relationship between the institute, the development committee and its associated subsidiary companies as far back as January 2011.  The governing body was also known to be considering the relationship.  On 14 October 2011, the HEA wrote to Mr. Tony McFeely, then acting president, and sought details of outcomes of discussions at governing body level and requested that the institute put in place a team of appropriately qualified personnel to examine these and related issues and report back to the governing body.<br\/><br\/>While this examination was progressing, the acting president of WIT, Mr. Tony McFeely, provided a so-called letter of comfort to the development committee regarding the funding of phase 3 at Carriganore.  A report on the governance relationships did not issue until June 2012 and the governing body adopted the report and approved the implementation of the preferred option &ldquo;to revise the structure of the development committee and Campus Services and make them subsidiary undertakings of WIT under new management arrangements&rdquo;.  Numerous challenges faced the institute regarding the consolidation and transfer of significant debts and future liabilities onto its balance sheet.<br\/><br\/>On 13 November 2012, the Minister for Education and Skills appointed Mr. Dermot Quigley as inspector to carry out, pursuant to section 20 of the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006, a statutory inspection of companies providing a range of services in WIT.  The report produced confirmed the relationships between WIT, DCS and the subsidiary companies were inappropriate.  Fundamentally, the institute was wrong in providing letters of comfort to support borrowings for the Carriganore development.<br\/><br\/><font color=\"#FF0000\">  <\/font>In terms of Cork Institute of Technology, as the committee is aware, in March 2014 the Comptroller and Auditor General received anonymous correspondence containing a significant number of allegations in respect of CIT.  The correspondence was subsequently forwarded to both CIT and the HEA.  In late December 2014, a further set of anonymous allegations relating to CIT was received.  CIT commissioned an independent firm of auditors, KPMG, to review and report on both sets of allegations.  The HEA notes that KPMG carried out a detailed and thorough investigation of these allegations and that only minor matters of clarification were required.  The HEA further notes that CIT&rsquo;s audit committee was satisfied that the matters had been diligently and appropriately investigated.<br\/><br\/>During the review process the HEA remained in close contact with CIT.  It also had the opportunity to review the allegations as well as the KPMG findings and has itself sought additional information or clarification as required from CIT.<\/p><p>This information was provided to the HEA in a comprehensive and timely manner.  The HEA is satisfied that a detailed and thorough investigation was carried out by CIT and its auditors, with the auditors identifying no significant issues arising.<\/p><p> In circumstances such as these, it is vital that higher education institutions have processes in place to carry out comprehensive and independent investigations.  This is because it is institutions and, in particular, their governing bodies that are primarily responsible for the management and operation of their internal affairs.  In the context of dealing with specific allegations, institutions are expected to comply with the provisions of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and have procedures in place whereby employees may in confidence raise any concern about possible irregularities in financial, operational or other matters.  Indeed, confirmation that such procedures are in place is now a requirement of annual governance reporting arrangements to the HEA.  The 2014 Act also provides for disclosures relating to higher education matters to be made to me in my position as chief executive of the HEA.<\/p><p> I am happy to take whatever questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449741600,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to update the committee regarding matters raised at previous meetings and issues reported in the financial statement of the institute for the year ending 31 August 2013.  The briefing document supplied to the committee last week presents a detailed response to the various matters reported in the 2013 financial statements.<\/p> <p>  I propose in my opening statement to concentrate on two major issues that have been the subject of considerable comment at recent meetings of the committee.  These are progress in respect of the relationship between Waterford Institute of Technology and Diverse Campus Services Limited, DCS, including on the implementation of the recommendations of the Quigley report, and the status of the Carriganore sports campus development.  I will make particular reference to the contents of three separate but related reports, those being, Special Report No. 78 of the Comptroller and Auditor General: Matters Arising out of Educational Audits, which was issued in February 2012; the Grant Thornton report published in June 2012 on behalf of the governing body of the institute; and the Quigley report, which was issued in June 2013 to the Minister for Education and Skills.  These reports focused on the relationship between WIT and DCS, the company providing canteen and other services on campus.<\/p> <p>  Briefly, report No. 78 reads, \"The patterns of interaction between WIT and a range of companies that provide services (canteen, residences, recreation facilities, retail outlet and sports hall) on campus suggest that the related activities are part of the normal services typically provided on the campuses of third level institutions and that they should be included in consolidated accounts produced by the Institute.\"  WIT accepted and agreed with this recommendation.  Indeed, at the time of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, WIT's governing body had already commenced a review of WIT and DCS's relationship and commissioned a report from Grant Thornton.  The Grant Thornton report was presented to the governing body in June 2012 and recommended that DCS and its subsidiary companies should be restructured under new management as subsidiary companies of WIT.  The institute also accepted the recommendations included in the above reports and set about incorporating the DCS companies within WIT and consolidating their accounts within the WIT accounts.<\/p> <p>  This was overtaken by the appointment in November 2012 of Mr. Dermot Quigley by the Minister for Education and Skills as an inspector under section 20 of the Institutes of Technology Acts to review the relationship between WIT and these companies.  The institute welcomed Mr. Quigley's recommendations, which were published in June 2013.  His report points to aspects of the relationship between WIT and DCS that could be considered \"inappropriate\" in so far as they \"had adverse effects on governance at the Institute and on the management of its financial affairs\".<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to report that the institute has addressed the key issues raised in Special Report No. 78.  The institute has also implemented the recommendations of the Quigley report and full details of their implementation are contained in the briefing documentation supplied to the committee.  Specifically, the governance and internal control environments in the DCS group have been addressed.  The DCS board has been reconfigured with appointments of representatives from the governing body, institute staff and an external chair.  The code of governance for the institutes of technology has been implemented by DCS as far as is practical.  These new structures reinforce the alignment of the vision and purpose of the DCS companies with the institutional strategy and the needs of the student community.  The process of ensuring that alignment into the future is ongoing.  The consolidation of the financial accounts of DCS and WIT has been completed within the 2014 financial statements, which are under audit, as mentioned in the briefing documentation.<\/p> <p>  I will turn my attention to the status of the Carriganore sports complex development.  The key factors that led to the failure to complete the complex were the overdependence of DCS on financial support from WIT, DCS's increasing loan repayments and falling revenue, and the impact of the economic downturn on the institute's financial position.  It would have been logical for DCS and WIT to re-evaluate the economic viability of phase 3 of Carriganore, in particular given that phases 1 and 2 entailed an integrated building that did not require phase 3.  The sensible conclusion would have been not to have proceeded with phase 3 of the sports complex.  This point was noted by Mr. Quigley, who stated it was unfortunate that a decision was made to continue with this phase.<\/p> <p>  The commencement of phase 3 created major pressure on the institute&rsquo;s resources.  Notwithstanding its decreasing financial resources, the institute made every effort to support the continued development of Carriganore, specifically through the transfer of &euro;6.1 million from the institute to DCS during 2012.  By the end of 2012, however, WIT and DCS did not have access to additional financial resources to invest in the sports campus.  In addition, WIT's end-of-year accounts were showing a financial deficit.  The institute was forced to terminate works on the complex and secure an unfinished building.  This resulted in a cost for exiting the project and inevitably a cost for restarting the project at a later stage.<\/p> <p>  Following the Quigley report, the Department of Education and Skills made some funds available to the institute.  These were sufficient to pay the outstanding costs for the Manor Village student accommodation complex, which was another DCS project.  However, the residue was not sufficient to cover the cost of reopening and completing phase 3 of Carriganore.<\/p> <p>  I was appointed president in April 2015.  Since then, I have focused on ensuring sufficient funds are available to complete and open the sports complex.  Following further engagement with the Department of Education and Skills, sufficient funds have been made available to complete the building.  I am pleased that a sustainable repayment schedule for all moneys due to the Department is in place.  I am also engaging with the HEA in developing a three-year strategy to restore the institute's financial independence on an ongoing sustainable basis and to focus our resources on the continued education and economic development of the south east.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the consolidation of companies and associated matters, the institute has responded fully to the concerns raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in Special Report No. 78 and has implemented the majority of the recommendations of the Quigley report.  The future strategic development of DCS is aligned with the institute's strategic priorities.  The company's financial and governance structures are also aligned with best practice.  The role of the governing body from a governance, oversight and reporting perspective in respect of the subsidiaries is clear.  All projects now have a robust and sustainable financial plan in place that will realise significant assets for the institute, the region of Waterford and the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Willie Donnelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449741600,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for its invitation to attend this meeting on the financial statements of Cork Institute of Technology for 2014.  CIT is one of the largest, most progressive and most successful institutes of technology in the country, with 11,000 higher education students, approximately 3,000 craft and junior music students and a staff of 1,400.  It operates on four major sites in Cork city and county.  CIT is institute of technology of the year for 2016, our third time in the past decade, and in partnership with IT Tralee, it has successfully completed three of the four stages of technological university designation.<\/p> <p>  The quality of CIT's education programmes and research are overseen by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, and its governance is provided by its governing body and through its three committees, namely, audit, finance and strategic development.<\/p><p>It operates under the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006 and the Higher Education Authority has a regulatory oversight of CIT.  Higher education in Ireland has been operating in a challenging financial environment since 2008 with a significant increase in higher education student numbers, reduced staff numbers and reduced State funding.  Even though CIT continued to be successful in this period, it is not immune to these financial challenges, as may be seen in our 2014 financial statements.  We anticipate no immediate improvement in our financial situation in 2015 with a continuing reduction in State funding, increasing pay costs and a continuing need to dip into our relatively small reserves for essential maintenance and health and safety works.<\/p><p> The results of the Comptroller and Auditor General audit in 2014 complements the result of our internal audit reports.  Any issues raised in these audit reports are carefully considered by the governing body, its audit committee and the executive.  They are then followed up and corrected.  Controls are strengthened and they are monitored by the audit committee.  As in any institution, mistakes are made, but they are corrected.  Overall, we have a culture of improvement.<\/p><p> It is against this background of a progressive and well-governed higher education institution that one should set the anonymous letter allegations received by CIT from the Comptroller and Auditor General in mid-May 2014 and on Christmas Eve 2014.<\/p><p> In the first anonymous letter a total of 175 allegations were made.  Many of these were grossly defamatory on the face of it.  The anonymous letter was referred by the chairman of the governing body to the audit committee, which was authorised by the governing body to obtain independent legal advice.  Based on this advice and with the agreement of the governing body, the audit committee, via the independent legal advisers, Arthur Cox, tendered for and engaged KPMG to carry out an independent review of the allegations.  In the second anonymous letter a further 21 allegations were made.  Again, many of these appear to be grossly defamatory and all were considered by the audit committee of CIT.  The audit committee engaged KPMG to carry out a further independent review.  I will set out a summary of the outcome of the KPMG independent review.  Of a total of 196 allegations a total of 35 were deemed to have insufficient evidence to allow further review, 102 were deemed to require no further action because the allegations had been adequately addressed by the institute and 59 were deemed repetitious to other allegations and required no further action.<\/p><p> The governing body received updates from the audit committee during the process.  A final report issued from the audit committee and was considered by the governing body at its meeting of 26 March 2015.  It concluded that after two intensive external investigations all individuals and agencies identified within the letters had carried out their professional duties highly diligently and with total integrity.  The governing body concluded that no further response or action was required from the institute's executive.  A full copy of the audit committee's final report to the governing body and the KPMG reports have been provided to the HEA, the Department of Education and Skills and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The chair of the governing body has also provided the HEA with a full written account of the processes undertaken to address the matter.<\/p><p> CIT notes the concerns expressed by the Chairman of the committee in respect of the redacted KPMG report.  CIT wishes to state that no slight to the committee was intended at any stage.  CIT also respectfully notes that the committee has not made a direct request of CIT for the KPMG report.<\/p><p> CIT has a duty of care to protect the reputation of the institute, its employees and other organisations identified in the anonymous letters.  It has received legal advice on its obligations.  Given the concerns over the high level of personal information and entirely unfounded nature of the allegations contained in these reports CIT decided that all references to individuals, titles or organisations be redacted.  Any other detail of a confidential or sensitive nature that may have led to damage to the individuals or organisations or that may have served to identify same were also redacted.  The purpose of the provision of the redacted version of the reports was to provide documentary evidence that a full, comprehensive and independent investigation had been undertaken while also protecting the identities and reputations of those falsely accused.<\/p><p> The direct cost of the legal advice and investigation has amounted to some &euro;65,000, with a significant internal cost as well.  In recent days, the committee has requested other documentation relating to the KPMG reports as well as the cost of the due diligence exercise carried out for our Munster technological university stage 2 application.  These have been supplied.  The committee has also requested the minutes of the audit committee of the governing body since 2010 and the minutes of the CIT safety committee since 2010.  These have also been supplied.  As requested, we have also supplied a note recently relating to CIT cleaning staff and their sick pay.  We remain at the disposal of the committee to answer any questions that members may have on these and other matters.

We are concerned at a number of the procurement practices.  I suppose they fit within the overall governance practices that we have.  The primary responsibility on governance rests with the higher education institution in question.  They have to put in place the appropriate procedures under the governance arrangements that are in place.  An updated set of governance arrangements have been put in place by the HEA with them.  They are supposed to go through an internal system of financial control-review which is signed off by the audit committee and governing body and then the Chair, in person, reports to the Higher Education Authority.

We have many new central procurement arrangements, which are beginning to work well with the Office of Government Procurement, which the Accounting Officer of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has discussed with the committee.  In this context, the education sector is taking the lead in a number of areas.  Implementation can take a while for the new frameworks to be put in place in the structures.  Sometimes, an institution must roll over a contract and wait.  That is more understandable, but it would also be better were it not to be the case.  It has taken place as we have worked to put in place a new system.  In other instances, institutes have not appropriately tendered.  That is not acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#M01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1449741600,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Will the rolling review propose to capture all of these elements and ensure full compliance?

When the Comptroller and Auditor General learns of something, the HEA can pick up on it and engage.  Even with that, we believed that we needed something else.  We have identified the potential for rolling reviews in terms of governance, with procurement as the first priority.

Will Professor Donnelly or Mr. Boland offer an explanation as to why the report was not brought to the committee's attention.  I will cut to the chase and explain the reason it interests me.  There is no doubt that the level of expenditure and the manner of accounting for it using the president's office as a cost centre was hair-raising.  When we debated these matters the view was that the Professor Donnelly's predecessor, the former president, had acted extravagantly.  To some extent, that holds true to this day.  I will not pre-empt that but I note the report states that at no stage has it been suggested that any expenditure incurred in the president's office was for purposes other than that of the institute.  I am zoning in on that statement.  The tone of it moderates the position as regards Professor Donnelly's predecessor.  While it does not change the position entirely, it certainly moderates it as regards the former president's personal interest or lack thereof.  Certainly, there was no suggestion of personal gain.

I have talked about other third level institutes and the importance of consolidation.  Over the past several years, many of the third level institutions have established subsidiaries to carry out particular functions.  It is a perfectly reasonable approach to take to the business.  However, it is important that if there are assets, liabilities or transactions, they would be consolidated.  Accordingly, when the financial statements are given, one gets a full picture of what are the assets, liabilities and transactions of the entity, rather than a compartmentalised one.<\/p> <p>  Most of the colleges have moved to consolidate those or were already doing so.  Waterford Institute of Technology was different in that it maintained that there was complete independence between the subsidiaries and the institution, so it was not consolidating them.  The risk was that there was something going on in the companies.  We had no particular evidence that there was a problem, other than it looked like good practice, particularly because of the amount of money that was being given.<\/p> <p>  It transpired afterwards, however, that there were guarantees and undertakings provided by the college to the companies.  That certainly strengthened the case for ensuring they were consolidated.  This was confirmed by Mr. Quigley in his report.  Progress is being made.

These figures have a bearing on growth in the economy.  It is important that there be regional development and a connection with IDA Ireland.

In the past two years, we have introduced a very specific system for assessing the performance of the sector and the performance of individual institutions against stated national objectives.  This strategic dialogue, or performance management, tool is very valuable to ensure the higher education sector delivers what it is supposed to deliver.  In addition, we have a robust system of governance and accountability for the higher education sector.  There is no dispute among the institutions or anybody else that all of the institutions are accountable to the Government through the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills for every cent they spend, and by and large the system of governance works well.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McDonald mentioned earlier that procurement is honoured more in the breach than in the observance, and in fairness I take issue with this.  Procurement in any one year amounts to approximately &euro;1 billion and, overwhelmingly, it is done properly.  This is not in any way to excuse those instances in which it is not done properly, and there is zero tolerance of these types of departure from the norm, although putting it into practice can be somewhat difficult.  By and large, there is a strong higher education system delivering what Ireland needs.  It is well governed at institutional level and there is a good governance and accountability system in place.  I have said before that no system of governance is exempt from human error, and it will happen.  The particular job of the HEA is to ensure when it does happen that proper action is taken so it does not happen again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1449741600,"counter":339,"content":"<p>There are 170,000 students in the system.

I understand that there is correspondence, as Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; said, to clarify certain matters of expenditure.  The report here is a report to the HEA requested by the HEA.  It was prepared in response to a request from Mr. Boland and it refers to the recent media reports.  That appears to be its purpose.  The report deals mainly with everything that was in question at Committee of Public Accounts meetings relative to the cost centre referred to as the president's office.  It refers to the fact that it implied that &euro;3 million formed part of the expenditure of the office, and says that was misleading.  It makes other remarks that would discredit the original report that this was a spend that was way above the norm for an individual in an organisation, the president.  This report discredits what was said previously.  It says \"No\" and lays it all out.  It states clearly that at no stage did Deloitte or the governing body suggest that any expenditure incurred in the president's office was for a purpose other than the institute's.  Either the past statements were incorrect or this statement is incorrect.<\/p> <p>  I know we have moved on, but our task is to look at the accounts, the audit and the evidence before us and decide how best we can improve circumstances as we proceed.  I am a little shocked, Mr. Boland, having looked at this report.  Regardless of how long ago it was, and it is easy to dismiss it by saying it was four years ago, it is a topic we are dealing with at this meeting and it is part of the evidence and paperwork around that topic.  It deals with the credibility or otherwise of an individual who was employed there.  That is very important.  It is important that whatever might have been there previously, if the record must be corrected it should be corrected.  You should know your business.  After all, your organisation is responsible for the oversight of WIT and the others.  It is a little odd that you expect us to dismiss it on the basis of, \"It is a legal matter\", \"I cannot remember\" or \"It is a long time ago\", because all of the other bigger figures were remembered.<\/p> <p>  What is Ms Sheridan's role?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#T03500","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449741600,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I am the financial controller in WIT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#U00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1449741600,"counter":430,"content":"<p>What were Ms Sheridan's other roles there, if she had any?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#U00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449741600,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I was the finance manager prior to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1449741600,"counter":432,"content":"<p>Was she chairman-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#U00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449741600,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I was the chairman of the DCS for an interim period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#U00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1449741600,"counter":434,"content":"<p>Ms Sheridan was chairman of the companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#U00600","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449741600,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#U00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1449741600,"counter":436,"content":"<p>Ms Sheridan would have more knowledge than most people in this room because she were at the coalface of every one of these projects or management systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#U00800","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449741600,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#U00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1449741600,"counter":438,"content":"<p>What is her view on this?

We had that discussion a couple of months ago.  As it stands, we already have an Ombudsman for Children.  Deputy Daly's proposal, as far as I understand it, is made up of two parts.  The first is that he sees an ombudsman for education being active in giving policy advice.  The second function he envisages is not so much an ombudsman function as an appeals board function to allow for the making of determining decisions, which ombudsmen typically do not do.  We talked through those concepts with the Deputy, as I said.<\/p> <p>  The Government is advancing the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015 but, as the Minister indicated earlier this week, it is highly unlikely that it will be passed before the end of the current Oireachtas term.  In the admissions area, we wish to put in place enhanced regulation both in terms of the time applications are made to schools, which would provide clarity for everybody, and in respect of what might or might not be included in enrolment policy.  That, in essence, is what is involved in the legislation.  The Minister has signalled her view that there is a need to review the Equal Status Act provisions around denominational education.  The Bill has been published but not discussed in the Houses, so it is technically on First Stage.  The Minister has indicated that it was her intention to introduce amendments to provide for a parents' and students' charter, which, together with the new arrangements around enrolment, should remove enrolment to a significant extent from any necessary appeals mechanisms.<\/p> <p>  We would like to advance those initiatives and analyse their impact without putting a straight appeals mechanism in place which would have a determining say in schools' enrolment policies.  That is the issue we are focusing on in our emerging discussion with Deputy Daly.  We hope the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill will be taken in the next Oireachtas, in which case there will be further opportunities to consider the concept Deputy Daly has proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#X02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1449741600,"counter":638,"content":"<p>I take it from what Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is saying that, in a different way, the Department is putting together a type of appeals structure or mechanism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000002#X02600","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449741600,"counter":639,"content":"<p>In a different way, we are seeking to have these sorts of issues addressed in the first instance via the cultural aspect, with a view to ensuring schools are more responsive and transparent in their communities, with an opportunity also for appeals mechanisms.
