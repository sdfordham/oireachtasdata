National Sports Campus Development Authority, to be noted.  Maples and Calder represent the plaintiff in this case, Dublin Waterworld Limited.  The committee examined an issue in 2011 and 2012 and reported on the matter.  This correspondence seeks the permission of the committee to waive privilege so as to allow the defendant to get access to certain categories of documents in accordance with a High Court order.  There are two categories of documents.  The first is correspondence to the committee that now forms the record of the committee.  All of this has been published on our website and all was given to the Department.  As these documents are already in the public domain, the advice is that no issues of privilege arise and the plaintiff can be notified.  The second category of documents relates to records maintained by the plaintiff of correspondence with individual members.  These are not matters for the committee but for the plaintiff.  The matter is covered in Part 10 of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013.  The Clerk will write to Maples and Calder and apprise them of the position.<\/p><p>No. 3B.4 is correspondence, dated 1 December 2015, from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, regarding the registration of nurses, to be noted.<\/p><p>No. 3B.5 is correspondence received from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, regarding Mr. Patrick Coughlan, to be noted.<\/p><p>Nos. 3C.1 to 3C.9 are briefing documents and opening statements for today&rsquo;s meeting, all to be published.<\/p><p>I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment on No. 4.1, which comprises the financial statements of the Institute of Technology, Tallaght.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000003#B00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449741600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>With regard to the Institute of Technology, Tallaght, this is a clear audit opinion but I draw attention to the fact it did not carry out a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control, which is a specific requirement in the code of governance for institutes of technology.

The background to this is that F&aacute;ilte Ireland does not recognise a deferred pension funding asset for one of three defined pension schemes it operates.  Its argument for this is that it has not been provided with a guarantee in regard to the future liabilities of that scheme.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland recognises there is a liability that will have to be met, which, I understand, is of the order of &euro;240 million in total.  That is the body's estimate of benefits already accrued.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is recognising that the State will provide it with funding to meet some but not all of that liability.  It recognises some &euro;100 million of future funding as an asset on its balance sheet, which leaves it with a net liabilities position on the balance sheet of &euro;100 million.<\/p>  <p>  In most semi-State bodies, there is full recognition that the State will meet liabilities as they arise in the future and, on that basis, the full value of the asset is recognised.  That would change the look of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's balance sheet, putting it in a net assets position, as at 31 December 2014, of approximately &euro;42 million instead of that net liability.  It would also have an impact on its income and expenditure account whereby it would be showing a surplus of &euro;6 million for the year instead of a surplus of &euro;4.2 million.  Prior to its financial statements for 2013, F&aacute;ilte Ireland did recognise that asset, but the board has decided this is a more appropriate way to account for it.<\/p>  <p>  I am giving a qualified-audit opinion on this matter.  The practice of operating pay-as-you-go pension schemes has an implicit, as opposed to an explicit, commitment.  There is also the fact that the employees of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and many other State bodies are paying contributions into a pension scheme in the expectation they will receive benefits in the future.  The Department and the Minister have the difficulty that the funding for F&aacute;ilte Ireland comes by way of Estimate, which is voted every year by the D&aacute;il.  The Minister cannot bind the D&aacute;il to a commitment in this regard, which presents a technical difficulty.  However, there is no evidence the Department would seek to avoid meeting those commitments as they arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000004#C01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1449742200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>We will note all that is contained in No. 4.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000004#C01400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1449742200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I wish to raise something I should, perhaps, have raised under correspondence or the lack thereof, which is the case of Mr. Douglas Fannin.

I have already spoken to the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of information that has been given to me from a former employee of the Central Bank.  This employee was tasked with carrying out a review of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The Central Bank had been found not to be in compliance with those measures previously.  The Comptroller and Auditor General had correspondence with it in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  This individual joined the Central Bank in July 2014 to cover what was a temporary promotion but which subsequently transformed into a permanent promotion within the internal audit unit.  Between August and September 2014 this person carried out the field work in respect of the audit task in question and in October 2014 produced a draft report, of which I have a copy.  In the course of November there were discussions on the draft report and it is the strong view of the whistleblower that they were encouraged or instructed to omit, delete and amend certain findings within the draft.  The individual was so concerned that they made a protected disclosure on 17 November 2014 to Professor Patrick Honohan, the then Governor of the Central Bank.  The whistleblower had no further involvement in respect of completing this audit report.  He was tasked with other duties.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2014, Deloitte was invited to carry out an assessment of what had happened.  I also have a copy of that assessment.  Deloitte acknowledges that the whistleblower had resisted amending, deleting and omitting elements of the findings, however Deloitte found that, in its view, the actions of management in respect of the report may have been appropriate and in keeping.  I am trying to mimic the language it uses, because its language in the report is somewhat conditional.  On 21 December, the whistleblower was informed of the decision of Deloitte and on 23 December they were informed that their contract was coming to an end.  The person concerned has a live unfair dismissal action within the system, so we must respect that procedure.  Finally, on 29 January, the final audit report was produced, and I have it with me.  It does not bear the name of the whistleblower anywhere on it, even though they had been involved throughout the process.<\/p>  <p>  The reason I raise this, and the reason I approached the Comptroller and Auditor General, is that three very important issues arise.  The first is the behaviour within the audit division of the Central Bank and the practice of asking, encouraging or attempting to coerce people - who is to say? - into removing, altering or amending findings in an audit report.  The whistleblower concerned consulted with their professional body to establish, to the best of their ability, what their professional responsibilities were.  I have seen that correspondence also.<\/p> <p>An issue arises in this regard.  <\/p> <p> The second issue is the treatment of the whistleblower and the question that arises in my mind is was the whistleblower punished for speaking out, and for not going with the flow?  That is an important question.  <\/p> <p> Finally, in the longer term the issue for this committee relates to the finalised internal audit report which the Central Bank issued on 29 January 2015 and which was distributed to the then Governor, Patrick Honohan, the deputy governors, the chair of the audit committee and the chair of the risk committee.  It does not make for very good reading.  It shows that the Central Bank, as at 29 January 2015, is not compliant with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  As I cast my eye down the document I see the results as follows: in terms of composition of board and code of ethics, it is partially compliant and on remuneration or pay it is partially compliant.  We know there was a recent controversy around retention payments, or bonuses or whatever they are called, within the Central Bank.  In terms of risk management accountability internal control, it is partially compliant; on procurement it is partially compliant; on travel it is compliant - the only such case on the list; in terms of disposal of State assets and access to assets by third parties, it is non-compliant; and on tax compliance it is partially compliant.<\/p> <p> That is a very troubling account of the level of compliance of the Central Bank and in saying this it is not to adopt a fetish around the precision of audits or to argue over technicalities.  The reason I believe this report is troubling is that a lack of regulation, oversight, sloppiness and groupthink were all ingredients which led us to a catastrophic situation, not so much for the banks but for citizens, taxpayers and so on.  We can all in this committee room recall that time.  I have this document because it came in the package of documentation given to me by the whistleblower as a protected disclosure.  I emphasise that I have not been given anything that carries commercial sensitivity or that relates to another institution supervised or regulated by the Central Bank.<\/p> <p> The question is what we are to do about this.  I raised this matter yesterday with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  My view is that there is a need for some serious questions to be answered in respect of practices within the audit division and in respect of the culture and the atmosphere within it.  That it would be considered, in any way, shape or form, good practice to lean on somebody to take findings out of a draft report smacks of the worst of the bad practice of the old days.  There are questions around the whistleblower, not including the unfair dismissal issue, which is separate.  Was the whistleblower punished?  Is that what happens within the Central Bank?  I would like to know.  <\/p> <p> Finally, and perhaps most important, we need answers as to why, at 29 January 2015, there is a litany of non-compliance on the part of the Central Bank.  We have a right to expect best practice from the Central Bank and I do not think it is an outlandish thing to look for.  This is an internal document as audits, by their nature, tend to be but good practice and compliance within the Central Bank are not a private matter.  They are a matter of the utmost public concern and we need to find a mechanism through which we can investigate it.  I suggest the committee seek a copy of the internal report of 29 January and seek an opportunity to question the Central Bank on these matters.  There are obvious issues for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and I do not know if he has had sight of this document.  If he has, I would like to know his response to it and what he proposes to do about it.  If he has not seen it, I would like to know why.  I am conscious that I have documentation which other committee members do not have so I will seek advice as to whether I can share the information with members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000005#D03300","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449743400,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Deputy McDonald has the information and we do not.

In light of what the Deputy has raised, I would like to find a process or a mechanism whereby we could get to the bottom of some of the issues which might be relevant to us in terms of audit but we will have to take some advice on it.

The origination of the internal audit work probably goes back to an issue we raised in a 2013 management letter to the Central Bank.  There was an ongoing issue with holding the Central Bank to account in relation to things like procurement so we made a recommendation that they carry out a comprehensive review of the extent to which they were compliant with the code of practice.  This is possibly the first instalment of a programmed review relating to four main areas: the operation and construction of the board of directors; code of conduct and ethics; remuneration; risk management accountability; and internal control and internal audit.  There were specific procedures to be followed by State bodies on procurement, travel, disposal of State assets and access to assets by third parties, as well as tax compliance.  We suggested that to the Central Bank and it undertook this work in 2014.  We received a copy of the results of the internal audit in March 2015, around the time we were completing the audit of the 2014 financial statements.  It was an exercise the Central Bank needed to do and actions arising from the audit needed to be followed up fairly promptly.  When we audit the 2015 financial statements we will revisit the matter to see what action has been taken on the recommendations of the internal audit and what progress has been made in investigating other aspects of the code of practice.<\/p>  <p>  The statement on internal financial control is at the front of the financial statements.<\/p> <p>It includes a reference to the applicability or otherwise of the code of practice.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>The European treaties ... provide that the Central Bank of Ireland is independent of the Government and so Government decisions, codes of practice and circulars do not apply directly to the bank.  However, the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies is largely applied by the Bank.  In accordance with the Central Bank Acts 1942 to 2014, remuneration of Bank staff is set by the Commission.  The Bank is guided by Government policy on staff remuneration.<\/blockquote><p>In the statement on internal financial control, the bank also disclosed that:<\/p><blockquote>During 2014, expenditure of &euro;4 million ... approximately 4% ... of the Bank&rsquo;s committed spend, was incurred across 42 contracts without recourse to a public procurement tender process.  Of the 42 contracts ... 28 have been regularised during the year, and there is an action plan in place to address the remaining 14 contracts.<\/blockquote><p>Where significant weaknesses in control are disclosed, there is a requirement for the Central Bank to include them in the statement on internal financial control.  We will come back to it.  The audit was informed that there was a whistleblower event in 2014 and we will investigate the matter further in the audit of the 2015 financial statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449744000,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McDonald for raising the issue.

More recently, a whistleblower challenged the Central Bank's stress test system and suggested it was not all it appeared to be.  In the case of Eugene McErlean, the Central Bank was subsequently found to be wrong.  When Matthew Elderfield came before the committee we asked him questions about the second whistleblower.  He was more than reluctant to answer any questions and left an unsatisfactory situation in which we never got to the bottom of why the whistleblower had found the Central Bank a very cold climate in which to blow the whistle.  We never found out what happened to the whistleblower.  It was unsatisfactory.  Now we have another case.  We cannot accept that it is outside our remit.

This is the first cut at dealing with the issues, which is welcome.  During the process, it transpired that an auditor within the Central Bank had fallen foul of the process.  Nobody disputes the fact that the person resisted removing, amending or omitting elements of his or her work from the report.  Deloitte judged whether management was justified in it.  It is worrying in itself.  It came late to the process, and the controversy emerged during the process.  The real question is whether the whistleblower was punished, directly or indirectly, as a result of the position he or she took in carrying out his or her professional duties.  It is a fundamental question that must be answered.  The whistleblower believes he or she was punished for resisting the removal, omission or amendment of findings from the report.  Although I cannot definitively prove it is true, there is a body of documentation that echoes the whistleblower's concerns.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Ross has hit the nail on the head regarding the pattern around whistleblowers.  The big brick wall seems to be that while one can ask the questions, one has no right to any answer or any form of reasonable transparency from the Central Bank.  The Central Bank is independent, for very good reasons, as set out in the treaties as part of the euro system.  However, these are matters of internal governance, best practice and decent standards.  It is unacceptable that Members of the Oireachtas cannot ask questions and get answers on simple compliance issues such as this.  If it is no big deal, if everything is okay and there is nothing for any of us to be concerned about, there should be no difficulty with the Central Bank providing its final report to the committee and providing representatives to talk to us about the process and explain why, in this tranche of the investigation, the results are partially compliant, partially compliant, partially compliant, compliant in one case, non-compliant and partially compliant.<\/p> <p>That is not good enough.

The audit was completed in June of this year.  Delays in the production of audited financial statements have also occurred in previous years, related in part to a complex set of issues affecting the institute, which the committee has previously examined.  Unusually among the institutes of technology, Waterford Institute of Technology set up a number of companies in the 1990s to provide a range of ancillary services such as student accommodation, catering, sporting and recreation activities and retail outlets.  These companies are grouped as Diverse Campus Services Limited.  The scale of operation of the companies expanded over time and they undertook a number of major capital projects.  Diverse Campus Services receives substantial block funding each year from the institute.  A note to the institute&rsquo;s financial statements gives summary information about the companies&rsquo; operations, but their results are not consolidated with those of the institute.  Based on the nature and pattern of interaction between the institute and the companies, we concluded they are part of the normal services typically provided on the campuses of third level institutions and they should be included in consolidated accounts produced by the institute.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2012, the Minister for Education and Skills commissioned Mr. Dermot Quigley to undertake a statutory inspection to review the relationship between the institute and the companies.  His report was published in July 2013.  He recommended that the companies should be restructured as subsidiaries of the institute and that the institute should then produce consolidated financial statements for the group.  This process has been ongoing.  The income and expenditure account shows the institute had income of &euro;84.7 million in 2012-13.  Expenditure for the year amounted to just under &euro;85 million, including a transfer of &euro;3.3 million to Diverse Campus Services.  This left the institute with an operating deficit of approximately &euro;300,000 for the year.  Note 26 to the financial statements acknowledges that the institute has incurred operating deficits for three consecutive years and discloses the rationale for the governing body&rsquo;s belief that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.  I have drawn attention to this note in the audit certificate.<\/p>  <p>  The audit certificate also draws attention to three disclosures about governance issues included in the statement on internal control, relating to non-compliance by the institute with the code of governance of Irish institutes of technology.  First, the governing body did not carry out a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the system of internal controls in respect of the year of accounts, as it is required to do.  Second, the institute&rsquo;s audit committee did not issue an annual report to the governing body until September 2014 due to the committee&rsquo;s concerns about the timely provision to it of key information.  Finally, there were four areas of expenditure with a total value of &euro;524,000 where public procurement rules were not complied with.  As a consequence of delays experienced on the 2012-13 audit, we were unable to commence fieldwork in respect of the 2013-14 financial statements until July of this year.  The institute is carrying out some additional analysis in relation to issues raised during the audit and has indicated that it expects to respond to the audit queries early in 2016.  Assuming we are satisfied with the responses, I hope the financial statements can be certified before Easter.  I expect they will reflect full consolidation of the Diverse Campus Services companies.<\/p>  <p>  The consolidated income and expenditure account for Cork Institute of Technology for the 2013-14 year shows an operating deficit of &euro;126,000 for the year ended 31 August 2014.  This compares to a surplus of over &euro;1.4 million in the previous year.  The institute&rsquo;s income for the 2013-14 financial year was &euro;98.6 million.  The institute incurred expenditure of &euro;98.7 million in the year, with staff costs accounting for &euro;64.2 million or 65% of the total.  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the 2013-14 financial statements.  In March 2014, my office received anonymous correspondence containing a large number of allegations in regard to Cork Institute of Technology.  Similar correspondence was received by the Committee of Public Accounts at that time.  In view of the breadth of the allegations, my office sent a copy of the correspondence to the chairman of the governing body of Cork Institute of Technology, rather than to the president, who is the accountable person.  We sent copies of the correspondence to the president of the institute, the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority.  We asked to be kept informed about the actions proposed to investigate the allegations.  Following a tender process, the institute appointed KPMG in October 2014 to investigate the allegations.  We were informed by the institute in December 2014 that the investigation had been completed and that a full detailed report would issue in due course.<\/p>  <p>  On 22 December 2014, my office received additional correspondence, apparently from the same anonymous source.  This contained further allegations and repeated some of the allegations raised in the March 2014 correspondence.  We sent a copy of the new correspondence to Cork Institute of Technology, the Department and the Higher Education Authority.  On 2 April 2015, we received a letter from the chairman of the institute&rsquo;s governing body indicating that the audit committee had finalised its review of the allegations made in the anonymous correspondence and of KPMG&rsquo;s findings from its investigations.  The letter enclosed a copy of KPMG&rsquo;s report.  KPMG counted a total of 196 allegations made in the two sets of correspondence.  It concluded that 66 allegations were repetition of other allegations, 33 allegations did not contain sufficient information to allow investigation and the remaining 97 allegations had been adequately addressed by explanations and documentary evidence provided by the institute.  KPMG reported that it had found no evidence of wrongdoing in relation to the allegations but it did identify a small number of control improvement opportunities in regard to three of them.<\/p>  <p>  While carrying out the audit of Cork Institute of Technology&rsquo;s 2013-14 financial statements, my office assessed the appropriateness of the institute&rsquo;s response to the allegations made and reviewed KPMG's report and findings.  We concluded that the institute's response to the allegations was prompt.  We were satisfied that the investigation carried out by KPMG was appropriate and adequate.  We saw no reason to disagree with the conclusions it reached.  We concluded that the control weaknesses identified by KPMG in its review of three of the allegations were in the nature of management point letters, which we are following up during the audit of the 2014-15 financial statements.  I concluded that there was no requirement for me to report formally to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in regard to the issues raised in the anonymous correspondence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000009#H01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449745800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to make this statement concerning the 2013 financial statements of Waterford Institute of Technology and the 2014 financial statements of Cork Institute of Technology.  I have already forwarded some advance briefing to the committee and will therefore keep this opening statement short.  I assure the committee that the governance and accountability of the higher education institutions is an important matter for the Department and the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  The Department, with the co-operation of the HEA, is committed to ensuring appropriate and efficient structures are in place to allow for a system of good accountability in the sector.  I have set out in the background note the measures under way to enhance the system in place.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to mention in particular, the Department&rsquo;s intention, in conjunction with the HEA, to commence a series of corporate governance compliance reviews utilising a centralised procurement framework to deliver reviews which will evaluate the effectiveness of governance in organisations against stated policy, best practice, national and international standards.  The review process may focus on a specific aspect or area of governance or may be broader in scope.  The Department has recently agreed with the HEA that the first rolling review, so-called, of governance compliance will be on procurement and will look at practices across the third level sector.  The terms of reference have been finalised, with the review expected to be undertaken in the first quarter of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  On Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, as the committee is aware, the Minister took the exceptional step to initiate a statutory inspection into the relationship between Waterford Institute of Technology and companies providing campus services to it in November 2012.  The HEA had been liaising with WIT since 2011 in an effort to regularise the relationship between the institute and the companies concerned.  The process was quite complex, especially given the financial arrangements in place and the imminent liabilities relating to the Manor Village student accommodation development and the Carriganore complex.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Quigley provided his report to the Minister in June 2013.  He concluded that while the arrangements were well motivated, they were not appropriate and he recommended a reactivation of the process to acquire and restructure the companies as full subsidiaries of the institute.  He also recommended that the institute proceed with a buy-out of the Manor Village development and the completion of the Carriganore sports complex.  A full overview of the report&rsquo;s recommendations has been provided to the committee in briefing material.  The Department would like to acknowledge the positive engagement shown by both the institute and the companies during this inspection process, and the acceptance of and the speedy implementation of Mr. Quigley&rsquo;s recommendations.  This consolidation process is now complete and the Department is arranging for Mr. Quigley to review current arrangements with a view to reporting to the Minister in the spring.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that the committee has taken a particular interest in the current status of the Carriganore sports complex in WIT.  As the committee is aware, the project commenced in January 2012, and significant work was completed on it during the year.  In parallel, the institute was working towards a regularisation of its relationship with the companies.  As the institute was not in a position to access borrowings, other sources of finance were put in place to bring the development to a safe and protected state in early 2013.  As noted by Mr. Quigley, this resulted in &ldquo;major financial headaches from both DCS and WIT&rdquo;.  To protect the investment already made, Mr. Quigley recommended the completion of the Carriganore development and that moneys should be made available to the institute, either through a borrowing facility or Department funding, to do this.  In response, the Department initially committed &euro;2.5 million to provide for the completion of the project.  This was communicated to the committee previously.  There has been an extensive interaction between the Department and WIT since then in an effort to assist WIT in ensuring a final resolution of the issues which were the subject of Mr. Quigley&rsquo;s report.  This engagement has been intensified in recent months as the tender competition for the project drew to a close and complete clarity was finally brought to the costs involved.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, my officials wrote to WIT on 8 October seeking some final documentation on 27 November last to confirm our proposal to provide an additional &euro;2.1 million to enable the completion of the sports complex and to finalise the implementation of the recommendations set out by Mr. Quigley in his report.  Following WIT&rsquo;s acceptance of the proposal, the Minister announced the additional funding on 1 December.  The funding brings the Department&rsquo;s total outlay towards both the purchase of the Manor Village student accommodation development and the completion of the sports complex to &euro;12.1 million.  This positive engagement will culminate in the completion of a valuable project for Waterford IT.  Cognisant of the benefits to all stakeholders involved in the Carriganore sports complex and the financial situation of the institute, the complex will become a fully functional facility which will benefit the staff and students of WIT as well as the wider local community.<\/p>  <p>  On the anonymous correspondence on a number of issues in Cork Institute of Technology, the committee is aware that KPMG has undertaken a review of the allegations.  The report on the first set of allegations involved a review of the 175 allegations identified within the anonymous correspondence.  KPMG also provided a detailed report on the 21 allegations contained in the second anonymous letter.  Both consultant's reports have been submitted to the HEA and they have found no evidence to support the main thrust of the allegations.  The HEA followed up with CIT in respect of some minor issues that arose during the review and these matters have since been addressed.  The HEA has confirmed to the Department that, based on the KPMG reports and supporting information supplied by CIT, it is satisfied with the process implemented by CIT in investigating the allegations.  I am happy to answer questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000010#J00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449745800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I will focus on two issues, the Carriganore project in Waterford Institute of Technology and the anonymous allegations relating to Cork Institute of Technology.  In regard to Waterford Institute of Technology, the HEA notes Mr. Eugene McKenna&rsquo;s correspondence to the committee on 10 October 2015.  The HEA was aware of the potential consequences of the institute not proceeding with the Carriganore project, but there was no legitimate funding route available to allow the project to continue.  WIT has no power to borrow either directly or through letters of comfort or guarantee.  The proposal from DCS was therefore <i>ultra vires <\/i>the institute.  There are no circumstances whatsoever in which the HEA could condone such actions.<br\/><br\/>In July 2012, the project was over 60% complete, with works to the value of &euro;6.5 million completed on site.  There were, however, no funds available to progress the project without borrowings, and the development committee was forced to terminate the contract.  The HEA was aware that it is not good practice to terminate the employment of a contractor prior to the completion of a contract.  Unfortunately, no other options existed as the project had not been procured in accordance with public procurement guidelines or the capital works management framework, and a moratorium on new capital projects in the higher education sector was introduced in November 2011 which prevented any capital grants being issued to support completion.<br\/><br\/>The HEA raised concerns regarding the relationship between the institute, the development committee and its associated subsidiary companies as far back as January 2011.  The governing body was also known to be considering the relationship.  On 14 October 2011, the HEA wrote to Mr. Tony McFeely, then acting president, and sought details of outcomes of discussions at governing body level and requested that the institute put in place a team of appropriately qualified personnel to examine these and related issues and report back to the governing body.<br\/><br\/>While this examination was progressing, the acting president of WIT, Mr. Tony McFeely, provided a so-called letter of comfort to the development committee regarding the funding of phase 3 at Carriganore.  A report on the governance relationships did not issue until June 2012 and the governing body adopted the report and approved the implementation of the preferred option &ldquo;to revise the structure of the development committee and Campus Services and make them subsidiary undertakings of WIT under new management arrangements&rdquo;.  Numerous challenges faced the institute regarding the consolidation and transfer of significant debts and future liabilities onto its balance sheet.<br\/><br\/>On 13 November 2012, the Minister for Education and Skills appointed Mr. Dermot Quigley as inspector to carry out, pursuant to section 20 of the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006, a statutory inspection of companies providing a range of services in WIT.  The report produced confirmed the relationships between WIT, DCS and the subsidiary companies were inappropriate.  Fundamentally, the institute was wrong in providing letters of comfort to support borrowings for the Carriganore development.<br\/><br\/><font color=\"#FF0000\">  <\/font>In terms of Cork Institute of Technology, as the committee is aware, in March 2014 the Comptroller and Auditor General received anonymous correspondence containing a significant number of allegations in respect of CIT.  The correspondence was subsequently forwarded to both CIT and the HEA.  In late December 2014, a further set of anonymous allegations relating to CIT was received.  CIT commissioned an independent firm of auditors, KPMG, to review and report on both sets of allegations.  The HEA notes that KPMG carried out a detailed and thorough investigation of these allegations and that only minor matters of clarification were required.  The HEA further notes that CIT&rsquo;s audit committee was satisfied that the matters had been diligently and appropriately investigated.<br\/><br\/>During the review process the HEA remained in close contact with CIT.  It also had the opportunity to review the allegations as well as the KPMG findings and has itself sought additional information or clarification as required from CIT.<\/p> <p>This information was provided to the HEA in a comprehensive and timely manner.  The HEA is satisfied that a detailed and thorough investigation was carried out by CIT and its auditors, with the auditors identifying no significant issues arising.<\/p> <p> In circumstances such as these, it is vital that higher education institutions have processes in place to carry out comprehensive and independent investigations.  This is because it is institutions and, in particular, their governing bodies that are primarily responsible for the management and operation of their internal affairs.  In the context of dealing with specific allegations, institutions are expected to comply with the provisions of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and have procedures in place whereby employees may in confidence raise any concern about possible irregularities in financial, operational or other matters.  Indeed, confirmation that such procedures are in place is now a requirement of annual governance reporting arrangements to the HEA.  The 2014 Act also provides for disclosures relating to higher education matters to be made to me in my position as chief executive of the HEA.<\/p> <p> I am happy to take whatever questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000010#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449746400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to update the committee regarding matters raised at previous meetings and issues reported in the financial statement of the institute for the year ending 31 August 2013.  The briefing document supplied to the committee last week presents a detailed response to the various matters reported in the 2013 financial statements.<\/p>  <p>  I propose in my opening statement to concentrate on two major issues that have been the subject of considerable comment at recent meetings of the committee.  These are progress in respect of the relationship between Waterford Institute of Technology and Diverse Campus Services Limited, DCS, including on the implementation of the recommendations of the Quigley report, and the status of the Carriganore sports campus development.  I will make particular reference to the contents of three separate but related reports, those being, Special Report No. 78 of the Comptroller and Auditor General: Matters Arising out of Educational Audits, which was issued in February 2012; the Grant Thornton report published in June 2012 on behalf of the governing body of the institute; and the Quigley report, which was issued in June 2013 to the Minister for Education and Skills.  These reports focused on the relationship between WIT and DCS, the company providing canteen and other services on campus.<\/p>  <p>  Briefly, report No. 78 reads, \"The patterns of interaction between WIT and a range of companies that provide services (canteen, residences, recreation facilities, retail outlet and sports hall) on campus suggest that the related activities are part of the normal services typically provided on the campuses of third level institutions and that they should be included in consolidated accounts produced by the Institute.\"  WIT accepted and agreed with this recommendation.  Indeed, at the time of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, WIT's governing body had already commenced a review of WIT and DCS's relationship and commissioned a report from Grant Thornton.  The Grant Thornton report was presented to the governing body in June 2012 and recommended that DCS and its subsidiary companies should be restructured under new management as subsidiary companies of WIT.  The institute also accepted the recommendations included in the above reports and set about incorporating the DCS companies within WIT and consolidating their accounts within the WIT accounts.<\/p>  <p>  This was overtaken by the appointment in November 2012 of Mr. Dermot Quigley by the Minister for Education and Skills as an inspector under section 20 of the Institutes of Technology Acts to review the relationship between WIT and these companies.  The institute welcomed Mr. Quigley's recommendations, which were published in June 2013.  His report points to aspects of the relationship between WIT and DCS that could be considered \"inappropriate\" in so far as they \"had adverse effects on governance at the Institute and on the management of its financial affairs\".<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to report that the institute has addressed the key issues raised in Special Report No. 78.  The institute has also implemented the recommendations of the Quigley report and full details of their implementation are contained in the briefing documentation supplied to the committee.  Specifically, the governance and internal control environments in the DCS group have been addressed.  The DCS board has been reconfigured with appointments of representatives from the governing body, institute staff and an external chair.  The code of governance for the institutes of technology has been implemented by DCS as far as is practical.  These new structures reinforce the alignment of the vision and purpose of the DCS companies with the institutional strategy and the needs of the student community.  The process of ensuring that alignment into the future is ongoing.  The consolidation of the financial accounts of DCS and WIT has been completed within the 2014 financial statements, which are under audit, as mentioned in the briefing documentation.<\/p>  <p>  I will turn my attention to the status of the Carriganore sports complex development.  The key factors that led to the failure to complete the complex were the overdependence of DCS on financial support from WIT, DCS's increasing loan repayments and falling revenue, and the impact of the economic downturn on the institute's financial position.  It would have been logical for DCS and WIT to re-evaluate the economic viability of phase 3 of Carriganore, in particular given that phases 1 and 2 entailed an integrated building that did not require phase 3.  The sensible conclusion would have been not to have proceeded with phase 3 of the sports complex.  This point was noted by Mr. Quigley, who stated it was unfortunate that a decision was made to continue with this phase.<\/p>  <p>  The commencement of phase 3 created major pressure on the institute&rsquo;s resources.  Notwithstanding its decreasing financial resources, the institute made every effort to support the continued development of Carriganore, specifically through the transfer of &euro;6.1 million from the institute to DCS during 2012.  By the end of 2012, however, WIT and DCS did not have access to additional financial resources to invest in the sports campus.  In addition, WIT's end-of-year accounts were showing a financial deficit.  The institute was forced to terminate works on the complex and secure an unfinished building.  This resulted in a cost for exiting the project and inevitably a cost for restarting the project at a later stage.<\/p>  <p>  Following the Quigley report, the Department of Education and Skills made some funds available to the institute.  These were sufficient to pay the outstanding costs for the Manor Village student accommodation complex, which was another DCS project.  However, the residue was not sufficient to cover the cost of reopening and completing phase 3 of Carriganore.<\/p>  <p>  I was appointed president in April 2015.  Since then, I have focused on ensuring sufficient funds are available to complete and open the sports complex.  Following further engagement with the Department of Education and Skills, sufficient funds have been made available to complete the building.  I am pleased that a sustainable repayment schedule for all moneys due to the Department is in place.  I am also engaging with the HEA in developing a three-year strategy to restore the institute's financial independence on an ongoing sustainable basis and to focus our resources on the continued education and economic development of the south east.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the consolidation of companies and associated matters, the institute has responded fully to the concerns raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in Special Report No. 78 and has implemented the majority of the recommendations of the Quigley report.  The future strategic development of DCS is aligned with the institute's strategic priorities.  The company's financial and governance structures are also aligned with best practice.  The role of the governing body from a governance, oversight and reporting perspective in respect of the subsidiaries is clear.  All projects now have a robust and sustainable financial plan in place that will realise significant assets for the institute, the region of Waterford and the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000011#K00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Willie Donnelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449746400,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for its invitation to attend this meeting on the financial statements of Cork Institute of Technology for 2014.  CIT is one of the largest, most progressive and most successful institutes of technology in the country, with 11,000 higher education students, approximately 3,000 craft and junior music students and a staff of 1,400.  It operates on four major sites in Cork city and county.  CIT is institute of technology of the year for 2016, our third time in the past decade, and in partnership with IT Tralee, it has successfully completed three of the four stages of technological university designation.<\/p>  <p>  The quality of CIT's education programmes and research are overseen by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, and its governance is provided by its governing body and through its three committees, namely, audit, finance and strategic development.<\/p> <p>It operates under the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006 and the Higher Education Authority has a regulatory oversight of CIT.  Higher education in Ireland has been operating in a challenging financial environment since 2008 with a significant increase in higher education student numbers, reduced staff numbers and reduced State funding.  Even though CIT continued to be successful in this period, it is not immune to these financial challenges, as may be seen in our 2014 financial statements.  We anticipate no immediate improvement in our financial situation in 2015 with a continuing reduction in State funding, increasing pay costs and a continuing need to dip into our relatively small reserves for essential maintenance and health and safety works.<\/p> <p> The results of the Comptroller and Auditor General audit in 2014 complements the result of our internal audit reports.  Any issues raised in these audit reports are carefully considered by the governing body, its audit committee and the executive.  They are then followed up and corrected.  Controls are strengthened and they are monitored by the audit committee.  As in any institution, mistakes are made, but they are corrected.  Overall, we have a culture of improvement.<\/p> <p> It is against this background of a progressive and well-governed higher education institution that one should set the anonymous letter allegations received by CIT from the Comptroller and Auditor General in mid-May 2014 and on Christmas Eve 2014.<\/p> <p> In the first anonymous letter a total of 175 allegations were made.  Many of these were grossly defamatory on the face of it.  The anonymous letter was referred by the chairman of the governing body to the audit committee, which was authorised by the governing body to obtain independent legal advice.  Based on this advice and with the agreement of the governing body, the audit committee, via the independent legal advisers, Arthur Cox, tendered for and engaged KPMG to carry out an independent review of the allegations.  In the second anonymous letter a further 21 allegations were made.  Again, many of these appear to be grossly defamatory and all were considered by the audit committee of CIT.  The audit committee engaged KPMG to carry out a further independent review.  I will set out a summary of the outcome of the KPMG independent review.  Of a total of 196 allegations a total of 35 were deemed to have insufficient evidence to allow further review, 102 were deemed to require no further action because the allegations had been adequately addressed by the institute and 59 were deemed repetitious to other allegations and required no further action.<\/p> <p> The governing body received updates from the audit committee during the process.  A final report issued from the audit committee and was considered by the governing body at its meeting of 26 March 2015.  It concluded that after two intensive external investigations all individuals and agencies identified within the letters had carried out their professional duties highly diligently and with total integrity.  The governing body concluded that no further response or action was required from the institute's executive.  A full copy of the audit committee's final report to the governing body and the KPMG reports have been provided to the HEA, the Department of Education and Skills and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The chair of the governing body has also provided the HEA with a full written account of the processes undertaken to address the matter.<\/p> <p> CIT notes the concerns expressed by the Chairman of the committee in respect of the redacted KPMG report.  CIT wishes to state that no slight to the committee was intended at any stage.  CIT also respectfully notes that the committee has not made a direct request of CIT for the KPMG report.<\/p> <p> CIT has a duty of care to protect the reputation of the institute, its employees and other organisations identified in the anonymous letters.  It has received legal advice on its obligations.  Given the concerns over the high level of personal information and entirely unfounded nature of the allegations contained in these reports CIT decided that all references to individuals, titles or organisations be redacted.  Any other detail of a confidential or sensitive nature that may have led to damage to the individuals or organisations or that may have served to identify same were also redacted.  The purpose of the provision of the redacted version of the reports was to provide documentary evidence that a full, comprehensive and independent investigation had been undertaken while also protecting the identities and reputations of those falsely accused.<\/p> <p> The direct cost of the legal advice and investigation has amounted to some &euro;65,000, with a significant internal cost as well.  In recent days, the committee has requested other documentation relating to the KPMG reports as well as the cost of the due diligence exercise carried out for our Munster technological university stage 2 application.  These have been supplied.  The committee has also requested the minutes of the audit committee of the governing body since 2010 and the minutes of the CIT safety committee since 2010.  These have also been supplied.  As requested, we have also supplied a note recently relating to CIT cleaning staff and their sick pay.  We remain at the disposal of the committee to answer any questions that members may have on these and other matters.

We are concerned at a number of the procurement practices.  I suppose they fit within the overall governance practices that we have.  The primary responsibility on governance rests with the higher education institution in question.  They have to put in place the appropriate procedures under the governance arrangements that are in place.  An updated set of governance arrangements have been put in place by the HEA with them.  They are supposed to go through an internal system of financial control-review which is signed off by the audit committee and governing body and then the Chair, in person, reports to the Higher Education Authority.

We have many new central procurement arrangements, which are beginning to work well with the Office of Government Procurement, which the Accounting Officer of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has discussed with the committee.  In this context, the education sector is taking the lead in a number of areas.  Implementation can take a while for the new frameworks to be put in place in the structures.  Sometimes, an institution must roll over a contract and wait.  That is more understandable, but it would also be better were it not to be the case.  It has taken place as we have worked to put in place a new system.  In other instances, institutes have not appropriately tendered.  That is not acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000013#M01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1449747600,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Will the rolling review propose to capture all of these elements and ensure full compliance?

When the Comptroller and Auditor General learns of something, the HEA can pick up on it and engage.  Even with that, we believed that we needed something else.  We have identified the potential for rolling reviews in terms of governance, with procurement as the first priority.

Will Professor Donnelly or Mr. Boland offer an explanation as to why the report was not brought to the committee's attention.  I will cut to the chase and explain the reason it interests me.  There is no doubt that the level of expenditure and the manner of accounting for it using the president's office as a cost centre was hair-raising.  When we debated these matters the view was that the Professor Donnelly's predecessor, the former president, had acted extravagantly.  To some extent, that holds true to this day.  I will not pre-empt that but I note the report states that at no stage has it been suggested that any expenditure incurred in the president's office was for purposes other than that of the institute.  I am zoning in on that statement.  The tone of it moderates the position as regards Professor Donnelly's predecessor.  While it does not change the position entirely, it certainly moderates it as regards the former president's personal interest or lack thereof.  Certainly, there was no suggestion of personal gain.

I have talked about other third level institutes and the importance of consolidation.  Over several years, many of the third level institutions have established subsidiaries to carry out particular functions.  It is a perfectly reasonable approach to take to the business.  However, it is important that if there are assets, liabilities or transactions, they would be consolidated.  Accordingly, when the financial statements are presented, one gets a full picture of what are the assets, liabilities and transactions of the entity, rather than a compartmentalised one.<\/p>  <p>  Most of the colleges have moved to consolidate those or were already doing so.  Waterford Institute of Technology was different in that it maintained that there was complete independence between the subsidiaries and the institution, so it was not consolidating them.  The risk was that there was something going on in the companies.  We had no particular evidence that there was a problem. We felt consolidation would be good practice, particularly because of the amount of money that was being given.<\/p>  <p>  It transpired afterwards, however, that there were guarantees and undertakings provided by the college to the companies.  That certainly strengthened the case for ensuring they were consolidated.  This was confirmed by Mr. Quigley in his report.  Progress is being made.

These figures have a bearing on growth in the economy.  It is important that there be regional development and a connection with IDA Ireland.

In the past two years, we have introduced a very specific system for assessing the performance of the sector and the performance of individual institutions against stated national objectives.  This strategic dialogue, or performance management, tool is very valuable to ensure the higher education sector delivers what it is supposed to deliver.  In addition, we have a robust system of governance and accountability for the higher education sector.  There is no dispute among the institutions or anybody else that all of the institutions are accountable to the Government through the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills for every cent they spend, and by and large the system of governance works well.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald mentioned earlier that procurement is honoured more in the breach than in the observance, and in fairness I take issue with this.  Procurement in any one year amounts to approximately &euro;1 billion and, overwhelmingly, it is done properly.  This is not in any way to excuse those instances in which it is not done properly, and there is zero tolerance of these types of departure from the norm, although putting it into practice can be somewhat difficult.  By and large, there is a strong higher education system delivering what Ireland needs.  It is well governed at institutional level and there is a good governance and accountability system in place.  I have said before that no system of governance is exempt from human error, and it will happen.  The particular job of the HEA is to ensure when it does happen that proper action is taken so it does not happen again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000018#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1449750600,"counter":339,"content":"<p>There are 170,000 students in the system.

I understand that there is correspondence, as Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; said, to clarify certain matters of expenditure.  The report here is a report to the HEA requested by the HEA.  It was prepared in response to a request from Mr. Boland and it refers to the recent media reports.  That appears to be its purpose.  The report deals mainly with everything that was in question at Committee of Public Accounts meetings relative to the cost centre referred to as the president's office.  It refers to the fact that it implied that &euro;3 million formed part of the expenditure of the office, and says that was misleading.  It makes other remarks that would discredit the original report that this was a spend that was way above the norm for an individual in an organisation, the president.  This report discredits what was said previously.  It says \"No\" and lays it all out.  It states clearly that at no stage did Deloitte or the governing body suggest that any expenditure incurred in the president's office was for a purpose other than the institute's.  Either the past statements were incorrect or this statement is incorrect.<\/p>  <p>  I know we have moved on, but our task is to look at the accounts, the audit and the evidence before us and decide how best we can improve circumstances as we proceed.  I am a little shocked, Mr. Boland, having looked at this report.  Regardless of how long ago it was, and it is easy to dismiss it by saying it was four years ago, it is a topic we are dealing with at this meeting and it is part of the evidence and paperwork around that topic.  It deals with the credibility or otherwise of an individual who was employed there.  That is very important.  It is important that whatever might have been there previously, if the record must be corrected it should be corrected.  You should know your business.  After all, your organisation is responsible for the oversight of WIT and the others.  It is a little odd that you expect us to dismiss it on the basis of, \"It is a legal matter\", \"I cannot remember\" or \"It is a long time ago\", because all of the other bigger figures were remembered.<\/p>  <p>  What is Ms Sheridan's role?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000020#T03500","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449752400,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I am the financial controller in WIT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000021#U00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1449752400,"counter":430,"content":"<p>What were Ms Sheridan's other roles there, if she had any?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000021#U00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449752400,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I was the finance manager prior to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000021#U00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1449752400,"counter":432,"content":"<p>Was she chairman-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000021#U00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449752400,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I was the chairman of the DCS for an interim period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000021#U00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1449752400,"counter":434,"content":"<p>Ms Sheridan was chairman of the companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000021#U00600","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449752400,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000021#U00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1449752400,"counter":436,"content":"<p>Ms Sheridan would have more knowledge than most people in this room because she were at the coalface of every one of these projects or management systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000021#U00800","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449752400,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000021#U00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1449752400,"counter":438,"content":"<p>What is her view on this?

We had that discussion a couple of months ago.  As it stands, we already have an Ombudsman for Children.  Deputy Daly's proposal, as far as I understand it, is made up of two parts.  The first is that he sees an ombudsman for education being active in giving policy advice.  The second function he envisages is not so much an ombudsman function as an appeals board function to allow for the making of determining decisions, which ombudsmen typically do not do.  We talked through those concepts with the Deputy, as I said.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is advancing the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015 but, as the Minister indicated earlier this week, it is highly unlikely that it will be passed before the end of the current Oireachtas term.  In the admissions area, we wish to put in place enhanced regulation both in terms of the time applications are made to schools, which would provide clarity for everybody, and in respect of what might or might not be included in enrolment policy.  That, in essence, is what is involved in the legislation.  The Minister has signalled her view that there is a need to review the Equal Status Act provisions around denominational education.  The Bill has been published but not discussed in the Houses, so it is technically on First Stage.  The Minister has indicated that it was her intention to introduce amendments to provide for a parents' and students' charter, which, together with the new arrangements around enrolment, should remove enrolment to a significant extent from any necessary appeals mechanisms.<\/p>  <p>  We would like to advance those initiatives and analyse their impact without putting a straight appeals mechanism in place which would have a determining say in schools' enrolment policies.  That is the issue we are focusing on in our emerging discussion with Deputy Daly.  We hope the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill will be taken in the next Oireachtas, in which case there will be further opportunities to consider the concept Deputy Daly has proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000024#X02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1449754200,"counter":638,"content":"<p>I take it from what Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is saying that, in a different way, the Department is putting together a type of appeals structure or mechanism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015121000024#X02600","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449754200,"counter":639,"content":"<p>In a different way, we are seeking to have these sorts of issues addressed in the first instance via the cultural aspect, with a view to ensuring schools are more responsive and transparent in their communities, with an opportunity also for appeals mechanisms.

I welcome to the meeting Mr. Gordon Jeyes, chief executive of Tusla, who is joined by Mr. Fred McBride, chief operations officer, Mr. Pat Smyth, director of finance, and Mr. Cormac Quinlan, interim director of policy and strategy.  I also welcome Ms Sue Kane, the project manager of Tusla, who is in the Public Gallery.  They all are welcome and I thank them for being here.<\/p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Senator Imelda Henry and Deputies Billy Kelleher and Sandra McLellan.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that mobile telephones should be turned off for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment, which affects the recording of the meeting and the staff.<\/p> <p>  This is the first part of our meeting, the second part of which is the meeting with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I thank members for their agreement to switch the meeting around to accommodate the Minister.  This meeting is one of the committee's regular meetings with Tusla to discuss the ongoing work commitment of the agency.  On what probably could be his last occasion with us, I thank Mr. Jeyes in advance for his work, commitment and dedication since he took up the job.  He has been a good friend to this committee.  I note Mr. Jeyes has announced his intention to step down.  On my behalf and on behalf of the committee, I thank him for his work.  We will not wish him well yet in his retirement but we hope he will have a pleasant and active retirement.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin with Mr. Jeyes's opening statement, I will remind witnesses about privilege.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice and rulings of the Chair to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I invite Mr. Jeyes to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#C00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449746100,"counter":779,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to update the committee.  I am well aware that it is a busy time of year but it is a good time of year to tell the committee about the progress of this year.  We are in the midst of completing our business plan for 2016 and, therefore, the views of members are welcome.  I can summarise it in five words - much done, more to do.<\/p> <p>  We take this opportunity to talk about the business plan for 2015 in the first instance.  We published our corporate plan and the 2015 business plan was the first detailed statement covering the outputs and objectives of that plan.  The first part of this report covers our progress in the first three quarters.<\/p> <p>  The child protection notification system is now available to external services that require this information, specifically An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Tusla out-of-hours emergency service, GP services and hospital accident and emergency departments.  It is a big step forward.  The national out-of-hours service is now operational, providing emergency advice and support to the Garda regarding the operation of protecting children under section 12.<\/p> <p>  We have come a long way regarding making information available.  Integrated performance reports are published quarterly on the website, covering the full range of information in terms of service delivery as well as finance, HR and quality and risk.<\/p> <p>  We have further refined our need-to-know system working in partnership with colleagues in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  We have an incident management policy, which is due to be finalised, and a revised complaints and feedback policy has been approved and the final discussions with the trade unions have satisfactorily concluded.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware, the issue of consistency has been a major feature and a national policy catalogue has been developed and it is on the Tusla web for all staff.  Each of the 17 areas has a manager who leads on participation, partnership and family support and our common assessment framer, Meitheal, is being rolled out around the country.  There has been detailed discussions with staff about a quality assurance framework.  The first work this year was on unallocated cases.  As the committee will hear, we are developing a detailed programme of quality reviews as well as performance audits for 2016.<\/p> <p>  We have pulled together all the investment of the agency in research.  A strategy has been approved by the board and an operating model for the research team and an oversight committee with external involvement has been established.<\/p> <p>  A resourcing framework for supporting parents has been agreed, co-ordinators are in place and it was launched successfully earlier this week.  The assessment consultation and therapy service is extremely important because it is the first one that follows the child, trying to ensure he or she does not finish in any type of secure establishment.  If the child does, the service stays with him or her until he or she returns to the community.  We are expanding our therapeutic services and the first expansion is the appointment of staff in the specialised field of supporting young people who exhibit sexually abusive behaviour.  An alternative care strategy is being refined.  There have been initial discussions and it will be a major undertaking in 2016.  There has been substantial work to move from handing out grants to do good work to commissioning, in line with the Government, the D&aacute;il and the agency's priorities.  There is now full national oversight of all services relating to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.<\/p><p>There has been an increase in that investment, which will continue.<\/p><p> Family resource centres are a key part of many communities and fully participate in our service delivery framework.  An integrated management structure in education has been designed and the process to have three national lead managers covering the full range of our education activity is currently in process.  There has been a review of the school completion programme following the ESRI report.  The strength of local initiatives is celebrated but we must complement that with good governance.  There have been detailed and excellent conversations with school completion chairpersons and co-ordinators in recent weeks.  Early years inspection now runs a full national system.  Gaps are being covered and the national structure is fully in place.  It will benefit from further investment in 2016.<\/p><p> The final output relates to whether Tusla is a credible and fit-for-purpose organisation.  We have much more information.  An estates strategy and property audit have been completed and we have a programme of capital works.  A risk register has been developed at all levels of the organisation.  There has been initial discussion at the board and it will continue to review it.  There has been detailed work and discussion on financial controls, and in particular on the governance arrangements with the wide range of externally funded agencies.  As budgets improve we are beginning to put the emphasis back on training and to ensure that managers have the support they need regarding performance management, legal framework and leadership.  Recruitment has been identified as a major issue.  As a consequence, and to produce competition with the national recruitment service, we established Tusla Recruit so we can speed up these processes.  A head of legal services has been appointed and there have been productive and constructive discussions with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to expand Tusla legal services further.<\/p><p> As matters stood at the end of the third quarter this year, there are still concerns about the national child care information system.  It is fully operational and there is much learning from front-line practice with the developer.  We wish to speed up the roll-out and discussions on that matter continue between Fred McBride and ICT control in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is ongoing work involving the mother and baby homes inquiry in the Department, the Adoption Authority and ourselves to ensure there is clear co-operation about adoption records and improving our information tracing systems.  Discussions with the HSE continue regarding the best way for Tusla to fulfil its responsibilities for psychological welfare services for families.<\/p><p> Additional external support and a strategic partner for ICT are currently being procured, but there are still issues regarding our essential dependency on HSE arrangements.  This is not just a matter of investment.  Clearly, we share the network for servers so issues of network hosting and development of our applications are important.  That remains under-funded and ill-defined.<\/p><p> I will continue very quickly so members can deal with their issues of concern.  On the back of an improved financial settlement for 2016 which addresses some of the inherited legacy deficits, a business plan under the Minister's direction in the performance statement is in preparation.  This will be the second year in our corporate plan.  Key issues will be addressed and it will be submitted later this month.  The first issue, which is crucial and of great significance culturally, is the commencement and implementation of the revised Children First guidelines.  A national implementation team has been established under Cormac Quinlan, the director of policy and strategy, to ensure readiness for mandated reporting systems and responses, information and guidance for others carrying out this work, training and e-learning, and the full range of information and advice.<\/p><p> Second is a legislative response to the work in after-care, particularly our responsibility for those young people in education and training.  There is also advice and advocacy.  Advocacy is crucial to ensure these young adults are getting the health, housing, training and support required.  The first steps on a clear national policy are there and we are prepared to ensure that the right of every young person to an after-care plan is in place.<\/p><p> In addition, we are getting ready for the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  We have three working groups making sure there is full public awareness, the assessment of compelling reasons and the establishment of the adoption information register.<\/p><p> There is also a detailed plan to examine the resource deficits, the so-called unallocated cases, and to ensure the time is significantly reduced from first referral and monitoring to the allocation of a social worker for assessment and support.  We will progress the national incident management system and that will be available for scrutiny.  The quality assurance directorate has launched \"Tell Us\" at Tusla, the national management system, and innovative methodologies for service users.  We must do more about responding to what our complaints are telling us in policy terms and feedback from our customers.<\/p><p> We must examine standardising policy.  The child protection and welfare handbook was distributed throughout the country.  I still see well-thumbed copies.  That was a success five years ago, but it is time for it to be reviewed and updated.  We must build on the work supported by Atlantic Philanthropies in partnership and family support, to ensure we are working with parents in support of their children and that the early intervention of Meitheal is used as well as the audit tool for parents.  Research is continuing to make sure it is in line with our priorities.  A quality assurance framework will examine historical allegations, the child protection notification system and our child protection and welfare and children in care services to assess the impact they have.  It will not just look at the data.<\/p><p> We must do further work at the children and young people services committees.  We must ensure our support for children in care is genuinely multi-disciplinary and multi-agency.  We must work with the Department of Education and Skills in the tracking of school performance and with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure there is immunisation and health and dental checks.  The alternative care strategy must pick up pace.  We will produce a children in care to adoption handbook.  We will establish a commissioning support unit and a clear commissioning cycle.  The priorities established for domestic, sexual and gender based violence include implementation of governance, a standard reporting framework and our contribution to the multi-departmental work as set out in the Istanbul Convention.<\/p><p> We must follow through on our discussions and conversations to build on the community strengths of the school completion programme and ensure there is an integrated approach to educational welfare, home school liaison and school completion.  We must ensure that education as a component of every child's right to achieve their potential is fully developed in the service delivery framework.  The early years inspectorate will be developed with further investment, a central registration office will be established when the regulation comes in at the end of the first quarter and an ICT system will be developed to ensure our inspections are intelligence driven.  Importantly, we have just concluded a review of section 14, that is, the work with parents who choose to educate their children elsewhere, including at home in many instances or in non-recognised schools.  The participation and achievement in education of children in care will involve specific initiatives.  It is of crucial importance.  Children will often do well when in care in terms of their education, but there are gaps where they fall behind.<\/p><p> Finally, there are specific things we must do to strengthen ourselves as fit-for-purpose.  Establishing Tusla legal services will mean we have some contestability with our private sector legal providers and better work between social work and lawyers so we are supporting judges and the courts system efficiently and effectively.  We must strengthen our corporate infrastructure to ensure we are effective, efficient and responsive.<\/p><p>In detailed discussions about the structure which involved face-to-face meetings with over 25% of staff, it was clear that significant concerns remain regarding how we support the front line in terms of ICT and HR.  As referred to already, discussions continue.  There will be further meetings this month with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the HSE regarding psychology; estate strategy, particularly the major investment in the special care estate that is planned for next year; and our value for taxpayer money strategy.  Work has started and will continue to ensure that risk management policy is an active process, not just a box-filling exercise.  We have made substantial progress on resource allocation because, having been disaggregated from the health service, the amount of money invested in children's services could vary hugely across the country.  Major reforms are also being made in HR with regard to training needs and work with the national joint council.<\/p><p> When the Child and Family Agency was established, it was important for the governance of services for children because there was now to be no hiding place.  I am confident that in challenging circumstances a strong beginning has been made and there has been good progress.  There is a clear agenda for the next phase of reform.  I will finish as I began: much done, a lot more still to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":782,"content":"<p>That was a famous catchphrase.

I thank Mr. Jeyes and his colleagues for coming before us today and for giving us a breakdown of the plans and proposals and some of the work that has been ongoing in Tusla since its formation.  I am not going to make any comments except to ask a few questions, which the witnesses will hopefully be able to answer.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Jeyes is on record in the past as having said Tusla was underfunded for the services it is required to provide.  Does he consider the additional &euro;38 million that has been secured in budget 2016 to be adequate not simply to stand still but to provide the services Tusla was established to provide?  Bearing in mind that the Children First legislation and the aftercare legislation has since gone through the D&aacute;il, placing additional statutory obligations on the agency, does he regard the &euro;38 million as adequate?  In terms of one of his core obligations, when Tusla was established, one cited obligation was to investigate all child protection and abuse claims in a timely manner.  Just last month, the new Ombudsman for Children revealed serious deficiencies in the child protection and care system administered by Tusla.  Mr. Muldoon found that Tusla managed to deal with just one fifth of all reports of child abuse in a timely manner last year.  Can Mr. Jeyes comment on that?  Can he indicate how many files remain unassessed at present?  Has he a full complement of social workers?  Can he confirm that he will be in a position in future to ensure that all referrals will be assessed in a timely manner?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Jeyes came before us earlier in this year to discuss a particular problem regarding unassessed files in the Laois-Offaly region.  Perhaps he might use today to update us on where that investigation stands.  At the time, he highlighted the absence of an appropriate IT system for Tusla.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I think he said it was still operating under the IT system of the HSE, perhaps through a service-level agreement.  In his report today he talks about a new IT system on a pilot basis.  Perhaps he could update us on where that stands.<\/p> <p>  Regarding early years inspections, Mr. Jeyes said he now has inspectors to inspect early years settings across all geographical locations.  Can he confirm under what process these inspections are being carried out?  Following the \"Prime Time\" expos&eacute; a few years ago, a new registration system was to be established and new regulations were to be published.  That still has not happened.  Perhaps he could update us on what regulations the inspections are being carried out under and why it is that, almost three years later, the promised regulations have not been published and the new registration process has not been implemented across all regions.  I am told that it may be implemented on a voluntary basis by some of the regions, but perhaps he could update us on that.<\/p> <p>  He spoke about some of the grants Tusla pays out to various schemes, such as the family resource centres, the school completion programme, domestic violence services and other such services.  The evidence over the last few years is that there seems to be a reduction in the emphasis placed by Mr. Jeyes's organisation on the good works being carried out by these organisations.  I am thinking of the family resource centres.  I met with a delegation from family resource centres in the summer gone by and one person described the funding cuts over the last three years as simply unbearable.  They removed their capacity to deal with what they were established to do, namely, early intervention and preventing a crisis occurring in family settings.  They described waiting for their funding announcement as being like having an axe over one's head because one never quite knows what is going to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#E00300","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":784,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#E00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":785,"content":"<p>I also referred previously to a women's refuge centre in Mullingar which received a letter one day to say its funding had been cut for the coming year because the service being provided is being reviewed and domestic abuse services for women in the midlands are being streamlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#E00500","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":786,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#E00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":787,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Jeyes think it is fair that these organisations are under review and that funding streams to them are being cut before the review is complete, not taking on board the good work they are doing in their communities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#E00700","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":788,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Jeyes and his colleagues here this morning.  I recognise that a considerable body of work has been carried out since the establishment of Tusla.  That is without question.  We are all conscious of the restrictions on funding and resources and the impact that can have in terms of how much further the Tusla team would like to be at this point in time.  We can only hope that funding stream will improve and that much of what is yet to be done can be advanced significantly in the coming year.  I am still very concerned about the appointment of social workers in cases where a social worker is required.<\/p><p>In response to one of the questions I submitted for consideration at this meeting I have been advised that Tusla only has figures in regard to the social worker appointments.  These show that a staggering 5,585 children are waiting more than a month for the appointment of a social worker.  Within that number there are children classified as high risk; those awaiting child protection conferences, subject to child protection plan; court proceedings; children in care with non-approved carers; children in care less than six months in unstable placement; and young persons at high risk, including mental health and anti-social behaviour.  Of these there are 1,087 waiting more than a month for the appointment of a social worker.  It is a serious fact.  I am not pointing a finger of failure or an accusatorial point at Tusla in regard to this.<\/p><p> I would like Mr. Jeyes to share with us his and Tusla's view as to how this can be properly addressed and how we can reach a situation where we do not have what I would regard as inordinate delays.  There are 3,504 children, of varying degrees of need - high, medium and low - who are waiting more than three months.  We do not know how far beyond three months many of those might be waiting; 606 of those are high.  To my mind, certainly in the high risk category, that is absolutely unacceptable, even if the number was only six, never mind 606.  There has to be a realisation on the part of those who control the purse strings, those who make the decisions in terms of the resourcing of Tusla, that there would be recruitment of the required complement of social workers in order that Tusla can carry out its work effectively and efficiently.  I highlight those facts as advised to me in response to questions I posed in advance of today's meeting.<\/p><p> In regard to Mr. Jeyes' address to us at the start of the meeting, I note with some concern that despite ongoing discussions with the HSE regarding Tusla's legal responsibilities for a psychology service that no progress has been made.  That is absolutely unacceptable.  As an Oireachtas Member I use the opportunity to say to the HSE that it is wake-up time here as this is not acceptable.  Tusla has a responsibility to have such a service in place.  I find it incredible that at this point in time following the establishment of Tusla, there has not been a resourcing transfer in order for that to be carried out.<\/p><p> In regard to the revision of the national after-care policy, Mr. Jeyes mentioned preparing for new statutory provisions to allow for all eligible young people the statutory right of an after-care plan.  I presume new statutory provisions will require new legislation.  If that is the case will he so advise?  What progress has been made in regard to the preparation for new statutory provisions?  I am very anxious to know about that.  I believe that all eligible young people should have a statutory right to an after-care plan.  <\/p><p> I wish Mr. Jeyes well in moving on from his current position.  I was  surprised when the matter was first highlighted.  I understand that today is closing date for applications to replace him.  I had already said to colleagues before he came him that this is their moment and they need to make some fast moves if they wish to be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#E00800","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":790,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy indicating that he is applying for the post?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#F00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":791,"content":"<p>No, certainly not.  I am going to leave it in the hands of the electorate when it comes to it.<\/p> <p>  In the entirety of all that Mr. Jeyes has said here this morning, I am being careful in what I say, as quite correctly the focus is on the children.  I understand the referencing in regard to management but I have to raise with him a matter of concern.  It gives me no pleasure to do so because I have had incidents of staff concerns within Tusla in regard to the regime within Tusla itself.  There are those in the child care sector who have felt that the regime was less than caring of the role and work of people who have given a lifetime of service to the sector.  I feel it would be remiss of me not to make reference to it.  In paragraph 1.5, output 5, Mr. Jeyes referred to leadership development programmes.  Leadership development programmes must include - there is no reference to this in anything he said this morning or in the responses we have received - the state of the organisation, the sense of a team and the sense of being appreciated and valued within Tusla.  I note among the key requirements for the role the reference, \"including the capacity to engage staff\".  If there were only one or two cases I would not be making the point here today.  Sadly and regrettably, I have to say I have had a number of people contact me, some currently in service, others who have taken the decision to leave or felt that they were compelled to leave.  What is the current state of the staff relationship within Tusla?  I ask this because it is clear that we need people who feel comfortable, appreciated and valued within their roles if they are to perform to the level we expect of them in catering to the needs of the most vulnerable of our children.  There is an issue there.  I do not know what has caused it or why it is the case but it is an issue that needs to be addressed.  I ask that whoever is replacing Mr. Jeyes would note my comments here today that we do not want an unhappy camp in terms of Tusla going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#F00300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":792,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates.  I will take up one or two points in the statement by Mr. Jeyes and then deal with some other issues.  I welcome the fact that the child protection notification system is available to external services and the operation of the national out-of-hours service, which is something that many individuals and organisations have been calling for.  It is good that it is commencing and clearly we will monitor it.<\/p><p>I join with my colleagues on the issue of the psychologists.  I echo what Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said in regard to sending a message from the committee to the HSE that it is unacceptable.  I would welcome an update but I have a feeling of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu <\/i>because the last time the witnesses appeared before the committee spoke very similar words.  Perhaps we can discuss how to progress it.  Is there something the committee can do because it is unacceptable that children do not have access to psychological services in the way they should?<\/p><p>I would welcome input on the pressure from the legal system for court orders for assessments.  This is appropriate, but will it use up the resources available and affect our ability to reach children at an early stage and provide early support for psychological services for children, mothers and mothers-to-be?  These are equally important, so how are we to balance these and ensure this area is resourced?  Like Deputy Troy, I am interested to hear more about the IT system mentioned on Tusla's last visit here.<\/p><p> In regard to the Children First Act, the after-care and other legislation that has come before us, how ready is Tusla for these and has it the resources to implement them?  Has it engaged with other agencies and bodies that are vital to helping it deliver on this legislation?  Some issues related to the Children First Act, such as education, teachers and the health system, are not within the purview of Tusla, yet it will be asked for support in these areas.  Tusla is smaller than the other bodies, yet it has the lead role on the legislation.  I want to ensure we send out the appropriate messages.  I welcome the launch the other day of a programme on parenting supports.  The abolition of corporal punishment came in through the Children First Act, and it is good to see resources are available for parents.<\/p><p> On the issue of adoption information and tracing, we have had committee hearings and the committee has produced reports.  Mr. Jeyes cited the issue of \"compelling reasons\" for non-disclosure.  The committee is still trying to identify what could be a \"compelling reason\".  I was not happy with the example given to us by the interim national manager of the adoption services.  We were given the example of what was termed \"distress\" and \"stress\" but I do not see these as compelling reasons and committee members agreed with me in that regard.  I would like to hear more from Tusla on this.<\/p><p> I was happy with the response on how the awareness plan will be developed.  I believe our committee, particularly Deputies, could play a role in examining the plan and providing an input, given it is to be rolled out nationwide.  The development in regard to legal services is very welcome.  We often hear about high legal costs and questions about what we can do about them.  Should this committee be considering legislation in that regard or has Tusla got to the stage of considering that yet?  I am concerned about costs but I am also concerned that we must ensure children and families get the legal support they need as they go through the system.  How are we to manage this?   The issue of social workers arose in the child care law reporting project.  What training is available for them regarding particular aspects of the Child Care Act?  What is Tusla doing to prepare social workers for preparing for and reporting in courts?  Is work being done on this?<\/p><p> There is inconsistency across the country in regard to engagement with external bodies, whether one is looking at the courts system or the Garda.  This inconsistency is a particular concern in regard to safety and protection orders.  Dublin may have more cases so people have more experience in this area and therefore have greater influence.  I have come across a number of inconsistencies around the country. <\/p><p> I am very conscious of children's rights and wish to raise the issue of the child care law reporting project.   Tusla is the Child and Family Agency and must be aware this report highlighted the need for greater engagement on parental support.  A major concern I have is that the greater number of court care cases involve Traveller families and families of children with intellectual difficulties.  What is the agency doing to support vulnerable parents?  The launch of the report highlighted a number of issues showing parents were extremely vulnerable.  Often the risk to a child may be low grade but the situation for a family can often escalate quite quickly thereby exposing the child to greater risk.<\/p><p> I have concerns about direct provision but because of the lack of time I will leave that in order to discuss the issue of homelessness and how the agency engages on that.  I have a serious concern but I do not believe it is the role of the agency to sort out that concern.  However, the agency has some role to play.  Homeless children are being placed in hotels but staff and guests in those hotels are not vetted.  I understand this practice would not be acceptable in the United Kingdom.  Is it acceptable that we put children in inappropriate accommodation or in housing, such as modular housing?  Has Tusla been consulted about these provisions or about how these units are designed?  Has it been asked about how accommodation can be designed to meet the needs of children?  We should look at these issues.  The agency has an expertise and a role to play regarding homeless children and families.  Therefore, when considering the issue of homelessness, we should ensure the agency has a role and engages and uses the expertise it has developed.<\/p><p> Many of my questions relate to how we can develop the agency, now it has taken its first steps.  How do we ensure it takes solid steps in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#F00400","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":794,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Jeyes for the work he has done while with the agency and for the progress that has been made.  I note the budget for the coming year has been increased and this is a result of producing results over the past 12 months.  I welcome the recognition of that work through the increased budget.<\/p> <p>  My main concern relates to young people who drop out of school.  We seem to have fallen into a dilemma where the funding for projects that cater for children who have dropped out of school has fallen between a number of stools, between the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Skills, with nobody actually taking responsibility.  The issue I raised over 12 months ago has not been resolved and the centre in question is now catering for 45 young people, some of whom were referred by the school attendance officers, yet no funding is being provided.  This was brought home to me when I saw the report on Oberstown this morning.  The cost of providing the service to someone admitted to Oberstown is over &euro;350,000 per annum per person.<\/p> <p>  The centre I have spoken about is keeping people out of places like Oberstown but has no funding.  This is a gap in our system.  If schools that have from 25 to 30 students in a class have a disruptive student and are unable to deal with that student, the student is put out of school.  Often, left to swim for themselves, these students fall into the gap because while there is an agency there to look after them, that agency is not getting the appropriate and required level of funding.  The agency I refer to gets funding of just &euro;47,500 from the Department of Education.  It was set up over 13 years ago, but there has been no progress made in regard to it although I have had contact with the Minister and the Departments of Education and Justice about the issue.  This is not the only place in the country where this is happening, where young people who are falling out of the education system find there is no adequate system in place to deal with them.  I am disappointed we have made no progress on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#G00200","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":795,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Burke on that issue, because he is referring to a very good facility in Cork.<\/p><p>What are the plans for the spending of the extra budget allocation, particularly in regard to the Children First Act and aftercare?

I will address each point in the order received.  At the beginning I said there was no hiding place, and it is good for children's services that Tusla has to come to this committee to give an account; it is not part of the HSE megalith.  There is even less of a hiding place in 2016 because of the funding made available.  This has happened, in part, because Tusla established its credibility and has a clear database upon which it based the budget that was presented to Government.  There has been a very constructive response to the under-funding and a number of issues can be addressed.  Tusla presented a three year strategy, because one cannot change everything at once, and in the main the Government has responded to a request for year one.  Once that is done there will be further budget pressures needed for 2017 and beyond.  Tusla will have to make that case based on the success of the 2016 programme.  This applies especially to Children First because while we can look to other countries and the impact of mandated reporters and reporting there, we will not know until it operates here.  To a great extent Ireland already has mandatory reporting because of the efficient way it is done in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, so it is elements of that process which are being taken forward.  It ties in with how we are going to address the unsatisfactory level of what we refer to as unallocated cases.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made reference to aftercare plans.  We are ready for aftercare plans and we have a much more consistent policy on the supports for all young people who are in education and training, which is Tusla's responsibility.  Due to the scourge of youth unemployment, we as a society have to do more to support these young people who are not in education and training, be it further adult education or practical assistance.  These are young adult citizens of the State who need championing in accessing housing, health services, training and necessary employment.  It is not about Tusla providing a second class service, it is about making sure there are sufficient after-care workers and plans to give these young people a sense of hope and to enable them access the services to which they are entitled.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the Ombudsman's report.  There is a difficulty with all these reports and scrutiny - we are at this committee today, with my colleagues from HIQA this afternoon and we will meet with the Department of Health tomorrow -  in that the report referred to Tusla data which was more than a year out of date.  There is a more detailed issue in what is meant by \"in a timely manner\", in how that is subscribed and in the way referrals are dealt with.  This is why Tusla is introducing meitheal, why we seek to divert and why we are seeking to ensure that all contacts with Tusla are responded to efficiently, effectively and proportionately.<\/p> <p>  I will address the figures in more detail when I come to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's questions since he quoted the figures.  The issue has improved and will improve further in detailed and specified ways during 2016.<\/p> <p>  The complement of social workers is kept much more up to date than was heretofore the case.  Posts on maternity leave are replaced and while the appointments wait to be filled, if agency staff are available they can go in.  We do, absolutely, need to get to the stage where all referrals are responded to.  There are some local recruitment difficulties in the more remote areas.  For example, we are currently running a more specific and bespoke recruitment campaign for Sligo.  My colleague Mr. Fred McBride will update the committee on the situation in the midlands. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449746100,"counter":797,"content":"<p>With regard to the Laois-Offaly area there was a significant backlog of cases that were reported to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and to the Minister.  We were not entirely sure of the status of that backlog regarding priority and levels of risk associated with the cases.  Using a rapid improvement methodology a team blitzed the backlog in a short period of time.  It made decisions on which cases required allocation for ongoing, longer-term work, which cases could be closed off as they did not meet the thresholds for referral, and which cases required further assessment beyond initial screening.  I have since reported to the Minister that the backlog is now dealt with.<\/p> <p>  All of the cases from the backlog that required allocation have been allocated.  Cases that required further assessment beyond initial screening have been allocated to a social worker.  There were just over 100 cases of retrospective allegations regarding adults.

Tusla is looking at developing a national child care information service which is being piloted in Limerick and the mid-west.  That has gone well and the practical wisdom of the front line is influencing the software.  It needs to be rolled out faster.  Discussions are ongoing, but as members are aware we have to pass certain controls, with deeper ICT control within that.  However, to host such a new development as the child care information service Tusla needs more ICT support.  We are still completely dependent upon HSE servers, networks and hosting.  This is just a fact of life and no amount of investment, not least because of shared premises, will move us from that.  The level of service we get is not proportionate to the level of activity that Tusla had when it was part of the HSE, which I sometimes characterise as 5%, but I would say that.  It is actually a bit less than 5%, I am rounding up in the interests of children.  It has been said to me in writing that in its last year as part of the HSE, Tusla received less than half of 1% of the HSE total ICT service and support and therefore that is what we should expect.  Further discussions are happening with the Departments and with the HSE to find a way out of that.  It is not just about resourcing.  As with the other one or two issues I have raised with the committee today, I cannot do much more about this and it needs to be resolved at an interdepartmental level.  Someone needs to make a call on it.  They could call it by saying \"Mr. Jeyes is wrong\" but those issues, as the Deputy has rightly described, have been drawn to his attention a few times.  The ICT issue must be resolved.

The work we do through health business services, on which Mr. Smyth leads, is going well, as is payroll and processing.  There is much more of a customer orientation and Tusla is treated as a customer the same way a hospital group or community health partnership would be.<\/p> <p>  The next issue raised by Deputy Troy concerned registration and regulation for the early years scheme and how long it has taken.  While I want to say I agree with everything the Minister and his departmental officials will say this afternoon, this is a matter for them.  The timing of the introduction of the regulations and the registration system is an issue for the Department.  My understanding is that it will be introduced at the end of the first quarter but the Department can answer the Deputy's critique this afternoon.<\/p> <p>  I understand that there is an impression that we consider grants less important, but that is not the case.  This year we invested &euro;142 million in various outsourced services.  We do this because they are more flexible, closer to the community and can provide value for money.  These services have been more vulnerable to reductions during the recession because we have had to focus on the core issues of child protection and school attendance, for example.<\/p> <p>  We need to have a review of family resource centres.  The work in many of these centres is outstanding but there will be a review because there have been many changes since they were first established more than a decade ago.  Some of them face enormous pressure, not least from new multi-ethnic Ireland, and do a terrific job.  For others, perhaps, the demands are now not so great.  There was no reduction in 2015 and there will not be a reduction in 2016 but we need to examine their effectiveness and the support and contribution they make.  We are having detailed discussions with them on the contribution they will make when we deal with refugee resettlement.<\/p> <p>  In 2015, Tusla spent more on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence than it did in the previous year.  I accept that part of the criticism, which is correct, is that we are slow to conclude discussions.  The business of concluding discussions regarding our service plan took too long last year.  This has been acknowledged and we need to ensure we get in and have constructive discussions with the Department and the Minister.  Although there were no reductions, I hear there were some movements within the budget to ensure we were getting a better spread of services and that people who were being abused were getting a response.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in spoke about recruitment and it was raised at a later point of the session.  Along with ICT, it was one of the biggest issues arising from our consultation.  It was clear there were reservations about the way in which the national recruitment service worked.  It was designed for a particular time and everyone in the health service and the children's service sees its need for reform.  We also seek to add pressure to that reform by setting up Tusla Recruit in order that we can find ways of speeding up the process and that every social work vacancy is filled in the fastest possible time.<\/p> <p>  We now have a clear database and, during the summer and autumn, I was open and clear in stating that, on our present budget, we could not deal with the issues identified by our quality review of unallocated cases.  I accept the Deputy's points that it is unacceptable and we need to examine this further.  I hear very clearly his correct listing of what is high risk.  Decisions are made within that because the 5,585 figure includes the 1,087 high-risk cases.  Some of these categories would be attended to and all are reviewed while awaiting a fuller assessment.  We need to get better at this and I fully expect, through intervention strategies and additional resources in the region of &euro;6 million, to make considerable progress and there should not be an issue with unallocated cases by 2017.  As an agency, we got to the stage of being able to state the case objectively and clearly and the Government has responded, which is welcome.<\/p> <p>  Discussions continue within the Department about psychology and I will have further discussions with the national director for primary care in this regard.  I would be derelict in my duties if I did not mention these issues although I am conscious that I have been here, said it and done it before.  It remains unresolved and we need to conclude it.<\/p> <p>  I have covered the issues raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in regarding aftercare.  There will be a plan for each child.  As a society, we need to look out for those who are particularly vulnerable, being those who are not in education or learning or training programmes.  Ireland's statistics for that cohort are very impressive.  The support provided to them, either through grants, SUSI or ourselves, is very good.  The countries of the United Kingdom are only now catching up with the notion that children who remain in education should be allowed to stay in foster care.  This has always been the practice in Ireland and is something that should be celebrated.<\/p> <p>  It was no surprise to me to come to the end of my contract.  Age catches up with us all.  There is no more of a story to it.  We have been involved in an improvement journey.  When I first arrived I said I hoped to bring some evidence-based impatience.  The task has been onerous and the workload huge, and much of the success of Tusla has been generated through the enormous effort, willpower and goodwill of staff.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting to put the members' challenge together with observations made later about the difficulties we have in creating consistency.  Consistency is based on best Irish practice and debate.  Sometimes there are issues within the workforce.  There can be some sort of wish to translate consistency as meaning doing something the way I or we, in a certain parish, do it.  We consult rigorously.  I met the area managers monthly, as does Mr. McBride now.  We consult at a level unheard of under any previous regime.  When we consulted on how the structure was working, we had meetings throughout the country that involved comments from and direct interaction with more than 25% of the workforce.  We also used social media to get their views.<\/p> <p>  In terms of creating a modern, accountable organisation, we stand for accountability and personal responsibility.  This has been a time of considerable change and there is always resistance to change.  We are creating a culture of consequences and a culture where staff are valued and respected.  We often speak of the values and, more important, how we translate these values into behaviours.<\/p> <p>  I hear the points being made about a number of people and I regret the way they are made.  I am a very accessible chief executive and any issue can be drawn to my attention or that of the director of human resources if it involves me.  I would describe the culture we are seeking to create as one of high challenge and high support.  It is both of these and this is appropriate for the organisation.  I do not, for a moment, duck the issue that we have been doing that in pressurised circumstances.  There has been the pressure of a financial crisis that was not of the staff's making.  At the same time, we were challenged by the Government to improve services for children.<\/p><p>There are plenty of opportunities for staff to raise individual concerns which are investigated thoroughly and independently.  We have made progress in that regard in becoming a modern organisation and I reject the way the Deputy characterised it. <\/p><p> Senator van Turnhout mentioned psychology.  We have been given legislative responsibility and it remains within primary care, which is the most important referral route because it is accessible to all but we want to make sure we are developing psychology, for the reasons the Senator mentioned, for all families.  Further developments would not be good if we finished up with responsibility for psychology for the children in difficulties while for the &ldquo;nice&rdquo; children there was another service.  The legislation has given us that responsibility and the Departments need to sort out how we can provide that universal service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449746100,"counter":809,"content":"<p>I welcome Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s comments on the cross-sectoral responsibility for the implementation of the Children First Act 2015, the agency has always been very clear about giving the message that child protection is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility.

The same applies to homelessness.  We would include that work with the work on vulnerable groups, such as the new Irish and Travellers.  We do have dedicated social workers and educational welfare workers in that area, and dealing with those who are homeless, to ensure they are advised and that we can minimise the impact of staying in hotel accommodation.<br\/><br\/>I represent the agency on the Government&rsquo;s refugee task force making sure that the strengths of direct provision are kept and the areas that proved weak are left behind, not least in making sure that the emergency reception and orientation centres, EROCs, are child-friendly environments.

We need to have further strategic discussions with the Department of Education and Skills.  There is a gap for young people who need to learn in more practical ways.

I absolutely struggle with the term &quot;non-recognised&quot; schools that is used in Ireland.  I also struggle with our role in that.  There are very significant issues involved here that we need to unpack in 2016.  We will certainly be referring in our business plan to the need for further discussions with the Department of Education and Skills in this regard.<br\/><br\/>The Chairman mentioned specific issues of budget.  There will be investment, for example, of approximately &euro;6 million in unallocated cases.  We are doing that on an objective basis because some areas were underfunded because of what was inherited from health boards and the HSE.  That money will also be used to strengthen our intervention arrangements where there has been a backlog to help staff to get back on the front foot.  Such backlogs were caused in some instances by high levels of maternity leave, which we have now resolved, or because of particularly demanding cases.  I can think of parts of the country where the service was running well but then a very demanding case involving a lot of children being taken into care at the one time pushed everything else back.  We need to intervene to help in such circumstances and there are resources available to do that.  There are also resources available to make sure we strengthen the human resources, finance, communications and quality support services provided by the organisation to the local areas.  We want services delivered at the most local level practicable within the &euro;38 million allocation, as well as meeting our current rate of expenditure.  There is funding available to address these issues.<br\/><br\/>I have already dealt with the point about human resources.  We accepted that the centre was not working but that was the hand we were dealt.  Despite that, we are developing our own systems.  I also accept the point about the mix of social work teams which is quite difficult to achieve.  We have now reached an agreement with IMPACT regarding transfers so we will not have our own staff applying for transfers through the open system and will deal with that separately.  Sometimes there is a particular problem with the mix of teams in urban areas because of the high turnover.  We find better performance in the rural areas because the teams are more settled and balanced.  <br\/><br\/>I have addressed the issue of unallocated cases.  While I completely accept Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's point that the figure of just under 6,000 is unacceptable, I would point out that at the beginning of the year that figure was over 8,000.  Even within the resources we have currently, staff have dealt with the issue well and made a magnificent contribution.

The committee has considered a number of issues relevant to my Department since.  I thank members for the keen interest shown and the added value they have brought to the process.<\/p> <p>  I would like to summarise the significant progress made on my Department's legislative programme and outline a couple of issues which I hope to progress during the remaining term of the Government.  <\/p> <p>  The draft heads and general scheme of the Adoption Information and Tracing Bill were published in July.  I received the report on the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny of the proposals last month and I am very grateful for the thorough and expeditious manner in which it carried out this work.  The report is being given very careful consideration and I have no doubt that it will make a valuable contribution to finalising this important legislation, on which I hope to consult shortly with the Attorney General and then to revert to the Government for permission to draft the Bill.<\/p> <p>  Just last week, the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2015 passed its final Stages.  It provides, for the first time, for a legal right to an aftercare plan.  I believe this legislation will be important in ensuring appropriate planning is taking place to ensure better outcomes, particularly for the most vulnerable of young people leaving care.  We also recently enacted the Children First Bill and I am now keen to progress commencing sections of the Bill at the earliest opportunity, starting with the provisions that remove the common law defence of reasonable chastisement in cases of corporal punishment.  As I signed that instrument this afternoon, as of tonight, that defence will no longer be available.<\/p> <p>  On the Oberstown centre, the Children (Amendment) Bill 2015 was enacted in July.  It provides for a range of matters in relation to children's detention, including ending permanently the practice of accommodating children in adult prisons.  The full transfer of responsibility for all 17 year olds, including those on committal, will come into force as early as possible in 2016 on completion of a programme of recruitment of care staff that is under way.  I wrote to the committee on 7 December with a detailed update and response to a range of questions it had posed.  My officials are working with stakeholders to develop a consultation process with children around the Gender Recognition Act, while I have signed regulations on entries in the register of intercountry adoptions.  We have an excellent group of individuals in the Department's participation unit who are organising this work which has to be treated with tremendous sensitivity because these are very vulnerable children and young people.  We want to know what their opinions are, but we need to be prepared for any eventualiy arising from their telling of their stories.<\/p> <p>  I recently announced significant additional funding for children and families in budget 2016.  Next year my Department will have gross funding of &euro;1.137 billion, an increase of &euro;117.4 million, or 11.4%, on this year's allocation.  There are two major elements to the increase: a &euro;345 million allocation for child care, increasing the budget in this area by one third, alongside substantially increased resources for Tusla, putting the agency on a firm financial footing.  The youth sector will also benefit from additional resources next year.  Tusla&rsquo;s financial sustainability is further bolstered by the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;15 million for the Vote of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in 2015.  These additional funds, with savings in other areas, will enable Tusla to deal with some legacy issues alongside current cost pressures.  This very significant allocation of additional funds to my Department is testament to the commitment the Government has demonstrated to reforming and improving services for children and families.  We are investing additional funds strategically during the early years and bringing a much stronger focus on intervening early to prevent problems arising or escalating in order that Ireland will become a better and safer place in which to grow up.<\/p><p>In July, I published the report of the interdepartmental group on future investment in child care, which identifies a framework for developing affordable, high-quality and accessible child care.  The group's work was informed by evidence and best practice, alongside extensive consultation with stakeholders, including parents and child care providers.  The Government took the first steps to implementing that roadmap in budget 2016.<br\/><br\/>By increasing the child care budget in my Department by a third, budget 2016 will provide for a number of important improvements.  From September 2016, every child will be entitled to free preschool care from age three until they start primary school or up to age five and a half.  To ensure children can benefit as early as possible, they will be able to join free preschool at three different points in the year rather than at one at present.  In line with that development, I have announced &euro;17 million in funding for a new model of supports for children with disabilities in mainstream preschools in order that all children can benefit from high-quality preschooling.  The new model offers seven different levels of support, based on each child's needs.  About 7,500 children are expected to benefit in a full year.  As a father who had a child who overcame great challenges with disability, I believe this is a very important measure and one of which I am particularly proud.<br\/><br\/>I have announced funding to increase the availability of affordable child care by providing an extra 8,000 places under the community child care subvention scheme.  For the first time, these places will also be available to private child care providers in order that more parents have access to more affordable child care.  We are also working on the development of an affordable child care programme &ndash; a single subsidy to replace the confusing and sometimes inefficient array of targeted subsidies currently in place.  We know they are confusing because in some areas the uptake is not what it should be.  I have provided capital funding to incentivise the greater provision of after-school care options on school premises.  These measures, while not a comprehensive solution in and of themselves, represent a concrete step towards the high-quality, affordable and accessible child care we want for our children at every stage of their development.<br\/><br\/>Reforming child and family services has been a high priority of the Government.  Tusla is less than two years in existence but I believe we have made good progress during that time.  For 2016, I have been able to increase Tusla's budgetary allocation by &euro;38 million, which is an increase of over 5%.  These additional resources for 2015 build on the extra &euro;28 million in current funding and &euro;5.5 million in capital funding that I secured for Tusla in budget 2015.  I believe that, effectively managed, the agency now has the level of base funding needed to put its services on a sustainable footing and, critically, to address particular areas of identified need and risk.<br\/><br\/>The 2016 provision includes development funding to support additional services, especially those targeting areas of unmet need and risk.  As with committee members, I was deeply concerned about the number of children in respect of whom there were concerns about welfare or child protection or both who did not have an allocated social worker.  I asked Tusla to carry out an audit of such cases nationally and to develop a business case on how to address the problem.  The additional funding allocated to Tusla will allow the agency to recruit around 400 extra staff next year, including social workers and essential support staff, to progress the solution to this very troubling issue.  In addition, I am funding a national out-of-hours social service to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a dedicated intervention team for urgent cases, the implementation of the Istanbul convention on violence against women and domestic violence, and improvements to Tusla's organisational structure.  On 20 November, I issued a performance statement to Tusla setting out my priorities for 2016.  I met Tusla's board on 27 November to urge it to continue the strong progress made over the past two years and to assure it of my continued support for its endeavours.  Under the legislation, Tusla's business plan for 2016 is due by 20 December, which is in ten days.<br\/><br\/>In October, I published Ireland's first national youth strategy, setting out the Government's plan to ensure young people achieve the five high-level outcomes set out in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, namely, that they are active and healthy, achieving, safe, economically secure, and connected and respected.  The strategy was based on extensive consultation, including with approximately 4,000 young people.  This is an important milestone.  With collective effort, implementing this strategy will help more young people to flourish and reach their potential.<br\/><br\/>I announced a youth employability initiative designed to meet the needs of young people who are not in education, employment or training, NEETs, and who are most at risk of long-term unemployment.  The initiative is intended to support innovation in addressing the needs of these young people, particularly by developing relevant skills and competencies.  The &euro;600,000 available for the initiative in 2016 should benefit an estimated 200 to 300 young people.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I had the pleasure of attending the D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g event in Croke Park along with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, at the end of November.  When I attend events such as this, it gives me a great sense of encouragement for the future to see and feel the energy and fresh thinking our young people bring.  I was able to inform the assembled group that, from this year onwards, whatever Department is responsible for the topic under discussion in future sessions of D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g will have its Minister in attendance and will support the work of the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g national executive.  This is the part of the mechanism to support Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and is a significant change in the way decisions made by young people at D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g will be progressed.  It recognises the importance of listening to young people and acting on what they say.  Everybody involved benefited from the session.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>At the end of October, I appointed a new board for the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  The appointments were made following an open process, fully in accordance with Government guidelines.  I was pleased to reappoint Dr. Geoffrey Shannon as chairman.

I will try to contribute in the good spirit of the Minister when he concluded his presentation.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Jeyes was before us this morning and highlighted the alarming issue of the IT support Tusla is receiving from the HSE.  I am not in any way criticising the Minister but I believe he needs to intervene.  Tusla is receiving support in the region of 0.5% but it needs this to be increased to 5%.  Intervention is needed at a very senior level in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health to ensure Tusla is adequately supported with IT.  The Minister needs to take this on board and intervene very quickly.<\/p> <p>  I recently raised with the Minister on Question Time the capacity and expansion of the ECCE scheme, and he said he has commenced a mapping exercise.  Will  he indicate who will conduct it?  When will it be completed and what measures will be introduced to support areas where there is a deficiency in the supply of places?  In replying to a parliamentary question of mine last year, the Minister cited capacity of approximately 10,000 spaces.  The expansion of the community child care scheme alone, which it must be acknowledged is very welcome, involves an initial 8,000 places.  I genuinely fear that with the introduction of the scheme, there will be serious capacity issues in some regions, although I acknowledge there will not be in others.  What measures will the Minister take to ensure there are no capacity issues, regardless of location?<\/p> <p>  The community employees who work in community child care settings can currently form part of the ratio numbers.<\/p><p>I think that is to cease next September and they are still unaware of what supports will be put in place to help them cater for this.  I serve on the board of a community child care facility, so I know that without the community employees the facility would not be viable; we would not be able to re-hire our community employee workers as core staff.  What plans does the Minister have in place to address this for September 2016?<br\/><br\/>It is unbelievable that the 2014 independent report by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon has not been published or laid before the D&aacute;il.  I was critical of the Minister's predecessor for not publishing the report before the summer recess.  The 2015 report will be launched by the Department shortly, yet we have not had an opportunity to discuss the 2014 one.  It is an important piece of work, not just for the Minister and his Department, but also for all Members of the Oireachtas, in order to see how we can address and advance the issues of concern raised by the independent<i><\/i>rapporteur.  Perhaps the Minister can indicate when that matter will come before the D&aacute;il.<br\/><br\/>We had representatives of Tusla before the joint committee this morning.  We still do not have a full complement of social workers.  I acknowledge that we have had after care legislation, namely the Child Care (Amendment) Bill, and the Children First Bill, but those will only put added pressure on the number of social workers available.  How does the Minister intend to deal with that?<br\/><br\/>As regards the departmental supplementary budget, last week I asked the Minister to come back with an outline of how much we are spending on legal fees.  Today, Tusla said that, in 2014, &euro;38 million was spent on legal fees.  It is scandalous when 6,000 child welfare referral files remain unassessed.<br\/><br\/>I recently met a number of front-line staff working at Oberstown.  This committee had staff appearing here before the summer break.  We sent a report to the Minister but my information is that things are not getting better, rather they are getting worse.  I was given an example of a young resident of Oberstown who held the unit to ransom.  Staff were locked up in an office and the inmate, or resident, was wielding a TV bracket as a weapon.<br\/><br\/>Another young resident took a concoction of illegal substances.  Senior management refused to call garda&iacute; for back-up despite a request to do so by paramedics.  Is the Minister confident that senior management is engaging sufficiently with front-line personnel at Oberstown?  These are serious concerns.  I understand that there is a threat of industrial action and a ballot is to be taken within the next two weeks.  Greater intervention is needed to provide support to those working at the coalface.  One man told me he has been working for 30 years between Oberstown and other similar institutions, yet he never saw it as bad as it is now.  When this new campus opened, everyone - regardless of our political persuasion - thought things would get better.  None of us thought things would go into reverse.  The Minister should inform us how he intends to intervene there. <br\/><br\/>What official protocols are in place to deal with the child and adolescent mental health services, or CAMHS?  Recent figures concerning the length of time teenagers are awaiting psychological assessment are worrying.  While it is not under the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, surely there is an official protocol for dealing with this matter.<br\/><br\/>On a positive note, I compliment the Minister for introducing the special educational fund for children with disabilities who are attending the pre-school service.  It is possibly the best piece of good news announced in his Department's budget.  I have been highlighting the matter for a number of years, so I hope it will be quickly rolled out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#T00300","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":841,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for their presentations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#U00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":842,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt Deputy McLellan, but I wish to welcome Mr. Alan Savage to this meeting.

I acknowledge that a lot of good work has been done, in addition to a lot of good legislation being passed.  Last week, we dealt with the Child Care (Amendment) Bill, which is very welcome.  My only concern is that we need to provide resources to ensure that the after-care plans are implemented.  I also welcome the Children First Bill.  Senator van Turnhout got her amendment passed to remove the common law defence of \"reasonable chastisement\" in cases of corporal punishment, which is most welcome.<\/p> <p>  The adoption (tracing) Bill is progressing  but will it come before the Houses before the end of this D&aacute;il?  Other welcome matters include the additional &euro;17 million for children with disabilities, as well as extra budgetary funding for child care, particularly the second free pre-school year.  My only concern is over capacity, an issue that has already been raised by Deputy Troy.  There are concerns that sufficient places will not be available in certain areas around the country.  Can the Minister guarantee that every child will be able to avail of a place for both years?  Perhaps he cannot do so. <\/p> <p>  The question of social workers is of huge concern.  I acknowledge the additional funding for 400 extra staff but can the Minister tell us how many of those will be social workers?  I thank the Minister for his responses to questions I have tabled.  As regards the answer to Question No. 7, it prompted another question about the Youth Work Act 2001.  Does the Minister have any plans to review that legislation?  It is now 14 years old and our economic and social situations have changed significantly since then.<\/p> <p>  Question No. 8 concerned refugee children.  While the Minister's reply is reassuring, the question referred to all refugee children and not just those who are separated from their parents.  I know that in future we will be taking children in from war-torn areas.  All those children should be supported and funding should be made available regardless of whether they are separated from their parents.<\/p> <p>  I wanted to raise an issue with Tusla this morning but unfortunately I was not able to attend the meeting.  Perhaps the Minister could indulge me in regard to one or two minor concerns I have.  The first one is about reporting historical abuse cases and trying to get acknowledgements from Tusla with regard to receipt of queries, which we need.<\/p><p>There is a problem chasing it up.  It can take up to two months even to get an acknowledgement.  We are only reporting it - they are historical abuse cases - and we need to file that.  It is something we are not working on, rather we are just waiting for the reply.  It should be acknowledged as soon as it is received.<\/p><p> My office wrote to Tusla about an issue in September.  When we did not hear anything back, we followed up with a phone call.  It was actually my secretarial assistant who got on to a duty social worker.  She stated that they did not take representations from Deputies and that they were only treated the same as any concerned citizen.  She said an e-mail was not sufficient and that we would have to write to them.  My secretary printed off the e-mail and posted it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#U00400","speaker":"981","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":845,"content":"<p>That came from who?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#V00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":846,"content":"<p>Tusla.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#V00300","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":847,"content":"<p>That is what I thought.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#V00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":848,"content":"<p>It was a duty social worker who stated this when my secretary outlined the situation, which was just that we needed a referral to CAHMS for a child.  Due to behavioural issues, he was only receiving two hours of school per day.  It was a significant issue and he needed a referral.  While the truancy officer is working with the family, he has not to date - this happened in September - got a referral to CAHMS.  Following the posting of the letter, it still took nearly three months for Tusla to acknowledge it.  There has still been no referral or contact with the family.  It is something I wanted to highlight this morning to the Minister but did not have the opportunity to do so earlier.  It is difficult to get acknowledgements let alone to have anything processed or progressed.  During that conversation, the duty social worker said that a GP was the only person who could make a referral for the child.  It was pointed out that it states on the website that, in certain circumstances, a social worker can make it.  My secretary was told that the website was wrong.  I just wanted to make that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#V00500","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":849,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  It is very fitting that he has signed the commencement order on human rights day.  I know he did it purposely and it is really great.  Ireland, with its common law basis, has done something that has pointed the way for many countries.  The ripple effect will start.  The fact that the Minister has signed the commencement order so quickly is welcome and I thank him and his officials for their co-operation.  They made it happen.<\/p> <p>  I asked about the 24-hour out-of-hours service.  It is great to see at long, long last that it has started.  It is something we will all have to observe and monitor to see how access to services works.  However, I welcome it.  Deputy Troy asked about ICT.  I agree that there appears to be an impasse at Department level.  That is the understanding we got from Gordon Jeyes.  It is now between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health and that is where it stands.  I would welcome the Minister's views.  Where is it and is there something we should be doing as a committee?  Similarly in relation to psychological services, which the Child and Family Agency has the statutory remit to provide, I am extremely concerned that the necessary staffing is not in place which is supposed to have been provided by the HSE.  Again, it is an impasse.  While it is an impasse, the difficulty is that children are at risk.  I raise that with the Minister.<\/p> <p>  The issue of Oberstown was raised, and I thank the Minister for his response to the committee.  We could probably have a separate session on the issue of children in detention.  Of particular concern to the committee is the staffing level.  According to our colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who is paying attention to these aspects, there is a recruitment competition with a closing date for applications of today.  However, the advertisement did not say how many staff were being recruited.  It would be very useful for the committee to know.  I do not expect the Minister to have the figures now, but perhaps we could be advised of them.  We are still concerned about the following.  I checked the figures on Monday and there were 13 17 year olds in Wheatfield Prison.  We have not ended the detention of children in the prison system.  We should be conscious of that.  A separate issue I raised with the Minister for Justice and Equality and which also applies to the Minister is the need to get the daily occupancy and capacity figures within Oberstown.  The reason I can give the Minister the Wheatfield figures is that the prison publishes its statistics every day, including the number of 17 year olds.  If we could get them for Oberstown, it would be really useful.  We are extremely concerned at the recent report of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture published in November 2015.  The report raised concerns about the excessive use of force and handcuffs at Oberstown, the use of lock-up, insufficient access to natural light, the austerity of the rooms, staff numbers and ratios and the need to photograph and report.  As I said, that is a whole issue we could devote ourselves to as a committee.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister for all that he has done in the area of child care.  We have seen significant strides in development.  I have two specific questions on his announcements yesterday.  He announced funding of &euro;1.5 million for Learner Fund 4 to assist practitioners in early childhood care and education to upgrade their qualifications.  Reading the announcements, my understanding is that the fund will assist one person per setting to gain a QQI or FETAC level 6 qualification in early childhood care and education.  That is to help the settings to expand.  However, there is a major diversity in the size of early childhood care and education settings and services nationally.  I wonder, therefore, about limiting the funding to one staff member per setting, which may not give us the expansion the Department wants and the sector needs.  Can the Minister clarify whether as part of that incremental approach, it is his intention in time to expand the learner fund to support those who want to gain a level 7 or 8 qualification?  If settings are to expand and quality is to improve, level 7 qualified staff are needed to qualify for the higher capitation funding.  I am concerned that settings are at risk of losing their higher capitation funding, which is unacceptable.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Troy raised the special rapporteur report.  I have a question about the next report.  Would the Minister consider asking the special rapporteur to conduct a review of legislation and reports to date and to provide guidance in a comprehensive report for incoming legislators to give them an overview of the existing law and proposed laws and where we should be looking to further strengthen children's rights?  Another challenge for the future centres on legal fees.  This is the next major issue for the Department to address.  Is the Department going to publish a report so that we all understand the full scale of it?  We all hear about the legal fees, but where are the real blocks and where it is happening?  It the issue the reform of the GAL system?  Where do we need to focus our attention?  It is something I have not quite been able to identify.  I would welcome the start of work to build us up in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister for all he has done.  I give huge thanks personally for the constitutional amendment.  There are issues ranging from transgender children to smoking in cars with children for which I thank him.  I thank the Minister for furthering children's rights and welfare and I thank all the officials in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It is a new Department although we will probably not be allowed to say that about it from now on.  The Minister had to build up capacity and that has happened.  In each moment in time, I will have a long list of things that need to be done.  When one presses \"pause\" and looks at all that has been achieved in the past four and a half years, however, it is very significant.  Congratulations must go to each one of the Minister's staff in the Department acting under his leadership and that of Dr. Fergal Lynch.  I thank them all so much.  I wish the Minister all the best in his future endeavours and I wish all my colleagues well in getting re-elected because we need to continue this work and the impetus, urgency and ambition we have for children in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#V00600","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":850,"content":"<p>Thank you, Senator van Turnhout.

They will now be able to put their children into child care at an earlier age.  It has had a major impact on the ground and that is what I am hearing at the doors.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said over 400 new staff will be appointed at the Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  What will be the make-up of that staff?  I also welcome the launch of the national youth strategy.  It was an important that it was launched when it was because we are in a crisis with young people on the ground, particularly with addiction, young people involved with gangs and anti-social behaviour.  This leads on to building a better place for children in this country.<\/p> <p>  As we enter 2016 - it will soon be 100 years since the State was formed - if one looks back into the history of that time, there was poverty and neglect with children reared in slums.  We have come a far way since then.  I have read much about people&rsquo;s stories about 1916 and how they have lived, worked and reared their children since then.  Even though some of the stuff was bad regarding religious orders, we sometimes neglect to say there were many children who would never have had any education but for the effort put in by the religious orders.<\/p> <p>  When I was 18, I visited the Oberstown Centre when it was run by the Oblate Fathers at the time.  I have spoken to many people who work in the prison service dealing with youths.  When the new campus was opened at Oberstown, it was long awaited because of the condition of the old campus.  Are the staff there properly trained to deal with some of the young people who will come out of St. Patrick's Institution?  Not criminalising them all together, but they are different cohort coming from St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution into what used to be a detention centre for young people with problems.  I am concerned about the difficulties.<\/p> <p>  I also want to raise the amounts given by the special projects for youths, the youth facility services fund and the local drugs task forces to youth services in my constituency, Dublin 8, 10 and 12.  Significant sums of money have been transferred into these community groups.  Although I know most of the groups, some of them better than others, I have concerns about the duplication of some services.  When an application is made for an allocation of funding, who makes the decision which group gets the funding?  Who cuts the cloth and decides one group gets &euro;100,000 or another gets &euro;31,000?  In all my time as a council member and a D&aacute;il Member, I have never been asked by any Department or service what I thought of any of these groups, how they function or if they function.  I have never been asked as a public representative do these groups work, have I seen them working as someone who has been working on the ground with young people all of my life.  How is the decision made to give these allocations of funding to groups?  Is it made by a particular unit in the Department?  Do those involved visit the services?  Have they the history of these services?<\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister for his participation at these meetings because I find them rewarding.  I compliment his staff, as well as his predecessor, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.

I genuinely meant what I said earlier that I believe this committee has been very good at teasing out matters and improving our legislation for children.<\/p> <p>  The ICT support for the Health Service Executive, was raised by many members.  During the Estimates process, moneys were sought for this which we allocated.  The performance statement has been issued.  We have emphasised ICT and the national child care information system in that.  I made this clear at a meeting I had with the chairman and the chief executive officer of the executive.  They are also concerned about this.  It is not an issue of replacing one with the other but ensuring we have a joined-up service and there is not duplication.  These are important but expensive services to provide.  We need to have more cohesion.<\/p> <p>  We have the jigsaw programme, run by Headstrong, which uses speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and other professionals.  From the Department's point of view, we see the Tusla service focusing on the overall psychological welfare of children, including general and non-acute supports.  Acute services such as child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, should stay in the HSE, unless there is a big shake-up of the whole set-up.  Whatever service configuration we develop, we need to agree working relationships with the HSE to ensure no gaps or duplication occur.  Only in the past several days, I received a document on this.  It will have to be further considered and we will engage the HSE, Tusla and others.  Moneys have been put aside for this and in the interim we are purchasing private psychological services for children in care who are known to Tusla while we await an eventual agreement, so that children are not left disadvantaged.<\/p><p>In relation to the learner fund, I might ask my colleague, Ms Bernie McNally-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#W00500","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":855,"content":"<p>We will come back to that after we suspend for the vote in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#X00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":856,"content":"<p>Grand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#X00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":857,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Capital moneys that were given to Tusla in 2014 and 2015 remain unspent.  I met the chair and the CEO during 2015 to discuss this issue and the national child care information system, which I mentioned earlier.  I do not think money is the issue here<i>per se<\/i>.  Tusla wrote to the Department in late November about the HSE-Tusla service agreement.  The HSE indicated that Tusla received the same level of service as HSE staff.  It undertook to draft a service level agreement.  The issue is not whether the budget is 0.5% or 5%.  It is about service.  If Tusla is not happy with the service, we will have to look at it.  The Secretary General is meeting the chair and the CEO next Monday.  Obviously, ICT will be one of the main issues on the agenda at that meeting.  We all understand the importance of ICT,  When I talk about supporting social workers, for example, I refer to the level of ICT support they have, or do not have even though they should have it.  This is an issue for us.<\/p><p>I will come back to the main questions that were asked.  My colleague, Ms Bernie McNally, will speak about the mapping exercise because she has more up-to-date information on it than I have.<\/p><p>Deputy Troy is right when he says that the use of community employment scheme workers will cease in September 2016.  He asked what supports will be provided to the workers in question.  Ms McNally will address that in the context of the learner fund, for example.  Additional moneys have been put into the learner fund to help to support these workers.  The original timeline dictated that this would cease in September 2015, but we decided earlier this year, in light of the impact its cessation would have on community services, which depend on community employment workers, to give those services an extra year to get their people up to speed.  We will always have this dynamic.  Are we going to insist on quality in order to get the best outcomes for children, or are we going to continually accommodate those who do not come up to speed?  I think we have struck a fair balance by giving them an extra 12 months.  Many private providers are very cross about it because they have made the effort to invest in getting their staff up to speed, but they now see that others have not done so.  I want to put it on the record that I have no intention of allowing this to travel beyond September 2016.  I do not believe that would be the proper approach.  I know that might present challenges to people, but they have been given quite a bit of support to date.<\/p><p>The rapporteur's report is being circulated to the various Departments because it involves so many different people.  Senator van Turnhout raised this as well and she also asked for a report to be done on existing law.  We can examine this but it is probably a matter for the next Government.<\/p><p> A number of members asked about the figure for social workers.  A total of 400 additional staff will be recruited in 2016, 174 of which will be to social work posts.  This is a reply to Question No. 20 from the Chairman.  Tusla has been requested to provide a detailed plan showing how the recruitment targets are to be achieved.  As of September 2015, it was actively recruiting 344 staff, 258 of which relate to social work posts and 51 to other line services such as social care work, family support, psychology and counselling.  The agency has the money but I do not want the committee to get the wrong impression.  When I met the board members, I was complimentary to them.  They have done a great job.  They have set up a new agency and everybody is trying his or her best but having secured them the resources, the ball is very much in their court.  There is no question that is a challenge for them and they know it.  However, we will support them in every way we can.<\/p><p> The overall amount is &euro;36 million but of that, approximately &euro;16.5 million is for GALs.  The Department is working up a document on that and we have to engage in a manner that will allow us to change this but there will be a great deal of resistance to it.  The major problem we have is there is no control.  I do not mean to be critical of any individual but there is a sense overall of people lawyering up every time they go to court and that is costing the State a fortune.  That money should be spent on child care, not on legal fees.  We are all agreed on that and we are all seeking a resolution to that.  I am supportive of Mr. Gordon Jeyes and Tusla in resolving that.<\/p><p> Deputy Troy asked whether I had confidence in the management of Oberstown; I have.  A ballot will be taken but I am reassured by the fact that even when it announced the ballot, IMPACT said it would continue to work with management to resolve the issues.  The changes that are taking place present a challenge to staff but they are changes for the better and nobody in this room could think that it is a good idea to have three separate schools or three separate managements and three separate administrations and no crossover in support when somebody is ill or absent and cover is required.  That is not the way to move forward and there will be no yielding on that.  Other issues are being brought into play and it is not up to me to step into the middle of negotiations in an industrial relations dispute.  I have confidence in the management and I also have great confidence in the workers.  They will manage to resolve the issues with goodwill.<\/p><p> There is also the issue of shorter sentences in Oberstown.  It makes it difficult for staff to build up relationships with young people.  No one would suggest that sentences should be longer but these are all challenges that come as a consequence of change.<\/p><p> Senator van Turnhout raised the occupancy issue in Oberstown.  We can examine that.  The more transparent the position is, the better for everyone.  Some people see it is a threat but I believe it is a protection for those who work there.  I mean no disrespect to the Judiciary but there will be a need for a greater uniformity in terms of the use of Oberstown because no matter how much its capacity, it will always be limited.  Sentencing to detention should always be a last resort.  Members of the Judiciary - some of whom mean well in this respect - say, \"If there is nothing else for the child, what else can I do?\" but that should never be the case.  That is why we are investing in community services.  If we all work together, we can achieve a much better outcome for the child.  That is what we all want and I include the Judiciary in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#Y00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":862,"content":"<p>What about the issue of 17 year olds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#Z00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":863,"content":"<p>Is that about the number in Wheatfield Prison?  Somebody mentioned that 17 of that age cohort were in the prison but I was not aware that was the number.  The Chairman wanted to know when we will complete the new building.  Significant progress has been made.  The final unit will be received either this month or early next month but our main challenge is not the legislation or the building, which will be finished and handed over, but recruitment.  No member would question the quality of the build, which is good.  There will always be snags and so on and, as representatives of the taxpayer, we have to make sure we are not left with unfinished elements that incur further costs to the taxpayer.  We have had three rounds of recruitment and we have failed to secure the numbers we need.  We have, therefore, embarked on a fourth round.  We have had negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and we have been able to make an improved offering to those who may come to work there.  We have put the word out far and wide, both nationally and internationally, and I have brought it to the attention of the Minsters for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Social Protection.  The Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is in receipt of communication as well.  We are pulling out all the stops.  <\/p><p>This is exciting, challenging work and perhaps people are not aware that these well-paid jobs are on offer.  Members have asked how many we are trying to recruit and the number is 30.  All the applications will have been received by the middle of next week and we will screen out the ones that will not pass muster.  Then we will have an idea.  If we only get 20, we know we are in trouble.  If we get 40, 50 or 60, then it is game on.  Hopefully, we will have the staff in place quickly.  <\/p><p>Members mentioned training.  There will be continuous professional development and there are people <i>in situ<\/i>who are involved in that.  This is a priority for Government and we have done everything we can up to this point.  I am confident the building will be handed over.  Having had three rounds of recruitment and pulling out all the stops nationally and internationally, the issue we are faced with is whether we can recruit the right people.<\/p><p>Deputy Byrne mentioned the transfer of 17 year olds from St. Patrick's Institution.  None has been transferred because we do not want to inculcate that culture into the new detention school.  It will be a school of rehabilitation and re-education, not a secondary school for the university of Mountjoy.  We want as few people as possible to end up there but when they do, we want to make sure that as many of them as possible can be rehabilitated and do not end up in trouble later in life.  However, the reality of life is some will.  This is a huge step forward and I echo Senator van Turnhout's comments about the committee and the Government over the past four and a half years.  We have made significant strides in this area and we need to continue down that pathway, to which we are all committed<\/p><p>On CAMHS, Deputy Troy acknowledged this comes under the remit of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  We are concerned and we seek to meet regularly with the relevant officials to iron out issues.  I appreciate the Deputy's comments about the fund for special needs children in preschool.  It was always bizarre that there were SNAs in primary school but no supports of any consequence in the early years.  Services were sporadic throughout the country and involved local arrangements rather than anything national.<\/p><p>We want all children, including those with special needs, to reach their full potential because sometimes they can surprise people.  <\/p><p> Deputy Sandra McLellan talked about the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill that will be brought before the House.  The process has been very difficult and I thank the committee for its support, help and scrutiny of it, which has been really useful.  I will strive in so far as I can to address some of the major issues that have been a cause of concern for the Deputy and many people who are affected by the issue of adoption.  We are looking at it very closely and I hope to get something to the Attorney General reasonably soon.  I would like to receive permission to publish the Bill, but it will be a real challenge to get it done before Christmas.  The process has been hugely technical and difficult and I thank all those involved for their forbearance, not just members of the committee but all of the groups involved and all those affected.  I hope they will accept our bona fides in saying we are trying to get the best result as quickly as we can.  We do not want to rush it and end up making things worse.  <\/p><p> The Deputy asked about aftercare, the ECCE scheme and special needs and whether there would be capacity.  I believe there will be.  Ms McNally can address the issue further, but we are sensibly allowing time for the capacity to be built.  <\/p><p> I think Deputy Robert Troy may have been conflating, although not intentionally, the CCS capacity issue with that of the ECCE scheme.  They are separate.  I replied to a parliamentary question from the Deputy on whether the private sector would be prepared to take people on from the CCS scheme given that the charges were higher.  I do not think it will be a huge problem because it is a big opportunity for them.  While it is entirely up to them, I think many will be glad that we are taking the initiative to open these places to them where people are entitled but there is no community care scheme provider and, therefore, because of geography they have not been able to access it.<\/p><p> I have answered the question on Tusla and the number of social workers.  The figure is 400.  We will follow up on the issue of the duty social worker declining to provide information and of referring to the CAMHS and come back to the Deputy directly in writing.  We will make sure that will happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#Z00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":865,"content":"<p>I can provide the information.

The reason I have to leave now is I have a meeting with Mr. Bergin and others on Oberstown issues which I regard as very important.  As the Minister said, we have confidence in senior management, but it is very important that we engage with them fully to make sure they are working intensively with everybody.  This has been acknowledged and Mr. Bergin has been working extremely hard in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On the planned timing for taking all 17 years olds into the Oberstown centre, as the Minister said, we hope to do this as rapidly as possible.  Staffing is the issue.  There is one piece of information in which the committee may be interested.  We have been doing this on an incremental basis in the past few years.  The Oberstown centre has been taking 16 years olds since 2012 and in 2015 it began to take 17 year old remands.  We received some interesting data recently from it on how many young males would have been in adult prison if we had not moved to this system incrementally.  The total figure between 2012 and late-2015 is 428.  There are 428 cases of young males detained in the Oberstown centre between 2012 and 2015 who would have ended up in adult prison if the Minister had not incrementally increased the number of people and type of cases we can deal with in Oberstown.  The final component is 17 year olds on committal.  While we have not achieved this, all other children between 16 and nearly 18 years are now catered for and 428 cases have benefitted because of this.  I hope this information is of some use to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#AA01800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1449746100,"counter":880,"content":"<p>We have said a lot of negative things about the Oberstown centre, but there has been huge progression in the detention of children.

There are complex issues, but the anecdotal evidence from staff is that they feel vulnerable and do not feel safe, which will lead into the fear of potential applicants.  I encourage greater consultation with the staff to iron out the issues of training and staff rostering.

Senior management has been very conscious of the points he has made.  There have been a number of important HR developments that the Deputy may wish to note.

The point the Deputy about training is highly relevant in that regard.  There is now a designated human resources manager for the campus.  The post commenced in August.  There is a commitment to ensure best practice in the area of human resources.  To make sure we get the right number of staff in the right place, a good deal of work has been done for some time on the issue.  Much work has been done on recruitment fares, in changing rosters in the Oberstown centre and making it as attractive and practical as possible for people to work there.  Mr. Bergin and others have been promoting it as a good place in which to work.

She also mentioned St. Patrick's and Oberstown, which I have addressed, and the impact issue which I have also addressed.  With regard to money for youth services and various schemes, the Deputy asked how decisions are made and Ms McNally will go into detail on this.  They come through the county or city child care committees, depending on location, the voluntary child care organisations and the education and training boards.  They make decisions and recommendations to us.  A number of measures are in place to ensure money is used to optimal effect, and the Department is happy to receive feedback, so if the Deputy has specific concerns we can certainly speak to her.  The value for money report was very much on this issue, and the new youth strategy will allow us to implement its recommendations.<\/p><p>Value for money reports always cause concern because when people hear &quot;value for money&quot; they think there will be a cut.  Sometimes it does result in a cut in one service, but more money goes to another.  It is not a cut to take money from youth services, to which I pay particular tribute because they do a fantastic job.  For every euro we spend we get several euro back.  The value is beyond this, because we cannot put a value on the work they do.  It is outstanding and we can only stand back and admire the volunteerism in the sector, with 40,000 people giving of their time freely, many of whom went through youth services themselves.<\/p><p>We have quality standards in place, which puts a bit of strain on services, and they must show compliance with them.  This is another dynamic we face.  On the one hand we want quality, monitoring and to be able to validate, but on the other hand we do not want people who are giving freely of their time and volunteering having to spend hours writing reports and dealing with red tape.  We try to strike a balance and get it right.  Youth officers are employed by the education and training boards throughout country to monitor quality and report back.  The City of Dublin Education and Training Board youth officer is co-located with the Department.  The youth officers can make recommendations to my officials on reducing funding to one service and giving more to another.  This happened in Deputy Byrne's area, at St. Michael's in Inchicore.  I understand Deputy Byrne's concerns.  We know that in general we are getting great value for money and a great return for the Government's investment in supporting the youth sector, but there are always concerns about how to monitor and ensure we get the best for our children.  If the Deputy has specific concerns we will be happy to listen quietly to her and take it back through the chain and see where the problem lies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015121000002#BB00600","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449746100,"counter":889,"content":"<p>With regard to mapping to ensure we build enough capacity, the forward planning unit in the Department of Education and Skills has been very helpful to us and, this week we hope, it will give us data on the number of children born in each electoral division and therefore the number of children eligible to enter ECCE in September, January and April.  This will be detailed information which we will be able to pass on to the city and county child care committees in the coming weeks.  We have them on stand-by to receive the information.  They will then work with the providers to ensure they can build capacity.  They will know where there will not be any challenge and where there will be some challenges.  Where there are challenges, a number of measures will be taken.  We will restore capitation from September next year.  The Minister spoke about the learner fund and there will be a capital programme, which he is considering at present.  The Minister will be inclined to put this capital money into ECCE services to help with this capacity agenda.  While the interdepartmental group on disability is very much to the benefit of children, it will also help services which, in the past, absorbed some of this cost themselves.  It will help a little with their sustainability and encourage expansion.  We are doing a huge amount of consultation with the sector.  Yesterday, we met all the city and county child care committees and voluntary child care organisations, which we meet regularly to ensure there is good communication.  We speak to Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government about planning permission.  Yesterday, we put up new frequently asked questions on our website to help providers with this.  We are working very closely with them.<\/p> <p>  The question on community employment showed some concern for the individuals on these schemes.  We are working very closely with the Department of Social Protection, which runs the scheme.  It is very committed to continuing with the scheme and providing these people with training.

The eligibility criteria of community employment schemes mean the people on them are allowed to work a maximum of three years.  They must leave the service after three years and the only way community services can retain them is by employing them directly.  Most community services do not have the capacity to employ directly community employment scheme workers.  The group with which I work has five community employment workers, and not in a million years would it have the capacity to employ these workers when their eligibility runs out.  The new community employment participants coming to replace them will not have a level 6 or level 5 qualification.  This is the issue I want to highlight to the Department.

I do not have the total number, only the number of new workers.  Some 258 new social workers were recruited in 2014, with 174 to be recruited in 2015.  Those plus the replacements and ancillary staff amount to 532 people, recruiting all of whom will be a major challenge for Tusla.

I will take the opportunity to echo what several of them have said, that is, to thank my young Department - why would it not be young, looking after youth affairs and children - for all of its work.  Its personnel have met many challenges, but there are more to be faced.  We have worked well together with the agency, the youth sector and the voluntary bodies.  If we continue doing that, we can achieve much greater things for our children and make Ireland a better place in which to grow up.<\/p> <p>  I should also mention the previous Ministers.  The current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, did a great deal of work to set up the agency and the Department and get the children's referendum through.  The stay of the current Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, was short but none the less of high quality.  It is Christmas and the season of goodwill, but I genuinely thank the committee.
