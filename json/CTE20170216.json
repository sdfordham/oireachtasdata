I thank Deputy Cullinane.<\/p><p>Item No. 284C is a letter dated 1 February 2015, from a company called Flow East that was involved in a bid process run by NAMA for a property portfolio in the Czech Republic.  The letter raises concerns about the process conducted in the disposal of the Savarin portfolio.  The letter states that a full review into all NAMA projects should be conducted.  While the correspondence refers to information already received from NAMA, we should look for a note from NAMA on this case for the information of the committee.  We will seek a note from NAMA and then we can decide what to do next.<\/p><p>Item No. 285C is correspondence from an individual regarding the committee's role in the review of the wards of court fund.  The individual in question has been in regular contact with the committee about this matter.  We are still awaiting a departmental response.  Once we receive it, we can decide what action, if any, we can take at that stage.  We had a report, and we have recently asked the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to respond to the most recent comments.  We are waiting for the Department to come back to us.  It is an item that will not be dropped off our agenda.  If we do not receive a reply within the next seven days, we will ask for a reminder to be sent to the Department.<\/p><p>Item No. 286C is a copy of correspondence dated 20 January 2017 from an individual to the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, regarding the <i>guardian ad litem<\/i>service.  I suggest that we note this.  Somebody wrote to the Minister on the topic as this is all being discussed here, and provided us with a copy of that.  The original letter was for the Minister.<\/p><p>Item No. 287C, 1 to 3, is from an individual about the leasing of properties at Howth Harbour.  The previous committee looked at this and published a report which had been circulated to members.  As the correspondence required some clarification, the clerk contacted the individual in question.  The person has raised issues about the lack of transparency about leasing in Howth Harbour, the points or weighted system used to allocate leases and the lack of full feedback to unsuccessful applicants.  The person also raised concerns that there was not a suitable mix of building sizes being made available to cater for the different business needs.  The relevant Department is before the committee today and I suggest that we ask the Secretary General for a comment on this.  It comes under the domain of agriculture and fisheries because it is Howth Harbour, so it is within the remit of the Department here today.  We will specifically raise that and, if needs be, we can follow it up.  I understand that the previous committee went out and visited Howth Harbour, looked at the situation, did a report, and the gentleman said essentially that even though we did a report, nothing has changed.  We can raise it with the Department again today.<\/p><p>Item No. 288C is correspondence from Deputy Mattie McGrath regarding the overrun of costs in the building of the national children's hospital.  The national paediatric hospital development board is accountable to this committee, so I suggest that we schedule them as part of our work programme to get an update on the costs and construction.  It could be a while before we get them in.  We should specifically write to them to ask for an update about the cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#B02600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>This is very topical.

An audit is retrospective; it is an exercise in looking back.  We are very careful to ensure we do not try to become involved in making decisions.  If we are involved in the making of decisions, we cannot be independent when looking back at such matters.  The Chairman has referred to previous large capital programmes on which there were cost overruns.  The lessons from these cases need to be learned and rolled back into all other projects.  This is not the first time we have heard about or seen large escalations in costs in the case of a hospital or a large capital project and it is certainly something at which I will be looking, but that does not prevent the committee from asking the board to come in in the meantime to discuss its financial statements for 2015, for example.

I take Deputy Alan Kelly's point about making a decision at the start on the basis of one set of financial figures, before having to deal with changes in project costs as the project rolls on.

The Department was also the accredited paying agency for additional EU payments amounting to just under &euro;1.2 billion for 2015.  EU payments directly to farmers are accounted for separately from the Vote, but a summary is disclosed in note 6.1 of the account.<\/p> <p>  The Vote expenditure in 2015 was spread across four major expenditure programmes: &euro;387 million, or 31% of the total, was spent on agrifood policy, development and trade; &euro;196 million, or 15%, was spent on food safety, animal health and welfare, and plant health; &euro;355 million, or 28%, was spent on rural economy, environment and structural changes, and &euro;326 million, or 26%, was spent on direct payments to farmers.<\/p> <p>  The Department provides substantial funding each year for a number of public bodies that operate under its aegis.  These include Teagasc, An Bord Bia, the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.  The Department is also directly responsible for management of the six fishery harbour centres, for which separate accounts are also prepared.<\/p> <p>  A net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;104 million was approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in December 2015.  This was required to provide funding of &euro;68 million to finalise European Commission disallowances related to the period 2008 to 2014 and a further &euro;39 million due to an unanticipated delay in receipt of EU funding for rural development in 2015.  In addition, the supplementary process reallocated savings on certain subheads of the Vote to fund additional expenditure for fishery harbours, the areas of natural constraint scheme, the World Food Programme and a top-up to the EU market volatility payment.<\/p> <p>  At year end, net expenditure under the Vote was approximately &euro;69 million less than provided for, including in the Supplementary Estimate.  With the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, &euro;12 million in unspent allocations - mainly under the rural economy, environment and structural changes programme - was carried over for spending in 2016.  The remainder of the surplus for the year, totalling &euro;56.6 million, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 7 of the report on the accounts of the public services 2015 examines two substantial and unusual transactions between the Department and the EU in 2015.  The first transaction was the refund by Ireland to the EU of &euro;68 million for non-compliance with regulations governing the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.  In look-back reviews of a sample of land parcel-based payments funded by the EU made in the period 2009 to 2012, the European Commission identified concerns that could have resulted in substantial amounts being disallowed.  The Department contested the Commission's findings and conducted a further review of more than 900,000 land parcels on its system using newly acquired, higher resolution imagery.  It found that there had been an element of overclaiming in respect of 180,000 of the land parcels, or 19% of the total.<\/p> <p>  Arising from that finding, the Commission in May 2014 proposed a flat rate disallowance of 2% of funding in the period, equivalent to &euro;182 million.  The Department entered a conciliation process to negotiate the disallowance and, in July 2015, agreed with a Commission proposal for a disallowance of &euro;64.1 million for the period 2008 to 2012.  A lower rate of disallowance of &euro;3.6 million was agreed for 2013 and 2014, reflecting improved controls.  The Department also incurred costs of &euro;3.2 million during the review and negotiation stages, principally for new imagery and software, internal staff costs and external contractor costs.  The final agreed rate of disallowance for Ireland for the period 2008 to 2015 was equivalent to 0.8% of the funding provided.  This compares favourably with the average of 2.4% disallowance across all EU member states.<\/p> <p>  The second transaction examined in the report was the handling of milk producers' liability of &euro;71 million to the EU because they exceeded their milk quotas after they increased production in advance of the end of the quota regime on 31 March 2015.  Due to a fall in milk prices in 2015, the EU approved an optional scheme allowing member states to pay the liability and then recover it from milk producers over a maximum of three years.  Ireland was one of seven EU countries to introduce the scheme.<\/p> <p>  The Department required milk producers, before they could avail of the deferral scheme, to sign a legally binding agreement to repay their liability.  Approximately a quarter of the total liability was paid up front by milk producers who chose not to avail of the scheme.  The remaining liability is being recovered in instalments.

The Department is the paying agency for these EU payments, but take me through the process.

It would be difficult to attribute that to farmers except as a flat rate cut across everybody's payment.  By implication the problems the Commission says it found would not have been present on every farm so it would have been quite difficult in Irish law to sustain the idea that a flat rate cut be made across all farmer payments.

The imagery on the right of the screen derives, I think, from better use of satellite photographs, oddly enough, because satellites can adapt more quickly to lack of cloud cover, whereas with planes, one must arrange in advance that the plane will fly over on a particular day, and if there is cloud cover, that is it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#G01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":149,"content":"<p>After all that, I ask Mr. O'Driscoll to make his opening statement.

I am sorry but it covers much of the ground already covered by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Nevertheless, I ask the committee to bear with me.<\/p> <p>  The Department's gross allocation for 2015 was &euro;1,260 million, including a capital carry-over of &euro;18 million from 2014.  Towards the end of 2015, the Department sought a Supplementary Estimate, which provided funding to address the exclusion by the European Commission of &euro;67.6 million from EU funding of various agricultural schemes for the seven-year period 2008 to 2014, to which I will return again.  It transferred savings in certain areas of the Vote to fund expenditure under the fisheries harbour scheme, the areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme, the world food programme and a top-up to the EU market volatility payment, as well as providing an increase of &euro;39 million in the Department's permitted net expenditure to deal with a Commission decision, applying to all member states, to delay payment of some of their expected 2015 rural development receipts.<\/p> <p>  Gross expenditure in 2015 was &euro;1,264.6 million, and appropriations-in-aid were &euro;438.7 million, resulting in a net expenditure of &euro;826 million.  Gross expenditure savings amounted to &euro;60.5 million and &euro;12 million of the capital saving was carried over into 2016.  When the Supplementary Estimate was under consideration in late 2015, we were confident expenditure levels would be lower than the original provisions under some subheads, so some &euro;36 million was transferred as part of the supplementary to other areas of the Vote.  Our view at the time was that it would not be prudent to reduce allocations further, given the outstanding potential requirements, particularly in the agri-environment schemes, food safety and research.  In retrospect, given the eventual savings, it may be that less funding could have been requested by way of a supplementary allocation.  However, receiving the additional allocation did allow us to fully address a number of new pressing needs without compromising our existing schemes.<\/p> <p>  The Department is exceptional, as alluded to by the Chairman, in also being responsible for large EU payment schemes which do not appear on the Vote.  In 2015, these amounted to expenditure of &euro;1.2 billion.  The total expenditure by the Department, though the Vote and the fully funded EU schemes, therefore, amounted to more than &euro;2.4 billion.<\/p> <p>  During 2015, the agriculture and food sector continued to play a vital role in Ireland's economic recovery.  Food and drink exports reached &euro;10.8 billion, marking growth of more than 51% since 2009.  As this export figure does not include things like hides and skins and forestry, the total export figure from the sector was well north of &euro;11 billion.<\/p> <p>  The year 2015 was also marked by a number of major policy and operational developments, including the implementation of new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, schemes following the 2013 CAP reform, the adoption of the new co-funded &euro;4 billion rural development programme and the &euro;240 million seafood development programme, publication of the new overarching sector strategy Food Wise 2025, publication of a new forestry strategy and, crucially, the abolition of EU milk quotas.  The implementation of a large range of new schemes and measures was a major challenge for the Department but one to which our staff responded with great commitment and skill.  Among the new schemes implemented in 2015 were the new basic payment scheme, greening payment and young farmer top-up, which together accounted for the &euro;1.2 billion I have already mentioned; the green low-carbon agri-environment, GLAS, scheme, two tranches of which were opened to 38,000 beneficiaries in 2015; the new organic farming scheme; the beef genomics programme, which is a very innovative programme focusing on delivering accelerated genetic improvement in the national herd to deliver both environmental and economic sustainability; and the new targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS II, investment support vehicle, which includes the young farmer capital investment scheme, the dairy equipment scheme, the animal welfare, safety and nutrient storage scheme, the low emission slurry spreading scheme and the pig and poultry scheme.  Many schemes were opened in 2015.<\/p> <p>  As noted in Chapter 7 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, milk quotas in the EU were abolished on 31 March 2015.  Milk production in Ireland in 2015 was 6.6 million tonnes, an increase of 13.3% on the 2014 annual total.  The vast majority of this increase was in the post-quota timeframe, bearing in mind that it ended on 31 March.<\/p><p>While farmers continued to make substantial efforts over recent months to manage their supplies, the ending of the milk quota regime saw significant production over quota in the 2014-2015 year, the final year of the quota regime, resulting in a levy being incurred by Irish producers amounting to &euro;71 million.  Facilities for farmers to pay the bill in instalments and to help them to deal with the cashflow challenge were put in place by the Department following European Commission agreement.  It was pressure from Ireland and several other member states which led to the system being put in place.<\/p><p> The Department was required to pay the superlevy in full to the European Commission by the usual deadline of 31 November 2015 with the terms of the scheme requiring farmers to repay minimum one third payment each year between 2015 and 2017.  The Department paid almost &euro;71 million, of which &euro;35.6 million had been collected from producers with the remainder sourced from funds the Department had on deposit.  Just over 2,700 producers opted to pay levies of &euro;16.7 million to the Department upfront by 1 October 2015.  They elected not to use the provision to defer their payments.  The remaining 3,700 producers paid &euro;18.9 million to the Department by 1 October 2015 and agreements were signed with those farmers to repay the balance of &euro;35.6 million in 2016 and 2017.<\/p><p> A second issue in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report relates to a large EU expenditure disallowance in 2015.  In mid-November, the European Commission adopted a decision to exclude a total of &euro;278 million from 18 member states.  The net Irish disallowance amounted to &euro;67.6 million from EU funding of various agricultural schemes for the seven-year period, 2008 to 2014, inclusive.  This consisted of two elements, namely a &euro;64 million exclusion for the period 2008 to 2012 and a &euro;3.6 million exclusion for 2013 and 2014.  It represented 0.57% of the &euro;12 billion in EU funding for these schemes in this seven-year period.  The exclusions related mainly to Commission findings that some aspects of Irish control systems were insufficiently robust at excluding ineligible land from payments to farmers in EU funded schemes.<\/p><p> This decision was the outcome of a prolonged process which began with a proposed exclusion of &euro;181 million for the five years between 2008 and 2012 suggested by the Commission in May 2014.  The Department opposed the application of the proposed flat rate correction and sought a hearing with the EU Conciliation Body.  The Conciliation Body acknowledged the amount of work done by the Department in reviewing over 900,000 LPIS, land parcel identification system, parcels to identify and exclude ineligible areas to calculate the risk to the fund.<\/p><p> The report of the Conciliation Body in early 2015 concluded that the Commission and the Department should continue discussing the matter with a view to settlement.  The implication of this moved us away from the idea of a flat rate correction.  During the year, the Department undertook considerable additional work at the request of the Commission to give assurance to the calculated risk and was subject to a further verification audit by Commission officials.  The reduction of over 60% in the final correction clearly indicated the Commission's acceptance of the Irish approach.<\/p><p> From 2008 to 2016, the total EU disallowances incurred by Ireland amounted to 0.79% of agricultural expenditure.  This compared with an average of 2.74% for all member states.  These figures are an update on those in figure 7.4 in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#G02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I thank Mr O'Driscoll for his opening statement.

I completely agree with the importance the Deputy attached to it.  The UK accounts for approximately 40% of our agrifood exports.  Some sectors are much more exposed than that.  About 50% of our beef exports, for example, go to the UK.  This is particularly crucial because the UK beef market is the highest priced beef market in the world.  Accordingly, the importance of that to the beef sector is obvious.<\/p> <p>  Other subsectors, such as the mushroom industry, consumer foods and horticulture, are exposed sectors to the UK market in a number of different ways.  Their exports are heavily concentrated on the UK but they are also subject to import competition from the UK.<\/p> <p>  Within the dairy sector, the exposure is somewhat less.  Nevertheless, within some subsectors of that it is high.  For example, we produce a lot of cheddar cheese in this country, of which 60% goes to the UK.  This is a particular challenge because no one eats cheddar in such quantities.  We cannot just divert the cheddar off to France.  There are many challenges built into Brexit.<\/p> <p>  Have we done preparations for this?  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has pointed out on several occasions in public that the day he was appointed I handed him a large file of briefings, a large chunk of which were on Brexit.  It showed the research work we had done well in advance of the UK referendum.  We have been working hard on it since.  We were one of the first, if not the first, Department to set up a dedicated Brexit unit.  We have set up an elaborate process of consultation with stakeholders, which is our norm in major negotiations.  We have done this before in Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and trade negotiations.  I must acknowledge the first-class quality of input we have received from farming and agrifood industry organisations, the co-ops and so on.<\/p> <p>  As for the negotiations, we are engaging in an intensive round of discussions with the Commission, other member states and with the UK and Northern Ireland to make clear to them how important this issue is to Ireland and to put forward our demand.  Our demand is crystal clear.  We want to retain unfettered access to the UK market after whatever happens.  We also want to keep the UK market as a valuable market for the future.<\/p> <p>  We also have a major challenge on the fisheries front.  The Common Fisheries Policy is a complex construct.  In fisheries, one has this unique fact of a single common resource, the fish in the sea.  That resource has to be divided up and the Common Fisheries Policy is how we do this.  The UK accounts for a large proportion of EU fisheries waters.  UK waters account for one third of the catch of Irish fishing boats, for example.  The issues around fisheries are complex.<\/p> <p>  Are we doing any work on contingency planning?  A second strand of the work we are doing involves engaging with the agriculture sector, but also with the Commission and with our colleagues in the UK, especially in Northern Ireland, on the practicalities of managing any kind of border with exports and imports after Brexit.  I have told several sectoral groups that we have to negotiate strongly and clearly for the absolutely best outcome.  We also have to prepare for the worst outcome.<\/p><p>It would be foolish not to do both of those things.  That is a flavour of what we are doing.  I am happy to elaborate in more detail if the Deputy wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O'Driscoll's response.

The Department is subject to EU audits all of the time.  I do not wish to in any way minimise the importance of the disallowance because it is a very large disallowance and we are unhappy that we incurred it but this matter needs to be looked at in the context of the overall scale of the Department's payments and the size of disallowances in other member states.  The disallowances in other member states that are much larger than in our case are in member states that have excellent records.  They are not in member states in respect of which one might take the view that that is to be expected.  Why did it arise?  The primary reason is that when the Commission came here on various visits it identified issues on the ground.  When the Commission visits in the context of an audit it looks at a sample of files.  It looks particularly at a sample of cases in respect of which we have conducted inspections.  They also visit a selection of farms.  They then move randomly from the farms selected into neighbouring farms, for example, or other farms in the same areas.  The Commission makes its own judgment on whether land is eligible or not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I presume these are spot checks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#J00400","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487235600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Yes, and they are regular.  We have EU audits all of the time on all of our schemes.  As the Deputy said earlier, the EU is putting enormous sums of money into these schemes and so the level of audit is not surprising.  We do not have any difficulty with the fact that EU auditors investigate and trawl through the schemes in great detail.  We are visited by auditors from a number of different units in Brussels as well, as I mentioned earlier, by the certifying body, which is the private accounting firm in Ireland that works on behalf of the Commission.  We have all of those audits going on all of the time.<\/p> <p>  In this case, there was a series of audits from 2009 onwards.  These audits would usually have been brought to a conclusion much earlier than occurred but there were a number of things that happened.  We gave a robust response to each of the audits.  We raised issues where we thought the Commission had got it wrong.  The Commission engaged with us in this regard.  There is a good deal of respect in Brussels for Irish systems.  I do not believe they think we are engaged in anything nefarious.  There was a lot of engagement but also a delay due to a tragic death of a Commission official who was key to the investigation which knocked back the audit for another period.  It was 2013 before it came to fruition.  By then, we had undertaken a large review of 900,000 parcels.  A land parcel is, in most cases, a field or part of a field.  We undertook a very detailed assessment of all of the land parcels.  I know from talking to senior officials in Brussels that they were struck by this.  Other member states had generally taken the hit and tried to negotiate a lower flat rate correction and so people in Brussels were struck by the fact that we undertook such a detailed re-assessment of the land parcels.  In the process of that assessment, using the imagery which was shown earlier on screen, we found problems.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Aylward will be aware, Ireland is marked by a lot of marginal land.  The assessment of whether land is eligible or not is a tight assessment.  There are some instances of where land is clearly ineligible.  For example, if a house is built on a field that land is clearly no longer eligible.  In situations where rushes or scrub encroaches on a field there is an assessment to be done and a judgment to be made.  The orthophotography is very useful in, at least, pointing us in a direction to indicate where land might not be eligible.  We conduct 5% inspections.  We are required to do so by EU rules around land eligibility.  The final disallowance includes a number of different elements, some of which we could have collected from farmers because it was possible to pin a disallowance to an individual farm but the bulk of it could not have been collected.  Of the &euro;67 million, the amount that could have been identified to farm level would have been, maximum, &euro;20 million.  The nature of the disallowance was extrapolated in nature such that it could not have been pinned on an individual farm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I note that &euro;0.95 million was recouped from farmers.

This is where I hide behind the policy decision read out earlier.  I will go through the debt, which may be helpful.  The debt for the years 2013 and 2014 was very low.  There was only &euro;3.6 million of a disallowance for those years.  The reason it was so low is because, effectively, the Commission was happy with the systems we had in place by 2013, for example, the orthophotography and so on.<\/p> <p>  On the other debt, which is the &euro;64 million for 2008 to 2012, of that &euro;950,000 had already been paid to the Commission and so that amount fell away from the subsequent amount.  There were then a number of what are called \"specified risks\".  These amounted to &euro;21 million and were determined by the Commission.  This related to the kind of issue mentioned by the Deputy.  It may seem extraordinary but what weighed very heavily on the Commission was that in three individual cases more scrub was found adjacent to a hedge than we had allowed for.  Another issue rose in respect of an incorrect percentage reduction for scrub.  For example, there could be a field which has grass and animals but some of it is scrub.  The question that arises is whether to apply a percentage reduction of 20%, 40% or 50% to that field.  Another case involved a garden that was included in parcel.  I am told that the crucial issue was that there were some children's toys on the land and that resulted in it being identified as a garden.  Those specified risks which the Commission determined and then extrapolated across the country amounted to &euro;21 million.  It would have been difficult to pin those on individual farmers.<\/p> <p>  We collected another &euro;3 million from farmers in December 2014.  We did not send on that money to the Commission and so it does not appear in the figures we have given.  It will appear in the 2016 Vote because it brought to account in 2016.<\/p><p>One could include that as something also farmers have carried.<\/p><p> We then had another &euro;19.8 million, which was for 2008 and 2009.  There is a provision in EU legislation which provides that debts must be collected within four years from the date of the debt accruing and this was outside that period.  Although maybe, theoretically, one could have identified this at farm level, by the time this was all resolved it had gone beyond that time limit.<\/p><p> One then had a remainder of &euro;16.4 million, after the deduction of all of those figures.  No, I apologise, I forgot about another &euro;3 million, which is the carryover on commonages.  Commonages have been a regular feature of difficulty in EU audits.  Anybody who is familiar with commonage land will be aware it tends to be very high up in hills.  It is almost always marginal.  It has all the issues that I have just identified but it has the additional complication of multiple owners.  Commonage also came into it for &euro;3 million.  The final figure was &euro;16.4 million, which could have been then pinned on farmers.  What could have been pinned on farmers was the &euro;16.4 million, the &euro;1 million that we did and which was sent to the Commission, and the &euro;3 million which we did and which will be brought to account in 2016.<\/p><p> The one other thing I would say about the cost of this to farmers is what does not appear in those figures is that farmer payments in 2013, after all this was done, were &euro;12.5 million less than they would have been.  Of course, that is a permanent loss because that goes on.  As a result of the new determination of what land was eligible, farmers got &euro;12.5 million less than they would have got in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Can I ask, just because we will have to move on to other matters, how in the negotiations did the Department get the EU to come down on the figures?

Therefore, the case was fought through all the various stages that are identified in another graphic in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, each of which steps, if the Deputy likes, I could take him through.

Its representatives said, \"Well, all right then, but what about this?  What about that?\", and we went off and we looked at this and we looked at that.

As a politician and farmer, many people have made representations to me about trying to build for dairying, trying to get dairies right and milk machines etc. in starting up in the business.  I spent three or four frustrating months getting on to the Department to get the all-clear for the farmers to go and build to start milking in the spring, in January and February, like most do.  I am getting the same with GLAS.  Why is the system so slow?  With modern technology, why cannot the system be up and running, particularly when it comes to buildings?  All they need is to be allowed to go ahead and build and then, of course, the farmer has to go out physically and build it.  I wonder why are the payments from TAMS or GLAS under any of its headings so slow?  Can the Department quicken the process, in particular, when a farmer is waiting to get a building in place to start up dairying in the following spring?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#K02000","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487235600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>This is an area where there is a lot of commentary at present.  It is a fairly contested area.  I will make a couple of points.  Again, I do not want people to misinterpret this, but with these schemes we are way ahead of other member states.  One of our neighbouring countries or regions has only launched its agri-environment scheme this year.  We launched the new agri-environment scheme in 2015.<\/p> <p>  Second, of course, the great majority of people on GLAS have been paid - with 38,000 in the scheme and &euro;105 million paid to 30,000 so far - but our systems do indicate that there are issues in respect of the outstanding claims.  A total of 7,000 farmers have yet to be paid.  Technically, it is an advance payment but, anyway, 7,000 of them have yet to be paid.  In the last two weeks alone, &euro;8 million was paid to 2,250 farmers.  Therefore, we are whittling that figure down as rapidly as we can.  In quite a few cases, we need material back from the farmer.  To give an example I was given the other day, some farmers under GLAS are claiming a payment for low-emission slurry spreading, which is an important action in climate change emissions, air quality etc.  In that group that has not been paid, 300 of them have been identified who have not submitted the necessary evidence.  They have indicated they are claiming it but they have not submitted the necessary evidence.  They have been contacted and asked to send in the form.<\/p> <p>  There are other issues.  For example, again, to go back to these famous land parcels, if our system finds that there is something different between our record of land parcels and what the claimant has submitted, the matter has to be looked at.  It has to be eyeballed, as we say.  It might be when our staff look at the detail they think they find that it is okay, it is a small issue or they understand why the issue is arising.  It might be that they have to go back to the farmer.  What we are trying to do, and where I will put my hand up a bit, is better communications to the farmers as to what exactly the issue is, and we are trying to deal with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#K02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I was told that the Department's IT was not up and running.

There are some things a human being has to look at to see what is the issue.  The computer will say there is something amiss but a person must engage with it, look at it and examine it.  Some of the cases are quite complex.  In many cases the farmer may need to send us something or something has changed and the computer has identified that and we need to be satisfied that the change is okay.  It may be a slight change in the land parcel area or it might be, for example, that a partnership has been established since the GLAS plan was submitted, and that affects things, or they are flagged in the system.

The Department needs to change its attitude to CEDRA and the whole Department needs to realign itself, given the challenges we face as a country, not just with Brexit but in repositioning our country from the point of view of planning.  I encourage the Department to engage more in this and to try to work more closely with other Departments.  The lack of engagement, funding and overall will from the Department in this area has been astounding.<\/p> <p>  I want to say a few positive things about farm safety, which is a real issue.  I thank the Department for its initiatives in this regard and for the way in which it has co-operated in the programmes.  Unfortunately, expenditure is lower than expected and progress is not happening.  We are having more farm deaths than ever before and I ask the Department to redouble its efforts in this area.  I ask Mr. O'Driscoll to work with the line Minister to find more funding and look at other measures to help.  A chap from Galway was caught in a PTO shaft and lost his leg.  He goes around to schools, takes his prosthetic leg off and puts in on a table to shock the agriscience students in the class.  He is accompanied by a man whose own brother, someone I knew well, died.  We need to redouble our efforts on the schools programme because that is where we affect people.  Younger people have a bigger impact on older people and we need to start on the ground, which is inside schools.  As this chap cannot go around all the time explaining how he lost his leg, we need more funding for this.<\/p> <p>  My next point relates to the intergenerational nature of farming.  We need to get involved in mobile devices and apps.  Farming is seasonal and the safety mechanisms which work in autumn do not necessarily work in summer.  I encourage the Department to look at programmes to address this and I will write with some ideas.  Testimonials on public media, TV and radio are very important and the Department should redouble its efforts to put forward more funding in this area.  People across politics would support the Department in this regard.  It is unfortunate that expenditure is lower than anticipated.

I want to make one or two other points.  I notice in the Department's report, under land mobility measures such as the early retirement and installation aid payment schemes, that the Department paid out &euro;10 million in 2014 on the early retirement scheme.  This decreased to &euro;7 million in 2015.  Obviously, some of the people availing of the scheme are getting the State pension and, consequently, the payment from Mr. O'Driscoll's Department decreases if they clock into that.  I wish to link and relate this to a fact sheet Mr. O'Driscoll sent us on Irish agriculture for January 2017 which refers to farm structure data in Ireland.  The fact sheet refers to 139,000 farm holdings and an average farm size of 32.5 ha.  It details the proportion of family farms held by age and shows that 6% of farms are held by people under 35 years of age.<\/p><p>It states 53% are held by people over 55 years of age.  Therefore, 41% of farms are held by people in the 35 to 55 years age group.  Will Mr. O'Driscoll drill down into those figures and send us information relating to the total farmed land in the country for that age group?  I am seeking data not by the number of farms but by farmed land.<\/p><p> The figures could mask the situation.  While there may be a high percentage of farm owners who are elderly, this might not correspond to the amount of farmed land held by elderly people.  Many older farmers have land below the average farm size.  It would be useful for us.  The figures would be preferable to those for farm holdings, because they do not tell us how much of the farming land in the country is held by the various age cohorts.  I do not expect that Mr. O'Driscoll would have the figures here and now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#Q04300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487235600,"counter":403,"content":"<p>No, we would not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Does Mr. O'Driscoll have that type of information?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#R00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487235600,"counter":405,"content":"<p>It is possible that we would have to drill into our own systems to provide it.

Several countries have good age structures relating to the farming population.  However, by and large, they have got there through radical means.

We had a long session relating to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on Limerick previously.  The fact is the board is in a difficult financial situation.  We commissioned an Indecon report to examine various things, including governance, financial issues and issues of regulation.  We are trying to deal with those bit by bit.<\/p> <p>  One of the recommendations in the report was that Bord na gCon had to reduce its debt levels and improve its financial situation.  To achieve that, the recommendation was that the board would sell assets.  While the report was not prescriptive about what should be sold, Harold's Cross was one of the assets named.<\/p> <p>  Since 2014, we have known of a recommendation that the track at Harold's Cross would be sold.  Part of the reason is that the asset is likely to have significant value.  Second, it is only 4 km from another flagship stadium.  If we were starting from scratch, we would not plan things that way.  That is the position.<\/p> <p>  The board has been wrestling with this for some time.  It is obviously an emotive issue and has attracted strong feelings on various sides.  The decision on whether to run a track is a matter for the board.  The decision on the sale is a matter for the board.  However, the sale has to be consented to by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is the position.  At the moment the board has made a decision to close the track and sell it.  I do not know whether the local board was consulted.

However, one is also putting a tag on the other side and it is a waste.  It is not a waste, it is an identity tag, but I cannot understand why farmers such as me then have to go back in July and August and then - in my case for 20 cattle every year - put a third tag into them just for genomes.   I am actually tagging a calf that is idle for the year.<\/p><p>I have said this several times and it makes common sense.  One could have a big scheme, especially for the genomes and the genes.  There could be a proper scheme whereby, if a farmer had a spare tag, every female animal in the country could be tested at birth.  I cannot understand why they could not introduce such a scheme for a reasonable cost instead of a farmer having to bring in adult cattle and take 20 cattle samples every year which is another tag in an animal's ear when it could be done at birth, even for the animal's sake.

When that work is done we will hand the site over to the Department of Defence because the main occupant of the island is the Irish Naval Service.  The Government has approved a plan costing &euro;64 million for total works on the island.  We are currently working through that.

The committee is seeing some of the very early costs mainly around planning and engineering expertise costs, but there will be a peak in the work on Haulbowline, due to fall around 2017-18, and after that it will trail off to nothing as we complete the work, and happily hand the whole thing over to the Department of Defence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#U01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":547,"content":"<p>Is the site owned by the State?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#U01300","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487235600,"counter":548,"content":"<p>Yes and it is a very significant island.

Money goes to Bord na gCon, the Marine Institute and Horse Racing Ireland and then the Department is in here facing questions.  I would love to see a proactive approach.  Consider the HSE, for example, which was before the committee and justifying and auditing retrospectively.  The Department is funnelling public money and then it is being asked how many times a year it is meeting - once a year in Mr. Gleeson's case or four times a year.
