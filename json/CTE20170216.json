I thank Deputy Cullinane.<\/p><p>Item No. 284C is a letter dated 1 February 2015, from a company called Flow East that was involved in a bid process run by NAMA for a property portfolio in the Czech Republic.  The letter raises concerns about the process conducted in the disposal of the Savarin portfolio.  The letter states that a full review into all NAMA projects should be conducted.  While the correspondence refers to information already received from NAMA, we should look for a note from NAMA on this case for the information of the committee.  We will seek a note from NAMA and then we can decide what to do next.<\/p><p>Item No. 285C is correspondence from an individual regarding the committee's role in the review of the wards of court fund.  The individual in question has been in regular contact with the committee about this matter.  We are still awaiting a departmental response.  Once we receive it, we can decide what action, if any, we can take at that stage.  We had a report, and we have recently asked the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to respond to the most recent comments.  We are waiting for the Department to come back to us.  It is an item that will not be dropped off our agenda.  If we do not receive a reply within the next seven days, we will ask for a reminder to be sent to the Department.<\/p><p>Item No. 286C is a copy of correspondence dated 20 January 2017 from an individual to the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, regarding the <i>guardian ad litem<\/i>service.  I suggest that we note this.  Somebody wrote to the Minister on the topic as this is all being discussed here, and provided us with a copy of that.  The original letter was for the Minister.<\/p><p>Item No. 287C, 1 to 3, is from an individual about the leasing of properties at Howth Harbour.  The previous committee looked at this and published a report which had been circulated to members.  As the correspondence required some clarification, the clerk contacted the individual in question.  The person has raised issues about the lack of transparency about leasing in Howth Harbour, the points or weighted system used to allocate leases and the lack of full feedback to unsuccessful applicants.  The person also raised concerns that there was not a suitable mix of building sizes being made available to cater for the different business needs.  The relevant Department is before the committee today and I suggest that we ask the Secretary General for a comment on this.  It comes under the domain of agriculture and fisheries because it is Howth Harbour, so it is within the remit of the Department here today.  We will specifically raise that and, if needs be, we can follow it up.  I understand that the previous committee went out and visited Howth Harbour, looked at the situation, did a report, and the gentleman said essentially that even though we did a report, nothing has changed.  We can raise it with the Department again today.<\/p><p>Item No. 288C is correspondence from Deputy Mattie McGrath regarding the overrun of costs in the building of the national children's hospital.  The national paediatric hospital development board is accountable to this committee, so I suggest that we schedule them as part of our work programme to get an update on the costs and construction.  It could be a while before we get them in.  We should specifically write to them to ask for an update about the cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#B02600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>This is very topical.

An audit is retrospective; it is an exercise in looking back.  We are very careful to ensure we do not try to become involved in making decisions.  If we are involved in the making of decisions, we cannot be independent when looking back at such matters.  The Chairman has referred to previous large capital programmes on which there were cost overruns.  The lessons from these cases need to be learned and rolled back into all other projects.  This is not the first time we have heard about or seen large escalations in costs in the case of a hospital or a large capital project and it is certainly something at which I will be looking, but that does not prevent the committee from asking the board to come in in the meantime to discuss its financial statements for 2015, for example.

I take Deputy Alan Kelly's point about making a decision at the start on the basis of one set of financial figures, before having to deal with changes in project costs as the project rolls on.

The Department was also the accredited paying agency for additional EU payments amounting to just under &euro;1.2 billion for 2015.  EU payments directly to farmers are accounted for separately from the Vote, but a summary is disclosed in note 6.1 of the account.<\/p> <p>  The Vote expenditure in 2015 was spread across four major expenditure programmes: &euro;387 million, or 31% of the total, was spent on agrifood policy, development and trade; &euro;196 million, or 15%, was spent on food safety, animal health and welfare, and plant health; &euro;355 million, or 28%, was spent on rural economy, environment and structural changes, and &euro;326 million, or 26%, was spent on direct payments to farmers.<\/p> <p>  The Department provides substantial funding each year for a number of public bodies that operate under its aegis.  These include Teagasc, An Bord Bia, the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.  The Department is also directly responsible for management of the six fishery harbour centres, for which separate accounts are also prepared.<\/p> <p>  A net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;104 million was approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in December 2015.  This was required to provide funding of &euro;68 million to finalise European Commission disallowances related to the period 2008 to 2014 and a further &euro;39 million due to an unanticipated delay in receipt of EU funding for rural development in 2015.  In addition, the supplementary process reallocated savings on certain subheads of the Vote to fund additional expenditure for fishery harbours, the areas of natural constraint scheme, the World Food Programme and a top-up to the EU market volatility payment.<\/p> <p>  At year end, net expenditure under the Vote was approximately &euro;69 million less than provided for, including in the Supplementary Estimate.  With the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, &euro;12 million in unspent allocations - mainly under the rural economy, environment and structural changes programme - was carried over for spending in 2016.  The remainder of the surplus for the year, totalling &euro;56.6 million, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 7 of the report on the accounts of the public services 2015 examines two substantial and unusual transactions between the Department and the EU in 2015.  The first transaction was the refund by Ireland to the EU of &euro;68 million for non-compliance with regulations governing the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.  In look-back reviews of a sample of land parcel-based payments funded by the EU made in the period 2009 to 2012, the European Commission identified concerns that could have resulted in substantial amounts being disallowed.  The Department contested the Commission's findings and conducted a further review of more than 900,000 land parcels on its system using newly acquired, higher resolution imagery.  It found that there had been an element of overclaiming in respect of 180,000 of the land parcels, or 19% of the total.<\/p> <p>  Arising from that finding, the Commission in May 2014 proposed a flat rate disallowance of 2% of funding in the period, equivalent to &euro;182 million.  The Department entered a conciliation process to negotiate the disallowance and, in July 2015, agreed with a Commission proposal for a disallowance of &euro;64.1 million for the period 2008 to 2012.  A lower rate of disallowance of &euro;3.6 million was agreed for 2013 and 2014, reflecting improved controls.  The Department also incurred costs of &euro;3.2 million during the review and negotiation stages, principally for new imagery and software, internal staff costs and external contractor costs.  The final agreed rate of disallowance for Ireland for the period 2008 to 2015 was equivalent to 0.8% of the funding provided.  This compares favourably with the average of 2.4% disallowance across all EU member states.<\/p> <p>  The second transaction examined in the report was the handling of milk producers' liability of &euro;71 million to the EU because they exceeded their milk quotas after they increased production in advance of the end of the quota regime on 31 March 2015.  Due to a fall in milk prices in 2015, the EU approved an optional scheme allowing member states to pay the liability and then recover it from milk producers over a maximum of three years.  Ireland was one of seven EU countries to introduce the scheme.<\/p> <p>  The Department required milk producers, before they could avail of the deferral scheme, to sign a legally binding agreement to repay their liability.  Approximately a quarter of the total liability was paid up front by milk producers who chose not to avail of the scheme.  The remaining liability is being recovered in instalments.

The Department is the paying agency for these EU payments, but take me through the process.

It would be difficult to attribute that to farmers except as a flat rate cut across everybody's payment.  By implication the problems the Commission says it found would not have been present on every farm so it would have been quite difficult in Irish law to sustain the idea that a flat rate cut be made across all farmer payments.

The imagery on the right of the screen derives, I think, from better use of satellite photographs, oddly enough, because satellites can adapt more quickly to lack of cloud cover, whereas with planes, one must arrange in advance that the plane will fly over on a particular day, and if there is cloud cover, that is it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#G01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":149,"content":"<p>After all that, I ask Mr. O'Driscoll to make his opening statement.

I am sorry but it covers much of the ground already covered by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Nevertheless, I ask the committee to bear with me.<\/p> <p>  The Department's gross allocation for 2015 was &euro;1,260 million, including a capital carry-over of &euro;18 million from 2014.  Towards the end of 2015, the Department sought a Supplementary Estimate, which provided funding to address the exclusion by the European Commission of &euro;67.6 million from EU funding of various agricultural schemes for the seven-year period 2008 to 2014, to which I will return again.  It transferred savings in certain areas of the Vote to fund expenditure under the fisheries harbour scheme, the areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme, the world food programme and a top-up to the EU market volatility payment, as well as providing an increase of &euro;39 million in the Department's permitted net expenditure to deal with a Commission decision, applying to all member states, to delay payment of some of their expected 2015 rural development receipts.<\/p> <p>  Gross expenditure in 2015 was &euro;1,264.6 million, and appropriations-in-aid were &euro;438.7 million, resulting in a net expenditure of &euro;826 million.  Gross expenditure savings amounted to &euro;60.5 million and &euro;12 million of the capital saving was carried over into 2016.  When the Supplementary Estimate was under consideration in late 2015, we were confident expenditure levels would be lower than the original provisions under some subheads, so some &euro;36 million was transferred as part of the supplementary to other areas of the Vote.  Our view at the time was that it would not be prudent to reduce allocations further, given the outstanding potential requirements, particularly in the agri-environment schemes, food safety and research.  In retrospect, given the eventual savings, it may be that less funding could have been requested by way of a supplementary allocation.  However, receiving the additional allocation did allow us to fully address a number of new pressing needs without compromising our existing schemes.<\/p> <p>  The Department is exceptional, as alluded to by the Chairman, in also being responsible for large EU payment schemes which do not appear on the Vote.  In 2015, these amounted to expenditure of &euro;1.2 billion.  The total expenditure by the Department, though the Vote and the fully funded EU schemes, therefore, amounted to more than &euro;2.4 billion.<\/p> <p>  During 2015, the agriculture and food sector continued to play a vital role in Ireland's economic recovery.  Food and drink exports reached &euro;10.8 billion, marking growth of more than 51% since 2009.  As this export figure does not include things like hides and skins and forestry, the total export figure from the sector was well north of &euro;11 billion.<\/p> <p>  The year 2015 was also marked by a number of major policy and operational developments, including the implementation of new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, schemes following the 2013 CAP reform, the adoption of the new co-funded &euro;4 billion rural development programme and the &euro;240 million seafood development programme, publication of the new overarching sector strategy Food Wise 2025, publication of a new forestry strategy and, crucially, the abolition of EU milk quotas.  The implementation of a large range of new schemes and measures was a major challenge for the Department but one to which our staff responded with great commitment and skill.  Among the new schemes implemented in 2015 were the new basic payment scheme, greening payment and young farmer top-up, which together accounted for the &euro;1.2 billion I have already mentioned; the green low-carbon agri-environment, GLAS, scheme, two tranches of which were opened to 38,000 beneficiaries in 2015; the new organic farming scheme; the beef genomics programme, which is a very innovative programme focusing on delivering accelerated genetic improvement in the national herd to deliver both environmental and economic sustainability; and the new targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS II, investment support vehicle, which includes the young farmer capital investment scheme, the dairy equipment scheme, the animal welfare, safety and nutrient storage scheme, the low emission slurry spreading scheme and the pig and poultry scheme.  Many schemes were opened in 2015.<\/p> <p>  As noted in Chapter 7 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, milk quotas in the EU were abolished on 31 March 2015.  Milk production in Ireland in 2015 was 6.6 million tonnes, an increase of 13.3% on the 2014 annual total.  The vast majority of this increase was in the post-quota timeframe, bearing in mind that it ended on 31 March.<\/p><p>While farmers continued to make substantial efforts over recent months to manage their supplies, the ending of the milk quota regime saw significant production over quota in the 2014-2015 year, the final year of the quota regime, resulting in a levy being incurred by Irish producers amounting to &euro;71 million.  Facilities for farmers to pay the bill in instalments and to help them to deal with the cashflow challenge were put in place by the Department following European Commission agreement.  It was pressure from Ireland and several other member states which led to the system being put in place.<\/p><p> The Department was required to pay the superlevy in full to the European Commission by the usual deadline of 31 November 2015 with the terms of the scheme requiring farmers to repay minimum one third payment each year between 2015 and 2017.  The Department paid almost &euro;71 million, of which &euro;35.6 million had been collected from producers with the remainder sourced from funds the Department had on deposit.  Just over 2,700 producers opted to pay levies of &euro;16.7 million to the Department upfront by 1 October 2015.  They elected not to use the provision to defer their payments.  The remaining 3,700 producers paid &euro;18.9 million to the Department by 1 October 2015 and agreements were signed with those farmers to repay the balance of &euro;35.6 million in 2016 and 2017.<\/p><p> A second issue in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report relates to a large EU expenditure disallowance in 2015.  In mid-November, the European Commission adopted a decision to exclude a total of &euro;278 million from 18 member states.  The net Irish disallowance amounted to &euro;67.6 million from EU funding of various agricultural schemes for the seven-year period, 2008 to 2014, inclusive.  This consisted of two elements, namely a &euro;64 million exclusion for the period 2008 to 2012 and a &euro;3.6 million exclusion for 2013 and 2014.  It represented 0.57% of the &euro;12 billion in EU funding for these schemes in this seven-year period.  The exclusions related mainly to Commission findings that some aspects of Irish control systems were insufficiently robust at excluding ineligible land from payments to farmers in EU funded schemes.<\/p><p> This decision was the outcome of a prolonged process which began with a proposed exclusion of &euro;181 million for the five years between 2008 and 2012 suggested by the Commission in May 2014.  The Department opposed the application of the proposed flat rate correction and sought a hearing with the EU Conciliation Body.  The Conciliation Body acknowledged the amount of work done by the Department in reviewing over 900,000 LPIS, land parcel identification system, parcels to identify and exclude ineligible areas to calculate the risk to the fund.<\/p><p> The report of the Conciliation Body in early 2015 concluded that the Commission and the Department should continue discussing the matter with a view to settlement.  The implication of this moved us away from the idea of a flat rate correction.  During the year, the Department undertook considerable additional work at the request of the Commission to give assurance to the calculated risk and was subject to a further verification audit by Commission officials.  The reduction of over 60% in the final correction clearly indicated the Commission's acceptance of the Irish approach.<\/p><p> From 2008 to 2016, the total EU disallowances incurred by Ireland amounted to 0.79% of agricultural expenditure.  This compared with an average of 2.74% for all member states.  These figures are an update on those in figure 7.4 in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#G02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I thank Mr O'Driscoll for his opening statement.

I completely agree with the importance the Deputy attached to it.  The UK accounts for approximately 40% of our agrifood exports.  Some sectors are much more exposed than that.  About 50% of our beef exports, for example, go to the UK.  This is particularly crucial because the UK beef market is the highest priced beef market in the world.  Accordingly, the importance of that to the beef sector is obvious.<\/p> <p>  Other subsectors, such as the mushroom industry, consumer foods and horticulture, are exposed sectors to the UK market in a number of different ways.  Their exports are heavily concentrated on the UK but they are also subject to import competition from the UK.<\/p> <p>  Within the dairy sector, the exposure is somewhat less.  Nevertheless, within some subsectors of that it is high.  For example, we produce a lot of cheddar cheese in this country, of which 60% goes to the UK.  This is a particular challenge because no one eats cheddar in such quantities.  We cannot just divert the cheddar off to France.  There are many challenges built into Brexit.<\/p> <p>  Have we done preparations for this?  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has pointed out on several occasions in public that the day he was appointed I handed him a large file of briefings, a large chunk of which were on Brexit.  It showed the research work we had done well in advance of the UK referendum.  We have been working hard on it since.  We were one of the first, if not the first, Department to set up a dedicated Brexit unit.  We have set up an elaborate process of consultation with stakeholders, which is our norm in major negotiations.  We have done this before in Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and trade negotiations.  I must acknowledge the first-class quality of input we have received from farming and agrifood industry organisations, the co-ops and so on.<\/p> <p>  As for the negotiations, we are engaging in an intensive round of discussions with the Commission, other member states and with the UK and Northern Ireland to make clear to them how important this issue is to Ireland and to put forward our demand.  Our demand is crystal clear.  We want to retain unfettered access to the UK market after whatever happens.  We also want to keep the UK market as a valuable market for the future.<\/p> <p>  We also have a major challenge on the fisheries front.  The Common Fisheries Policy is a complex construct.  In fisheries, one has this unique fact of a single common resource, the fish in the sea.  That resource has to be divided up and the Common Fisheries Policy is how we do this.  The UK accounts for a large proportion of EU fisheries waters.  UK waters account for one third of the catch of Irish fishing boats, for example.  The issues around fisheries are complex.<\/p> <p>  Are we doing any work on contingency planning?  A second strand of the work we are doing involves engaging with the agriculture sector, but also with the Commission and with our colleagues in the UK, especially in Northern Ireland, on the practicalities of managing any kind of border with exports and imports after Brexit.  I have told several sectoral groups that we have to negotiate strongly and clearly for the absolutely best outcome.  We also have to prepare for the worst outcome.<\/p><p>It would be foolish not to do both of those things.  That is a flavour of what we are doing.  I am happy to elaborate in more detail if the Deputy wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O'Driscoll's response.

The Department is subject to EU audits all of the time.  I do not wish to in any way minimise the importance of the disallowance because it is a very large disallowance and we are unhappy that we incurred it but this matter needs to be looked at in the context of the overall scale of the Department's payments and the size of disallowances in other member states.  The disallowances in other member states that are much larger than in our case are in member states that have excellent records.  They are not in member states in respect of which one might take the view that that is to be expected.  Why did it arise?  The primary reason is that when the Commission came here on various visits it identified issues on the ground.  When the Commission visits in the context of an audit it looks at a sample of files.  It looks particularly at a sample of cases in respect of which we have conducted inspections.  They also visit a selection of farms.  They then move randomly from the farms selected into neighbouring farms, for example, or other farms in the same areas.  The Commission makes its own judgment on whether land is eligible or not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I presume these are spot checks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#J00400","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487235600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Yes, and they are regular.  We have EU audits all of the time on all of our schemes.  As the Deputy said earlier, the EU is putting enormous sums of money into these schemes and so the level of audit is not surprising.  We do not have any difficulty with the fact that EU auditors investigate and trawl through the schemes in great detail.  We are visited by auditors from a number of different units in Brussels as well, as I mentioned earlier, by the certifying body, which is the private accounting firm in Ireland that works on behalf of the Commission.  We have all of those audits going on all of the time.<\/p> <p>  In this case, there was a series of audits from 2009 onwards.  These audits would usually have been brought to a conclusion much earlier than occurred but there were a number of things that happened.  We gave a robust response to each of the audits.  We raised issues where we thought the Commission had got it wrong.  The Commission engaged with us in this regard.  There is a good deal of respect in Brussels for Irish systems.  I do not believe they think we are engaged in anything nefarious.  There was a lot of engagement but also a delay due to a tragic death of a Commission official who was key to the investigation which knocked back the audit for another period.  It was 2013 before it came to fruition.  By then, we had undertaken a large review of 900,000 parcels.  A land parcel is, in most cases, a field or part of a field.  We undertook a very detailed assessment of all of the land parcels.  I know from talking to senior officials in Brussels that they were struck by this.  Other member states had generally taken the hit and tried to negotiate a lower flat rate correction and so people in Brussels were struck by the fact that we undertook such a detailed re-assessment of the land parcels.  In the process of that assessment, using the imagery which was shown earlier on screen, we found problems.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Aylward will be aware, Ireland is marked by a lot of marginal land.  The assessment of whether land is eligible or not is a tight assessment.  There are some instances of where land is clearly ineligible.  For example, if a house is built on a field that land is clearly no longer eligible.  In situations where rushes or scrub encroaches on a field there is an assessment to be done and a judgment to be made.  The orthophotography is very useful in, at least, pointing us in a direction to indicate where land might not be eligible.  We conduct 5% inspections.  We are required to do so by EU rules around land eligibility.  The final disallowance includes a number of different elements, some of which we could have collected from farmers because it was possible to pin a disallowance to an individual farm but the bulk of it could not have been collected.  Of the &euro;67 million, the amount that could have been identified to farm level would have been, maximum, &euro;20 million.  The nature of the disallowance was extrapolated in nature such that it could not have been pinned on an individual farm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I note that &euro;0.95 million was recouped from farmers.

This is where I hide behind the policy decision read out earlier.  I will go through the debt, which may be helpful.  The debt for the years 2013 and 2014 was very low.  There was only &euro;3.6 million of a disallowance for those years.  The reason it was so low is because, effectively, the Commission was happy with the systems we had in place by 2013, for example, the orthophotography and so on.<\/p> <p>  On the other debt, which is the &euro;64 million for 2008 to 2012, of that &euro;950,000 had already been paid to the Commission and so that amount fell away from the subsequent amount.  There were then a number of what are called \"specified risks\".  These amounted to &euro;21 million and were determined by the Commission.  This related to the kind of issue mentioned by the Deputy.  It may seem extraordinary but what weighed very heavily on the Commission was that in three individual cases more scrub was found adjacent to a hedge than we had allowed for.  Another issue rose in respect of an incorrect percentage reduction for scrub.  For example, there could be a field which has grass and animals but some of it is scrub.  The question that arises is whether to apply a percentage reduction of 20%, 40% or 50% to that field.  Another case involved a garden that was included in parcel.  I am told that the crucial issue was that there were some children's toys on the land and that resulted in it being identified as a garden.  Those specified risks which the Commission determined and then extrapolated across the country amounted to &euro;21 million.  It would have been difficult to pin those on individual farmers.<\/p> <p>  We collected another &euro;3 million from farmers in December 2014.  We did not send on that money to the Commission and so it does not appear in the figures we have given.  It will appear in the 2016 Vote because it brought to account in 2016.<\/p><p>One could include that as something also farmers have carried.<\/p><p> We then had another &euro;19.8 million, which was for 2008 and 2009.  There is a provision in EU legislation which provides that debts must be collected within four years from the date of the debt accruing and this was outside that period.  Although maybe, theoretically, one could have identified this at farm level, by the time this was all resolved it had gone beyond that time limit.<\/p><p> One then had a remainder of &euro;16.4 million, after the deduction of all of those figures.  No, I apologise, I forgot about another &euro;3 million, which is the carryover on commonages.  Commonages have been a regular feature of difficulty in EU audits.  Anybody who is familiar with commonage land will be aware it tends to be very high up in hills.  It is almost always marginal.  It has all the issues that I have just identified but it has the additional complication of multiple owners.  Commonage also came into it for &euro;3 million.  The final figure was &euro;16.4 million, which could have been then pinned on farmers.  What could have been pinned on farmers was the &euro;16.4 million, the &euro;1 million that we did and which was sent to the Commission, and the &euro;3 million which we did and which will be brought to account in 2016.<\/p><p> The one other thing I would say about the cost of this to farmers is what does not appear in those figures is that farmer payments in 2013, after all this was done, were &euro;12.5 million less than they would have been.  Of course, that is a permanent loss because that goes on.  As a result of the new determination of what land was eligible, farmers got &euro;12.5 million less than they would have got in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Can I ask, just because we will have to move on to other matters, how in the negotiations did the Department get the EU to come down on the figures?

Therefore, the case was fought through all the various stages that are identified in another graphic in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, each of which steps, if the Deputy likes, I could take him through.

Its representatives said, \"Well, all right then, but what about this?  What about that?\", and we went off and we looked at this and we looked at that.

As a politician and farmer, many people have made representations to me about trying to build for dairying, trying to get dairies right and milk machines etc. in starting up in the business.  I spent three or four frustrating months getting on to the Department to get the all-clear for the farmers to go and build to start milking in the spring, in January and February, like most do.  I am getting the same with GLAS.  Why is the system so slow?  With modern technology, why cannot the system be up and running, particularly when it comes to buildings?  All they need is to be allowed to go ahead and build and then, of course, the farmer has to go out physically and build it.  I wonder why are the payments from TAMS or GLAS under any of its headings so slow?  Can the Department quicken the process, in particular, when a farmer is waiting to get a building in place to start up dairying in the following spring?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#K02000","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487235600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>This is an area where there is a lot of commentary at present.  It is a fairly contested area.  I will make a couple of points.  Again, I do not want people to misinterpret this, but with these schemes we are way ahead of other member states.  One of our neighbouring countries or regions has only launched its agri-environment scheme this year.  We launched the new agri-environment scheme in 2015.<\/p> <p>  Second, of course, the great majority of people on GLAS have been paid - with 38,000 in the scheme and &euro;105 million paid to 30,000 so far - but our systems do indicate that there are issues in respect of the outstanding claims.  A total of 7,000 farmers have yet to be paid.  Technically, it is an advance payment but, anyway, 7,000 of them have yet to be paid.  In the last two weeks alone, &euro;8 million was paid to 2,250 farmers.  Therefore, we are whittling that figure down as rapidly as we can.  In quite a few cases, we need material back from the farmer.  To give an example I was given the other day, some farmers under GLAS are claiming a payment for low-emission slurry spreading, which is an important action in climate change emissions, air quality etc.  In that group that has not been paid, 300 of them have been identified who have not submitted the necessary evidence.  They have indicated they are claiming it but they have not submitted the necessary evidence.  They have been contacted and asked to send in the form.<\/p> <p>  There are other issues.  For example, again, to go back to these famous land parcels, if our system finds that there is something different between our record of land parcels and what the claimant has submitted, the matter has to be looked at.  It has to be eyeballed, as we say.  It might be when our staff look at the detail they think they find that it is okay, it is a small issue or they understand why the issue is arising.  It might be that they have to go back to the farmer.  What we are trying to do, and where I will put my hand up a bit, is better communications to the farmers as to what exactly the issue is, and we are trying to deal with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#K02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I was told that the Department's IT was not up and running.

There are some things a human being has to look at to see what is the issue.  The computer will say there is something amiss but a person must engage with it, look at it and examine it.  Some of the cases are quite complex.  In many cases the farmer may need to send us something or something has changed and the computer has identified that and we need to be satisfied that the change is okay.  It may be a slight change in the land parcel area or it might be, for example, that a partnership has been established since the GLAS plan was submitted, and that affects things, or they are flagged in the system.

The Department needs to change its attitude to CEDRA and the whole Department needs to realign itself, given the challenges we face as a country, not just with Brexit but in repositioning our country from the point of view of planning.  I encourage the Department to engage more in this and to try to work more closely with other Departments.  The lack of engagement, funding and overall will from the Department in this area has been astounding.<\/p> <p>  I want to say a few positive things about farm safety, which is a real issue.  I thank the Department for its initiatives in this regard and for the way in which it has co-operated in the programmes.  Unfortunately, expenditure is lower than expected and progress is not happening.  We are having more farm deaths than ever before and I ask the Department to redouble its efforts in this area.  I ask Mr. O'Driscoll to work with the line Minister to find more funding and look at other measures to help.  A chap from Galway was caught in a PTO shaft and lost his leg.  He goes around to schools, takes his prosthetic leg off and puts in on a table to shock the agriscience students in the class.  He is accompanied by a man whose own brother, someone I knew well, died.  We need to redouble our efforts on the schools programme because that is where we affect people.  Younger people have a bigger impact on older people and we need to start on the ground, which is inside schools.  As this chap cannot go around all the time explaining how he lost his leg, we need more funding for this.<\/p> <p>  My next point relates to the intergenerational nature of farming.  We need to get involved in mobile devices and apps.  Farming is seasonal and the safety mechanisms which work in autumn do not necessarily work in summer.  I encourage the Department to look at programmes to address this and I will write with some ideas.  Testimonials on public media, TV and radio are very important and the Department should redouble its efforts to put forward more funding in this area.  People across politics would support the Department in this regard.  It is unfortunate that expenditure is lower than anticipated.

I want to make one or two other points.  I notice in the Department's report, under land mobility measures such as the early retirement and installation aid payment schemes, that the Department paid out &euro;10 million in 2014 on the early retirement scheme.  This decreased to &euro;7 million in 2015.  Obviously, some of the people availing of the scheme are getting the State pension and, consequently, the payment from Mr. O'Driscoll's Department decreases if they clock into that.  I wish to link and relate this to a fact sheet Mr. O'Driscoll sent us on Irish agriculture for January 2017 which refers to farm structure data in Ireland.  The fact sheet refers to 139,000 farm holdings and an average farm size of 32.5 ha.  It details the proportion of family farms held by age and shows that 6% of farms are held by people under 35 years of age.<\/p><p>It states 53% are held by people over 55 years of age.  Therefore, 41% of farms are held by people in the 35 to 55 years age group.  Will Mr. O'Driscoll drill down into those figures and send us information relating to the total farmed land in the country for that age group?  I am seeking data not by the number of farms but by farmed land.<\/p><p> The figures could mask the situation.  While there may be a high percentage of farm owners who are elderly, this might not correspond to the amount of farmed land held by elderly people.  Many older farmers have land below the average farm size.  It would be useful for us.  The figures would be preferable to those for farm holdings, because they do not tell us how much of the farming land in the country is held by the various age cohorts.  I do not expect that Mr. O'Driscoll would have the figures here and now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#Q04300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487235600,"counter":403,"content":"<p>No, we would not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1487235600,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Does Mr. O'Driscoll have that type of information?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017021600002#R00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487235600,"counter":405,"content":"<p>It is possible that we would have to drill into our own systems to provide it.

Several countries have good age structures relating to the farming population.  However, by and large, they have got there through radical means.

We had a long session relating to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on Limerick previously.  The fact is the board is in a difficult financial situation.  We commissioned an Indecon report to examine various things, including governance, financial issues and issues of regulation.  We are trying to deal with those bit by bit.<\/p> <p>  One of the recommendations in the report was that Bord na gCon had to reduce its debt levels and improve its financial situation.  To achieve that, the recommendation was that the board would sell assets.  While the report was not prescriptive about what should be sold, Harold's Cross was one of the assets named.<\/p> <p>  Since 2014, we have known of a recommendation that the track at Harold's Cross would be sold.  Part of the reason is that the asset is likely to have significant value.  Second, it is only 4 km from another flagship stadium.  If we were starting from scratch, we would not plan things that way.  That is the position.<\/p> <p>  The board has been wrestling with this for some time.  It is obviously an emotive issue and has attracted strong feelings on various sides.  The decision on whether to run a track is a matter for the board.  The decision on the sale is a matter for the board.  However, the sale has to be consented to by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is the position.  At the moment the board has made a decision to close the track and sell it.  I do not know whether the local board was consulted.

However, one is also putting a tag on the other side and it is a waste.  It is not a waste, it is an identity tag, but I cannot understand why farmers such as me then have to go back in July and August and then - in my case for 20 cattle every year - put a third tag into them just for genomes.   I am actually tagging a calf that is idle for the year.<\/p><p>I have said this several times and it makes common sense.  One could have a big scheme, especially for the genomes and the genes.  There could be a proper scheme whereby, if a farmer had a spare tag, every female animal in the country could be tested at birth.  I cannot understand why they could not introduce such a scheme for a reasonable cost instead of a farmer having to bring in adult cattle and take 20 cattle samples every year which is another tag in an animal's ear when it could be done at birth, even for the animal's sake.

I join with the Chairman in offering my condolences to the family of former ambassador and senior official, Mr. Lorcan Fullam, who came from a very well known, highly respected and well regarded family in Portarlington in my constituency.  With the Chairman's consent, I would be pleased to convey the condolences of the committee to his family when I meet them later today.<\/p> <p>  In my remarks today I will focus on Vote 28 - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, will later address the committee on Vote 27 - International Co-operation.  I may also ask the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, to take any questions relating to diaspora issues, which is part of his portfolio.<\/p> <p>  Vote 28 funds the operation of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its network of missions, excluding African missions and Vietnam, which fall under Vote 27.  Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to international organisations such as the UN budget, UN peacekeeping operations, OECD, OSCE, Council of Europe and so on, and a number of programmes such as the emigrant support programme and peace and reconciliation fund, and other programmes in areas such as trade promotion, culture and education.  Members will have seen the advance briefing note provided by my Department which summarises the main activities and priorities under each strategic programme.<\/p><p>For 2017 the committee will be aware that the overall gross estimate for the Foreign Affairs and Trade group of Votes, Votes 27 and 28, is &euro;715 million, compared to &euro;702 million in 2015, an overall increase of &euro;13 million or 1.85%.  The increase is in Vote 28, earmarked, in particular, for the passport reform programme, for urgent capital building and security works in our missions abroad, to continue the required investment in modernising the Department's ICT infrastructure and global ICT network and in making some provision for increased operating cost pressures abroad across the diplomatic mission network of some 80 missions across the globe.<\/p><p> The programme structure for Vote 28 has changed slightly from last year to correspond with the Department's new strategy statement for the period 2016 to 2019.  The programme structure mirrors the priorities set out in the foreign policy review document, The Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World, which sets out the Department's work in five priority areas: supporting our people; engaging actively in the European Union; promoting our values; advancing our prosperity; and strengthening our influence.  These correspond directly with expenditure programmes A to E in the 2017 Revised Estimates Volume.  The main change compared with last year is the reordering of programmes B, C and D which were previously programmes D, B and C, respectively.  There have also been some transfers of activities between programmes, including the setting up of a new promoting Ireland programme which is now under programme D3 and which explains some of the variations members see in expenditure on individual programmes compared to 2016.<\/p><p> I will proceed to make some very short introductory comments on programme A.  The amount allocated for this programme in 2017 is &euro;79 million compared to &euro;68 million in 2016.  The bulk of the additional funds secured in 2017 which I mentioned will be spent under this programme which is about our people - Irish citizens at home and abroad - and covers a number of key priority areas for the Department.  Given the breadth of issues covered by the programme, I can only touch briefly on some of them in my short introduction.  I am sure the Chairman will moderate discussions on issues members believe are important to them.<\/p><p> Providing high quality consular assistance and other consular services for Irish citizens at home and abroad is a key objective of the Department.  As members will recall, extensive arrangements were put in place for the tens of thousands of wonderful Irish, including Northern Irish, fans in France for the European championships, as well as those attending the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Brazil.  We responded to major terrorist incidents and launched a new smartphone travel app, Travelwise, which helps to keep Irish citizens informed and safe while abroad.  I encourage members to inform their constituents of this app as it is an important source of information for citizens travelling abroad.<\/p><p> As regards consular priorities in 2017, a new consular strategy is being developed, while a new customer service action plan and consular customer service charter have been adopted.  We expect the trend in recent years of a steady increase in Irish people travelling abroad to continue in 2017 and will continue to plan and prepare for Irish citizens attending major international sports and other events in 2017 in focusing on the preventive piece in our work.<\/p><p> The passport reform programme is important to members in the context of their constituency work.  In 2016 the Department issued 733,000 passports, representing an increase of more than 9% on the figure for 2016.  Applications so far in 2017 are already over 20% ahead of the number in the corresponding period last year.  The increase in demand is driven by various factors: a general increase in the number of Irish citizens travelling abroad; a growing population; and a significant rise in application numbers from Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  As members may know, just over a year ago I launched a significant investment in the passport service to modernise the issue of passports, improve security and enhance the service provided for citizens.  The passport reform programme runs from 2016 to 2018 and involves a combined capital and current budget of &euro;18.6 million.  Nearly &euro;8 million has been allocated for the programme in 2017.  I acknowledge the professionalism and sense of customer service of Austin Gormley and his team at the Passport Office.  One of the most significant innovations will be the introduction in the coming months of an online passport renewal option for adults which will reduce the administrative burden for citizens and improve the overall efficiency of the service.  I expect to make a further announcement on this innovation in the next few weeks.<\/p><p> The next heading is the emigrant support programme and diaspora issues which are being handled by Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Joe McHugh.  In relation to Irish communities and individuals abroad, our active work continues to support our most vulnerable emigrants and implement the wider objectives of the Government&rsquo;s diaspora policy document.  Our vision continues to be having a vibrant, diverse global Irish community, connected to Ireland and to each other.  I am pleased that the budget allocation to support emigrant communities and wider diaspora engagement remains at &euro;11.595 million for the emigrant support programme and a further &euro;400,000 for diaspora affairs, responsibility for which has been transferred to my Department from the Department of the Taoiseach.  I commend the work of my colleague, Deputy Joe McHugh, in this important area in his role as Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora.  He will take questions members have on these matters.<\/p><p> The Northern Ireland programme deals with matters relating to Northern Ireland and delivers funding for projects to bolster peace and reconciliation on the island.  The interests of the island as a whole and protecting the gains of the peace process will remain a priority for the Government in the upcoming Brexit negotiations.  The Government's priority is to ensure the Good Friday Agreement and the overall balance of the settlement will not in any way be disturbed by the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union and to maintain the open and, effectively, invisible border.  <\/p><p> The next topic is the reconciliation fund and the related issue of commemorations.  Although significant progress has occurred in Northern Ireland, there is still important reconciliation work to be done.  The reconciliation fund of &euro;2.7 million is an important expression of our support for this work.  Recognising the contribution commemorations can make and drawing on successes in this regard last year, we will support in 2017 the commemoration of Irish involvement in the battle of Messines.  <\/p><p> I would welcome the comments of the Chairman and members on programme A.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#A00500","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I ask members and all those present to make sure their mobile phones are turned off, as they are interfering with the broadcasting and recording equipment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#B00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I compliment the Passport Office, the officers of which are absolutely brilliant.

Most people have a car and they receive a letter or an e-mail to advise that their motor tax is due for renewal.

Perhaps the Minister might elaborate on them a little.  Embassies and other buildings need to be continually upgraded.

How will this pan out in the future?

It was positive and progressive to see the work of our embassy there under the ambassador, H.E. Vincent O'Neill and the work he is doing to promote Ireland in so many ways.  There was an interesting exhibition there about the Irish in Kenya, which was organised by a group of people.

I have read the Minister's statement and wish to raise two points.  I am sure the Department was aware that there would be an increase in passport applications.  I heard on the media this morning that the Minister intends to employ additional staff in the passport service, although that is not specifically alluded to in his address.  How many extra staff does he intend to employ?  Will he be re-employing those who worked there temporarily over the summer and who are already trained?  There is a huge issue with passports at the moment.  The Minister and the Minister of State will know that, as I have been plaguing them about it.  It is a serious matter.  What is the Department doing about the customer service element in advising people of the revised lead times?  That is also a big issue.<\/p> <p>  How many staff is the Minister going to employ and how soon does he hope to have them in place?  My colleague, Senator Robbie Gallagher, has written to the Minister about opening a sub-office in the Cavan-Monaghan area, so are there any plans to open another passport office?<\/p> <p>  Sub-head A6 concerns North-South, Anglo-Irish co-operation, but there is no increase in funding between 2016 and 2017.  Given that the UK is in the process of exiting the EU and given the political situation in the North, is the Minister satisfied that there is no increase in funding in that area?  I would have thought that is something that will keep the Department particularly busy over the coming year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#C01200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I also wish to record my appreciation for the work of staff in the Passport Office.

Immigration reform and the political situation in the United States is of concern to many families throughout this country, given the undocumented Irish in the US.  Following the Minister's recent visit there, can he see any reasons for optimism about immigration reform in the US?<\/p> <p>  The Peace and Reconciliation Programme has been valuable for the most disadvantaged communities in Northern Ireland and the Border area generally.  Could any available funding be rolled out as early as possible this year?  Many communities in Northern Ireland feel vulnerable at this stage.  We cannot quantify the angst and worry for such communities due to the referendum decision on the UK's membership of the EU.  A clear message should be sent that our support for various projects will continue.  I acknowledge the interaction of the Minister and his ministerial colleague, Deputy Donohoe, at the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  We must give strong reassurances that the various programmes funded by the Department and through INTERREG and the peace programmes, will be continued beyond 2020.  A message must go out to communities that the valuable supports and programmes that have been in place since the late 1990s will be continued.  Many of the most disadvantaged communities have benefitted from those programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#C01300","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I will deal with the last point first.  The Chairman made a good point regarding the importance of funding from the Peace and Reconciliation Fund.  I acknowledge the Chairman's comments.  It is a vitally important source of funding for many communities that are still suffering from division and are recovering in a post-conflict society.  I take the Chairman's point about the early disbursement of funding, but he will be aware that we receive hundreds of applications.  It is important that each and every application is gone through in order to ensure that they meet the strict criteria involved.<\/p> <p>  We currently have two funding rounds a year.  New applicants are always welcome alongside many of the more established organisations that have benefited and continue to do very good work.  The closing date for the receipt of applications for the next round of funding is 10 March, which is approaching.  I therefore ask committee members to alert any interested parties at the earliest opportunity.  After that March round, the second round will be open in the autumn.<\/p><p>I remind members and all interested parties that full details and information regarding the fund and the criteria in respect of application and the manner in which the application can be made are available on the website.<\/p><p> Deputies Grealish, McLoughlin and Darragh O'Brien asked about passports.  Deputy O'Brien mentioned that the central passport location is situated in his constituency.  All Deputies will be aware that volumes of passport applications are particularly high at the moment.  Deputy Grealish is right in his contention that public representatives should continue to ensure there is a public information campaign that asks people to check their validity of their passports and those of their children.  I know the Passport Office will continue to do this.  People need to be able to choose the correct passport channel.  I think that has given rise to issues in recent times.  It is stated on the application form and the website that applicants should not book their travel plans until they have received their passports.  My advice continues to be that applicants should allow six weeks for the receipt of their passports in order to ensure there is no disappointment.  Queries often arise with regard to application forms.  Documentation can be incomplete, or the quality of the photograph might not be sufficient to meet the appropriate security requirements.  I advise people to allow six weeks.<\/p><p> I remind Deputies that citizens who are travelling in three weeks or more can avail of the convenient and cost-effective passport express facility, which is available through post offices.  At a time when rural Deputies are concerned about the future viability of rural post offices, it is important that this service is provided for through all post offices here and 70 post offices in Northern Ireland.  It is important for it to be adequately recognised that the current turnaround time for renewal applications made through the passport express facility is 15 working days and not five or ten working days.  I ask applicants for passport renewals to regard 15 working days as the appropriate time they should allow to ensure their new passports can be issued and returned to them in time.  First-time applications take a little longer due to the additional security checks that are required.  In addition to the orthodox passport application area and the passport express facility, a third stream is available to those who need to travel at short notice.  We hope to be able to provide a satisfactory outcome in such circumstances within the timeframe that is sought.  We advise people who need to make emergency or urgent applications to go online to book an appointment at one of the passport offices in Dublin and Cork.<\/p><p> I acknowledge that this is a very important issue for public representatives.  As a Deputy who represents a rural constituency, I am aware that this engagement forms a considerable part of our duties.  Later this spring, we will announce online improvements which should considerably benefit citizens in making online applications for passport renewals.  I note Deputy Grealish's point regarding e-mail responses.  I accept it is important for us to work in that area.  We intend to ensure a first-class customer service is available to people who do not have e-mail accounts or may not be living in close proximity to passport offices.  The capital funding mentioned by Deputy Darragh O'Brien will allow for the installation of the new advanced computer system.  We have received very positive feedback from the public about our new building - Knockmaun House - and its surrounds in Mount Street and the level of efficiency there.  At a time when application numbers are high, the staff of the Passport Office and the Department are endeavouring to ensure a first-class level of service is offered to all applicants.<\/p><p> Reference was made to a spike in passport applications.  I acknowledge that there has been an increase.  We do not ask people who are filling in passport application forms to state the reasons they are making such applications.  Our concern is to ascertain whether people qualify for Irish passports.  It is fair to say that there has been a considerable degree of new-found interest in passport applications from Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Most passport applications from both sides of the Border are made through the post office network.  That remains the most efficient and effective way to apply for a passport.  Applications can be submitted through all post offices in this jurisdiction and up to 70 post offices across Northern Ireland.  An online option for passport renewal will be offered to citizens in the next few months.<\/p><p> I am satisfied that the existing range of service options meets the current needs of passport applicants.  I am not convinced by the arguments made in favour of the proposal to locate new passport offices in certain parts of the country, including those mentioned by Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  Proposals have also been made in respect of other parts of the country and places outside this jurisdiction.  I am confident that the introduction of the online passport application option will result in an even greater level of efficiency.  We will have an opportunity to test this later in the year.  I am confident that turnaround times will be reduced further, even in the context of additional applications.  I will be happy to keep the matter under review and to take guidance at any point from this committee and its members.<\/p><p> The proposed withdrawal of the UK from the EU presents us with a monumental challenge over a range of issues, including our invisible Border.  I can say in response to the Deputies who asked about the Border that I have raised this issue in my discussions with the UK Foreign Secretary, Mr. Johnson, MP, and the UK Secretary of State for Leaving the European Union, Mr. Davis, MP, who was in Ireland before Christmas.  I am in ongoing discussions on this issue with the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, MP, who was in Dublin on Tuesday.  I am satisfied that our concerns in this regard have been fully accepted, acknowledged and realised by my UK counterparts.  It was significant that in her statement introducing the White Paper that was published by the British Government recently, the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, specifically referenced Northern Ireland and the Border issues.<\/p><p> I am aware of the concerns and anxieties in the Border area, particularly in the constituencies of the Chairman and Deputy McLoughlin.  This issue is a priority for the Government.  We have raised it in our discussions with our UK counterparts.  I have raised it with each of my foreign minister colleagues across the EU.  The peace process is of fundamental importance.  Anything that has an adverse impact on the Good Friday Agreement, or disrupts it in any way, will be wholly unacceptable to the Irish Government.  Members will be aware of the excellent great strides that have been made in North-South relations since the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>These strides have been possible because of the invisible nature of the Border that I crossed only last Saturday travelling from Carlingford in County Louth along a minor road into Newry.  Members will be aware of the invisible nature of the Border and I have sensitised all my European Union colleagues to that effect.  I am satisfied the British Government is aware of the position and we must work towards that.  That is in the context of negotiations, which, incidentally, have not yet started.  We are not negotiating with the British and we will be negotiating firmly with the EU 27.  This issue will form part of the negotiations.  Ultimately, it is not something that will be decided by ourselves and the British Government but it will be decided in the context of the negotiation between the European Union and the UK.<\/p><p> Deputy Darragh O'Brien made a point regarding funding.  The North-South Ministerial Council is not currently operating in the manner in which we all would have expected because of the electoral cycle in Northern Ireland and we are now in an election process.  I call on all parties involved with the election campaigning that as soon as the results are announced with the votes counted, everybody elected and their respective party leaders should sit around the table at the earliest opportunity to ensure that an Executive can be up and running in a positive and constructive way in Northern Ireland.  It is important in itself in the context of the Agreement but there are specific Brexit issues that must be addressed.  I am satisfied the level of funding to allow for North-South engagement in the matter of Brexit is sufficient.  I acknowledge what is implicit in the Deputy's question, which is the need to ensure we have an intense level of engagement with our UK colleagues and Northern colleagues in the new Executive in order to ensure the priorities of the Irish Government from an all-island perspective are fully appreciated.  Those include the maintenance of an invisible Border.<\/p><p> I will revert to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's issues in the appropriate programme.  I do not envisage cases where our funding will not be continued on the basis of our proposals.  We keep our embassy complement under review.  There were a number of specific areas where urgent works were required in terms of the safety of buildings; I refer in particular to a programme of work in Paris.  There are also a number of embassies where for security reasons we need to update the buildings and their curtilage.  That is having regard to a number of international terrorist attacks and we must ensure our people and their teams are safe.  That is an ongoing programme but we highlight areas of urgency and importance.  Funding is always a matter of challenge in that regard and our embassy network forms part of our ongoing engagement with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  On the matter of new embassies, such issues are always under review.  In the context of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, our longer-term review issues might now be subject to a shorter-term review.  We must intensify our markets overseas and that will involve the development of further programmes launching early next month.  There is also the matter of our trade priorities for the year and we can consider new embassies that we opened in the past 18 months.  In this context I refer to areas such as Nairobi in Kenya, Austin in Texas, Hong Kong, Jakarta in Indonesia and Bangkok in Thailand.  There are already reports coming in from these embassies that demonstrate a significant amount of activity in terms of bilateral relations with these countries with particular reference to trade and economic development.  I will be happy to keep the committee fully informed in that regard.  We are looking at other areas.  This committee and Members asking foreign affairs questions in the Chamber have made me aware of the political, economic and trade factors with particular reference to Iran and this is under review in line with other areas.  In the meantime, the embassy of Ireland in Ankara in Turkey has accreditation to Iran.  We are represented in Iran by an honorary consul but we will continue to review matters, having regard to the range of factors we have in considering our diplomatic representation overseas.  Deputy Grealish made an important point about our relationship with the UK.  In countries where we do not have a resident full-time mission, consular engagement in that regard has been very important and that will continue.  However, our relationship with the UK is not the only one we have with like-minded countries.  I acknowledge the assistance we get in many countries from the French and German Governments, for example, as well as other EU Governments.  I make specific reference, however, to the important engagement and relationship that we have with our nearest neighbour.<\/p><p> I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, to deal with diaspora issues and the undocumented Irish in the US.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#C01400","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":605,"content":"<p>Deputy Grealish mentioned the cultural centre in Boston and I had the pleasure of being there last year.

With regard to the funding for this year, the applications closed yesterday and there will be approximately 400 projects from 200 organisations to be evaluated.  I do not know if Boston is in that group but I can find out.  The Deputy can ask the group to stay in touch with us and our officials and let us know what are the specific plans.  As I mentioned, the group is ambitious and has a fantastic facility.  The Deputy has been there and knows about the football pitches.  They have brought in different types of activities for young people and it is a great model that we should promote for other centres around the world.  It is inclusive and it addresses the generational gap as many centres and communities in the United States find it difficult to get young Irish people involved.  That is a great model.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned the undocumented and, as I mentioned, 70% of the funding goes to welfare organisations that support the undocumented.  We are looking at extra funding for that.  I have been to San Francisco, New York and Boston already and have been working very closely with those organisations.<\/p><p> At a political level, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade visited Washington from late January to early February, where he met representatives from both sides of the US Senate and Congress.  His meetings are a critically important part of the strategic approach that we have adopted to the issue of the undocumented Irish.  Ms Anne Anderson, the Irish ambassador to the United States, held a meeting on 12 January that was attended by Senator Billy Lawless and representatives of all our consulates.  The Department has adopted a strategic follow-up approach rather than a piecemeal or one-off approach.  While I do not want to create an expectation for the undocumented Irish, I note that prior to the new Administration taking office there was fear about the J1 programme.  Last night, however, extra J1 places were announced.  The point is we have a rich American-Irish relationship that the Minister has nurtured on a weekly basis.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#E00600","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":611,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comments.

Not everything RTE says is true but it might be in this instance.<\/p> <p>  I wish to comment on the embassy network.  Recently Deputy Grealish and I visited Egypt.  I want to put it on the record of the House that any time Members of the Oireachtas travel abroad the Irish consular service and people who work in our embassies do exceptional work.  In Egypt a small Irish team comprised of an ambassador and consular staff do a superb job in a very difficult situation.  Deputy Grealish and I saw at first hand the additional security measures that are required in Cairo.  It is not the easiest of working environments.  On my own behalf I wish to express my gratitude to the consular service and embassy staff for the work that they do all over the world.  I would like to get a handle on how much it costs to provide a service.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the importance of the J1 visa programme and like him, I welcome the additional visas.  Yesterday I mentioned the undocumented Irish to the Minister in the D&aacute;il.  What is our approach to the undocumented Irish?  Perhaps this is not the correct forum to discuss the matter.  Are reciprocal visa arrangements along the lines of the Australian deal being considered?  Is Ireland still in the overall group of the 12 million illegal or undocumented people in America?  Has the Minister sought a specific bilateral arrangement for Ireland?  I appreciate that the new Administration is in existence for a short time.  What is our approach now?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#F00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I shall allow Deputy Grealish to make a short comment.

A passport is the most important document that a person can have yet it can be renewed online or through the post office.  One must show up in person at a particular office to collect a driver licence.  It is a huge problem for Irish people who live abroad.  Recently I was in Boston to attend a wedding and four young people approached me to tell me they had no driver licences.  In America when a police officer stops a person the first thing he or she will ask for is a driver licence.  People abroad cannot get a driver licence unless they come home and present themselves at the appropriate office.  I ask the Minister and Minister of State to ask the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to put a system in place that caters for Irish people who are abroad, particularly the undocumented Irish people who are in the United States.  They are particularly worried now due to the pledge by President Trump to tackle the problem of illegal people in the United States.

I am dealing with the case of a young girl who is undocumented and living in America.  Unfortunately, she lost her driver licence in America.  People can replace their passport and buy it online yet the same cannot be done for a driver licence.  Local authorities no longer issue driver licences.  The National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, has made no effort to accommodate the people abroad who wish to renew their driver licences.  People need their driver licences because they need to drive in the United States and elsewhere.  The NDLS will not accept it when people say they have mislaid or lost their driver licences.  A driver licence will only be issued after people return home, submit an application, have a photograph taken and return to the United States.  It is impossible to do all of that, particularly for the 50,000 undocumented Irish who live in the United States.  As I said yesterday, many of these people are very concerned and afraid because of what has been done and said by the new regime in the United States.

I had a number of meetings in Washington and I shall mention my meeting with the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Mr. Paul Ryan.  For many years he has been familiar with the undocumented Irish and I acknowledge his support.<\/p> <p>  It is early days for the new Administration in the United States and we cannot say for certain what the programme of work will be for the coming year.  I can tell members that Mr. Paul Ryan said to me, having regard to his influential position as Speaker, that he expects that the undocumented will be tabled on the agenda in the latter half of this year.  I agree with Deputy O'Brien that it is early days for the US Administration.  I felt that it was important for me to avail of an early opportunity in the life of the Administration to speak to figures who will play an important role.  We will keep in contact with the US Administration at the highest level.  I cite the Taoiseach's visit for St. Patrick's Day and note the opposing commentary on same.  It is important that the Taoiseach avails of every opportunity, as do all Ministers, as well as members, including this committee, to contact people who we believe will be in a position to advocate, assist and help resolve this issue that has lasted for a number of decades.  I am happy to keep the committee fully informed about the matter.  I note that individual members, as well as this committee collectively, will have an opportunity to continue what is a very important engagement.<\/p> <p>  Irish people who have lived in the United States for many years are stakeholders in the United States on the basis that they pay their taxes, raise their families and engage in business, commerce and trade.  While they are an integral part of US society and contribute to the US economy, their papers are such as to give rise to very serious concerns on their part as to their status and future.  It is important that the situation is fully recognised in the context of whatever legislative changes are brought forward.  The indications are that this may happen this year. <\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Brien raised two specific issues about budgets and staffing.  Over the coming months in excess of 230 temporary clerical officers will be recruited for the Passport Office.  Many of them will have previously worked in the Passport Office, which is important in the context of training and efficiencies.  That is the expectation but the situation is always under review.<\/p><p> On the matter of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, members will be aware of the reconfigured nature of Departments internally.  I refer to both the Department of the Taoiseach and my Department.  We now have a dedicated Brexit unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and we have managed to increase our footprint in the form of personnel, particularly in our PermRep in Brussels.  Consideration is being given to embassies in London, Paris and Berlin.  On the matter of London, I acknowledge the increased presence on the ground of agencies such as IDA Ireland and our embassy to ensure we maximise opportunities that may arise on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.<\/p><p> It is fair to say we have all been concentrating on the adverse impact and the negatives.  I do not envisage much of an upside for anybody on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  I said that during the course of the campaign and since the referendum.  I respect fully the wishes of the British people as expressed in the referendum.  It could well be, in the context of the withdrawal, that there will be an opportunity for Ireland, especially in financial services and related areas.  We have augmented our agency staff to ensure we are prepared for these opportunities as they arise.  More than 600 people attended a very successful financial services day or seminar in Dublin Castle recently.  It was addressed by the Taoiseach and Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who has been particularly active in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#F01300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Some of this has already been addressed.  The focus of work under the programme will be on safeguarding Ireland's interests in the broader context of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union and the negotiations we expect to commence properly later this spring.  The allocation for this programme in 2017 is &euro;23.3 million, compared with &euro;19.3 million in 2016.  That is an increase of &euro;3 million, which reflects the priority attached to Brexit.<\/p> <p>  The Government is under no illusion about the nature and scale of the Brexit challenge.  Our preparations began more than two years ago.  We enter the negotiations in a position of strength.  Within my Department, a team of experienced senior officials, both in Dublin and abroad, is continuing to prepare intensively for what will be complex and detailed negotiations.  Additional capabilities and resources are being assigned to cover the complex process of the withdrawal.  Within the Department, additional resources have been assigned to the two key divisions, the EU division and the Ireland, UK and the Americas division, IUKA.  In addition to extra posts at headquarters, specific additional staff have been assigned to our embassies in London, Berlin and Paris in addition to Brussels, as I stated.  Every Department has developed a thorough impact assessment or analysis of the critical issues that need to be addressed.  I have referred in the D&aacute;il and this committee to my engagement at EU level.  I will be happy to take questions in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Darragh O'Brien should note an allocation of &euro;325,000 is included under this programme to support our EU engagement.

I hope there will be adequate resources to deal with this very important issue.<\/p> <p>  When colleagues of the Minister from the Foreign Affairs Council visit this country and are meeting, I hope they will go outside the capital to the Border.  I welcome the fact the President of the Bundestag is visiting the Border area next week.  He will be in the Dundalk area along with colleagues from the Bundestag.  While we can all read memos and files and go to capital cities and hear about the challenges facing countries, there is nothing to beat going to the coalface and meeting the people who will be directly affected by what will happen in a few years.  I acknowledge there are time constraints when Ministers visit other countries but I hope that, where possible, colleagues and people of influence from other member states will be brought to the Border.  Let them see that we have, thankfully, made so much progress and that we do not want to undo it.

That is crucial.  I know he intends to keep that engagement going.  How many bilateral meetings does the Taoiseach have left to do with his counterparts?  I understand from questions to him yesterday that he may have done one third of the meetings.  What plans are there to ramp up this process?  It is difficult when he has to keep his eye on things here and abroad but anyway, that is crucial.<\/p> <p>  Does the Minister have an indication of the position from the British Government?  The British Government had mentioned March as the time to table the Article 50 letter.  Has the British Government given an indication as to whether the date will be put back somewhat?  What is the EU's view?  I get a sense that the EU is pushing to have this dealt with far quicker.<\/p> <p>  Another question relates to the special status for Northern Ireland.  I met the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland the day before yesterday.  I put it to him that I and my party were particularly disappointed and dismayed that the British had rejected out of hand any notion of special status for Northern Ireland.  I asked the Minister this question yesterday.  I am trying to clarify the position of the Irish Government on special status for Northern Ireland.  I took it from our debate in the D&aacute;il yesterday that we seem to be in agreement with the British on that point.  I hope that is not the case.<\/p> <p>  I have another question on the trade side following from the remarks of Deputy McLoughlin.  This area is crucial as well.  While there are many risks to all sectors, there also are many opportunities.  How is the Department tracking the various issues in each sector?  This is a vast issue.  Deputy McLoughlin referred to haulage but this applies to any sector.  I met representatives from Horse Racing Ireland last week.  Some things we would never think about are impacted because of Brexit.  Is an inventory of the issues in the various sectors being updated on a regular basis?  How is the Department tracking things to be able to deal with them?  I will not even go into examples because the Minister knows what I am talking about.  Anyway, it is vast and I still am concerned that we do not have the resources.  While an additional &euro;325,000 appears to have been allocated to support EU engagement, who is keeping the ledger in respect of resources on the administrative side in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?  Who is keeping an inventory of the various issues with which every Department must deal?  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#H00100","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I will deal with the question raised by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan first, in which she made reference to the number of organisations under the programme to which we make a contribution.  The organisation with the greatest emphasis in this regard, perhaps, is the United Nations.  This is crucial to our people.  In none of our engagements with any of these international committees or organisations has the issue of Irish neutrality been in any way compromised.  Our position regarding our non-aligned status and the fact that we are not members of any military organisation are accepted among the international community.<\/p> <p>  We have seen the publication in recent times of our new foreign policy review and strategic plan.  Specific reference is made to Ireland's neutral status.  Our engagement with the EU common security and defence policy, CSDP, is an integral part of the foreign and security policy of the European Union.  It provides the European Union with operational capacity to undertake missions outside the European Union for peacekeeping, conflict prevention and the strengthening of international security in accordance with clearly laid down principles of the United Nations contained in a charter.  We remain strong supporters of CSDP initiatives, which continue to improve the capacity of the European Union to make contributions to international security, peace and stability, especially in the context of support for the United Nations.  In this regard, we will continue to work closely with EU member states.  However, I wish to assure Deputy O'Sullivan, as I have done on numerous occasions previously, of the importance and the international recognition of our stated status of being militarily neutral.<\/p> <p>  I am keen to address the Chairman's important and positive suggestion.  He suggested that international visitors, especially EU foreign ministers, who will have an important role to play in the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union, might have an opportunity to visit a Border area.  I think that is an excellent suggestion and I would be happy to follow up on that.  I am expecting a visit shortly from the EU foreign minister from Luxembourg.  I would be happy to give consideration to arranging a visit for him to a Border area.  He comes from a small but nevertheless influential state in the European Union.  Indeed, it is one of the founding members.  Luxembourg experiences in excess of 50,000 people per day crossing the invisible borders from Germany, Belgium and France for work, education and engagement.  I would be happy to try to arrange an opportunity for him to visit a Border area.<\/p> <p>  Last week, I had the opportunity for the first time to meet the key European Parliament figure, Guy Verhofstadt, on a bilateral basis.  I issued a formal invitation to him to visit Ireland and engage.  This may be an opportunity to invite Mr. Verhofstadt to address the committee.  Again, in the context of his visit, I would be happy to make arrangements or to suggest that he might visit a Border area, perhaps even in your constituency, Chairman.  The same could apply if we have an opportunity with the chief negotiator, Mr. Barnier, at some stage.  He has been to Dublin for formal meetings.  I think it would be appropriate that all the key figures visiting Ireland would have an opportunity to see a practical demonstration of the invisible Border.  This arises in the context of the peace process and the fact that since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, the North-South relationships in terms of relations among people, trade, commerce, business, education and health are such that the maintenance of that Border is of major national importance for us.<\/p> <p>  This leads me to the question from Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  Our priorities in these negotiations are to ensure that the seamless frictionless invisible Border continues, that nothing adverse to current arrangements will arise and that the unique circumstances derived from the Good Friday Agreement and the particular circumstances relating to North and South would be fully recognised in the context of the negotiations.  We will be entering into these negotiations from an all-island perspective.  It will involve impressing on our EU colleagues, as well as those from the UK, the unique circumstances that will be required in respect of the final negotiated framework.<\/p> <p>  On Tuesday, I raised the matter of the timeframe for Article 50 with the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Brokenshire.  He confirmed that matters are still on track having regard to the judicial aspect of things, which has been dealt with and the parliamentary debate, which has taken place.  It would appear to be still very much the desire of the British Government that the Article 50 invocation will take place before the end of March.<\/p><p> I wish to make a final comment on our engagement with the EU.  I acknowledge the Chairman's welcome suggestion.  St. Patrick's Day represents another opportunity where Ministers travelling abroad will be involved in engagements.  One of the aspects of the Patrick's Day celebrations this year will be that every Minister who travels abroad will be required to have a Brexit meeting in some respect and inform persons with whom they are engaging of the importance of Ireland's position within the European Union and that irrespective of the vote of the British people, Ireland will not be leaving the European Union but that the unique and special circumstances on the island of Ireland needs to be fully recognised.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach has met a number of his EU prime-ministerial colleagues and I have met all of mine.  St. Patrick's Day presents further opportunities.  I would be very happy to keep Deputy Darragh O'Brien and other members informed.  At this stage I have clocked up in excess of 100 bilateral meetings on the matter of the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.  The central co-ordinating point is in the Department of the Taoiseach in respect of that analysis and the impact assessment across a range of Departments.  The Brexit Cabinet committee is meeting again this evening.  I again make clear the intent on the part of the Government that the chairmen of these committees and Opposition spokespersons and party leaders be fully informed.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy McLoughlin, it is important that as public representatives, we all avail of the opportunity of listening to people and engaging with stakeholders in the manner in which he suggested.  He mentioned agriculture and haulage.  This week I attended a meeting in Galway attended by 250 people, all of whom have anxieties and concerns.  I know all the political parties are engaged, as is this committee.  There is a duty and burden on every one of us, as public representatives, to engage with our citizens and stakeholders in order that we are fully apprised of the issues to help us in the negotiations.<\/p><p> We have done a huge amount of preparation.  We are ready for these negotiations.  We go into them in a very positive frame of mind and with a positive disposition.  The Irish people faced very serious challenges in the past.  We have a very experienced team in Brussels.  We have spoken to Mr. Barnier on a range of issues - I met him as recently as last week.  He is in no doubt as to the unique and special circumstances relating to the island of Ireland, our peace process and our trade links.  We go into these negotiations very much prepared but not in any way underestimating what is a serious and difficult challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#H00200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I appreciate that the Minister has kept us informed of the meetings happening within the Department.

We need to maintain the common travel area, east-west as well as North-South.<\/p> <p>  On the particular point the Deputy raises regarding the need to impress upon our EU colleagues in the negotiations, while the people in Northern Ireland actually voted to remain within the European Union, any special status for Northern Ireland within the European Union is something that to my mind is unachievable for a number of reasons, not least of which is that the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and her entire Cabinet have said on a number of occasions that they intend withdrawing the UK from the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#J00500","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":637,"content":"<p>We need to move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#J00600","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":638,"content":"<p>I understand that, Chairman.<\/p> <p>  I understand what the Minister is saying, which is that because it would be difficult to achieve, we are not going to try.

The EU will understand that it is unique.  There are difficulties with Spain and other countries.

Over 71% of current expenditure under this programme is made up of contributions to international organisations.<\/p> <p>  On UN and other contributions, my Department&rsquo;s commitment to international peace, security and human rights is channelled through programme C, which has a total allocation of &euro;55.8 million in 2017.<\/p><p>This compares with &euro;60.4 million in 2016 and represents a reduction of &euro;4.6 million on the Revised 2016 Estimates, which were increased last November, as committee members will recall, by way of a technical Supplementary Estimate to cover additional contributions to the UN, in particular relating to peacekeeping, and to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, to meet Ireland's full obligations in 2016 to these organisations.<\/p><p> Much of the expenditure under this programme relates to Ireland&rsquo;s mandatory contributions to international organisations of which we are a member, including the United Nations.  The 2017 Estimates reflect the best estimate, at this time, of mandatory contributions due in 2017.  It should be noted, however, as we saw last year, that the challenge in forecasting the UN peacekeeping budget in particular, which is the largest part of our payments to the UN, is never an easy one.  It is difficult to estimate this in advance as existing peacekeeping operations may be expanded, reduced or further developed, depending on the circumstances, or a new one might be established.  In addition, UN contributions are invoiced in US dollars and therefore are subject to currency fluctuations.<\/p><p> Ireland is seeking election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in June 2020 for the 2021 to 2022 term, a candidacy we declared in 2005.  We will base our campaign on Ireland's foreign policy credentials and strong international standing at the UN.  We continue to engage closely with the UN and other multilateral partners, such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe, which is very important to us.  We make contributions to the work of our multilateral partners in targeted policy areas, including peacekeeping, conflict resolution and conflict prevention, international development, disarmament and UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security.  We will continue our efforts to make the UN and other multilateral institutions more effective in facing global, regional and development challenges.<\/p><p> Disarmament and non-proliferation issues will remain a priority in 2017, building on our active engagement and participation in the international disarmament and non-proliferation process.  Ireland will play an active role in negotiations at a forthcoming UN-mandated diplomatic conference to negotiate a new legal instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading to their total elimination.  These negotiations will begin in New York next month.<\/p><p> We continue to advance human rights priorities, building on our successful membership and solid record of achievements at the UN Human Rights Council following our two-year term on the council which ended in 2015.<\/p><p> A key pillar of our international engagement under programme C is our input into the shaping and formulation of the European Union's common foreign and security policy, CFSP, most notably at the monthly meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council in which I participate and to which I made reference earlier in my reply to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.<\/p><p> There is no denying this is a time of great concern and some frustration for the Middle East peace process.  The process has somewhat stalled.  We will continue to argue for strengthened international focus and more intensive international action, in the first instance through our membership of the EU.  This is what I have been doing at the Foreign Affairs Council, most recently in the meetings in January and February.  I was pleased to participate as an invitee to an international Middle East peace process conference in Paris in January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#J01000","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I have a particular interest in the Middle East and I hope the committee will have an opportunity to visit, as I have, the refugee camps in northern Lebanon to see the hundreds of thousands of Christians who have been displaced from Syria.  The two major superpowers are squaring up to each other in the Middle East, and whatever will happen now with the election of Trump?  Peace in the Middle East must come from within the Middle East.  What contact has been made at EU level with the Iranian Government?  Iran has a population of 180 million and has a major role to play in bringing peace and stability to the Middle East.  I do not believe the two superpowers will achieve it.  Has any contact been made at EU level or by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with Iran?  The Minister touched on it, and I tabled a parliamentary question recently, on whether the Minister had any proposals to open an embassy in Iran.  It is a country with which we should start to foster relations, particularly now sanctions have been lifted, although it is difficult to know what Trump will do.  It has a major role to play in bringing peace and stability to the Middle East, which must come from within the Middle East.  What contact does the Department have with Middle Eastern governments to ascertain whether a resolution can be proposed?  Are there proposals at EU level to try to bring peace there?

I support the ongoing work of our Defence Forces in peacekeeping throughout the world.  They are a credit to the country and we are all very proud of them.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the human rights element to which the Minister alluded, what is Ireland's view on the proposed third country arrangements between the EU and Libya?  I have been critical of the arrangement with Turkey but the idea of sending refugees back to Libya is absolutely crazy.  With regard to Afghanistan, an EU memo on the forced resettlement of people back to that country was leaked.  In my view this would be in breach of the Geneva Convention and I note 16 other third country arrangements are in preparation.  The Minister has said previously, in response to questions from me in the D&aacute;il, that in broad terms the Government supports these arrangements, which I consider to be a mistake.  What is Ireland's view on this proposed arrangement and future arrangements?<\/p> <p>  I am very interested to hear about our ongoing effort to win a seat on the UN Security Council.  Deputy Grealish and I met the Secretary General of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, at the beginning of January, and many Arab countries are very well disposed towards us.  Peacekeeping was mentioned specifically by the Secretary General in an extensive meeting, which was also attended by the Ceann Comhairle and members of the Minister's party.  It is interesting there is goodwill towards us.  Will the Minister tell us how it is going at present?<\/p> <p>  The Minister knows my views on the Middle East peace process.  Has the Department relayed officially the absolute displeasure and concern of the Irish Government and the D&aacute;il at the heightened measure of building on Palestinian lands?  In recent weeks 6,000 additional homes were announced.  A vote in the Knesset, which will be taken to court in Israel, would retrospectively legalise illegal settlements in the Palestinian occupied territories.  I firmly believe, and I know it is in the programme for Government and has been included in the programmes of successive Governments, that a two-state solution is absolutely the way forward.  Most of us agree with this.  My concern is there will be nothing left to recognise if this is allowed to continue.<\/p> <p>  We also had the discussions yesterday between President Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, from which the indications were that for the US Administration, the two-state solution effectively is not that important and everything relates to Israel.  In no way, shape or form have I ever tried to antagonise or am antagonising the Israelis.  I fully respect Israel and we have full diplomatic ties with Israel but it is about time Ireland got off the fence and moved to recognise officially the state of Palestine as part of a two-state solution.  It is in the programme for Government.  The D&aacute;il and Seanad passed a motion in 2014.<\/p><p>I, and most of my Opposition colleagues, tabled a motion last June which is based on the 2014 motion with which the Minister's party agreed.  I would like to get an update on that.  I do not want the House to divide on such an issue.  It is about time this country made a stand and said that what is occurring in the Palestinian territories is simply wrong.

Our influence as a small state has been well recognised.  It is not a new-found influence; it recognises the steadfast support of the international organisations by the Irish people and by successive Governments over many years.  We make our priorities known in many ways for many of the programmes.  The Irish influence is evident.  Yes, the organisations produce annual reports with reference to the programmes and I am sure the reports can be made available to the committee at any time.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Grealish spoke about relations with Iran.  To add to what I said earlier, our representative in Ankara has current responsibility for our engagement with Iran and we also have an active honorary consul in Tehran.  We keep under review the matter of a more positive presence or level of engagement.  Having regard to the changed circumstances in Iran, there is a desire now, not only on Ireland's part but on the part of the European Union and the international community to work towards improved relations with Iran.  Last year's visit by EU High Representative Mogherini to Tehran was important.  We continue at EU level to ensure that we look at a greater level of opportunity in terms of trade, technical co-operation and a level of political dialogue which recognises both Iran's role and its influence in the region.  I met the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament here last year and other Members, perhaps even members of this committee, have engaged on a bilateral basis.  I must acknowledge there are difficulties in the area of human rights and with regard to Iran's involvement in and association with a number of conflicts and tension points in the region, which must also be borne in mind.  I will be happy to keep the committee informed.  It is my belief that we should continue along the path of dialogue to ensure that we can have an improved relationship across a range of pursuits.  I am a great believer in dialogue across a range of issues.  That also plugs into the St. Patrick's Day event.  People should avail of opportunities to speak at all levels.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy O'Brien's contribution on the Middle East peace process, I visited the region twice, officially, in recent years.  I have discussed the Middle East peace process with both local leaders, EU colleagues, senior persons at the highest level in the Palestinian Administration and directly with Prime Minister Netanyahu last year in Jerusalem, along with former defence Minister and current Minister Lieberman and others.  I acknowledge what the programme for Government states and the commitment on the part of the Government to ensure the viability of a two-state solution in an area of great challenge, which has been the case for many years.  I am committed to continuing to acknowledge the importance of the two-state solution.  I keep under continuous review whether an immediate recognition by Ireland of a state of Palestine, prior to its real achievement on the ground, is helpful towards the goal of finding a lasting resolution to this conflict.  It is not a matter of making up my mind.  It is not a matter of me being unwilling.  Neither is it a matter of the Government being unwilling but it is a matter of ensuring that we make what will be a lasting contribution.

I acknowledge UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which states clearly that the settlements are illegal and that they actively undermine the prospects for a sustainable negotiated two-state solution.  I have said that on numerous occasions and I have conveyed the message to the Israelis.  In fact, the most recent announcements proposing more than 3,000 units are deeply disappointing because to my mind those actions and ongoing activities serve only to undermine the reputation of Israel and the credibility of declarations on the part of its Government towards support for a negotiated peaceful solution.  I call again at this committee this morning for an end to all settlement construction and a reversal of current announcements.  Yes, I have made my position and that of the Government perfectly clear, directly to the Israelis.  I want the Government's position to form a very positive part of moving towards a solution.  I was very pleased to represent the Government at two internationally convened peace conferences in Paris last year and again in January of this year.  It is important that international engagement is also acknowledged in the context of any unilateral action that may be considered on the part of this country.

The Department's work under programme D, which was previously programme C, will focus on leveraging our resources to drive job creation, our exports including cultural exports, inward investment, tourism and education.  There will be a particular focus in 2017 on assisting Irish business in the context of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  My Department&rsquo;s commitment to advancing Ireland&rsquo;s trade and economic interests in Europe and internationally is set out.  The current amount allocated is &euro;31.2 million, representing an increase of &euro;3 million on 2016, mainly due to the consolidation of existing promotion and outreach funding from a range of programmes.<\/p> <p>  We play a crucial role in efforts to restore our international reputation and to promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests overseas.  Our economy is in good shape and continuing to grow strongly.  Key indicators on employment, GDP and debt levels continue to move steadily in a positive direction.<\/p> <p>  Members will be familiar with the work of our embassies abroad through trade missions and visits.  The networking they do and their engagement with the local community at all levels, as members of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, is an essential platform for our bilateral relations and for the work of the State agencies.  I wish to acknowledge the work of this committee in that regard.  It is helpful to me in my work and is also helpful to the Government.  The work projects, in terms of Irish values, expand our influence, secure our place in Europe, support our people abroad, and foster our continued prosperity.  These remain our high level goals.  I believe it is important that we engage at the highest level.  <\/p> <p>  We look at our pre-existing market funds in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, designed to support larger initiatives and projects and spanning a number of countries and of course, in the context of Brexit, the need to ensure a greater level of market diversification and intensification.  That is a core focus for team Ireland overseas.  Our export trade council meets regularly, we have expanded further now in the context of the challenge of the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.  We also have the full and active participation of the Minister for Education and Skills and his officials with particular reference to international education and the drive to capture a greater share of that market. <\/p> <p>  Our trade division funds a range of activities associated with joint economic commissions with four countries: China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Korea.

The Vote provides the funding necessary to deliver on the Department's high level goal to work towards a fairer, more just, secure and sustainable world.  This year the Government has provided &euro;651 million in official development assistance, an increase of &euro;10 million on last year's allocation.  The increase builds on the momentum started in 2016 in increasing budget allocations for official development assistance in a measured and sustainable way.  It also represents a clear demonstration of the Government's firm commitment to the aid programme.  In the past year we have consistently reaffirmed our commitment to making progress towards achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of gross national product, GNP, as official development assistance.  The programme for Government makes our position clear that we will make progress towards the target as resources permit.  As economic recovery consolidates, we have begun to increase ODA allocations and hope to continue to deliver on this commitment into the future.  Our ambition is to continue to make sustainable progress towards the UN target in line with the commitment we have made with our fellow EU member states to collectively reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2030.  I recognise the challenge the target presents and look forward to engaging with the committee on our common commitment to achieving it.<\/p> <p>  Over 80% of Irish Aid's funding is provided in sub-Saharan Africa where needs are greatest.  The priority we attach to Africa is also a wider European one, given the increasing connections and the common pressures facing the two continents.  In July I visited Uganda and in December, Kenya.  I saw how Ireland's aid programme was sharply focused on helping vulnerable people in the poorest regions from Karamoja to Adjumani in northern Uganda to Samburu County in northern Kenya.  I also had the privilege of visiting several inspiring projects run by Irish missionary organisations in Kenya, as well as meeting Irish missionaries who have made such a remarkable contribution to Africa and developing an empathy with it among the Irish people.  I also saw how our embassies integrated their work across all areas, from building trade to political, cultural and people-to-people links between Ireland and Africa.<\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware of the daunting, unprecedented scale of humanitarian need globally.  Over 128 million people in 33 countries around the world are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, with 65 million displaced from their homes.  The United Nations requires $22.2 billion in 2017 to reach the most vulnerable, five times the amount required a decade ago.  The humanitarian crises we face are the result of natural disaster, climate change, drought, wars and conflict.  The conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Yemen will remain among the greatest drivers of prolonged humanitarian needs in 2017.  I will travel to Lebanon and Jordan in the coming weeks to assess the impact and the humanitarian response.  The officials in the Department will be more than happy to facilitate a visit by the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#N00700","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":682,"content":"<p>Will the Minister of State visit the refugee camps in Lebanon?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#N00800","speaker":"1313"},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":683,"content":"<p>Yes; that is why we are going there.

My understanding is that spend on overseas development aid this year will be 0.3% of GNP, which is the lowest spend in this area for 17 years.  We all know that the Government and every Department is facing huge challenges, but as a country we need to progress our achievement of the 0.7% goal to which we have been committed for some time.  The sustainable development goals, in which Ireland, through the Minister of State, and his colleague, Mr. David Donoghue, played a huge part in achieving, are dependent on countries increasing their commitment to overseas development aid.<\/p><p> In regard to Brexit, will the EU development budget be impacted by Britain leaving the EU?  We all have difficulties with Britain on many issues, but under successive Governments over the past decade or so it has managed to ramp up its contribution to overseas development aid.  Whatever its contribution directly to the EU budget, there will be a loss following Brexit.  We all complain, and rightly so, about the EU and its structures and governance, but it is the main donor in terms of overseas development aid in response to humanitarian crises.  It is important to recognise that.  At a time when there are, unfortunately, more crises and humanitarian need throughout the world, as a country Ireland needs to do better.  The Minister of State will probably respond to the effect that there has been a change in the measurement of our GNP.  Whether or not that is true I do not know, but we should be improving incrementally towards achieving the 0.7% of GNP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#N01000","speaker":"1270","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":686,"content":"<p>Following on from the Chairman's point in regard to current spend being 0.3% of GNP, perhaps the Minister of State would confirm if that is the official outturn figure for last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#O00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":687,"content":"<p>Sorry, Deputy, I was referring to the projected figure for 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#O00300","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":688,"content":"<p>Okay.  Does the Minister of State have the final figure for 2016?  There has been only a &euro;10 million increase, although I acknowledge that, in fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, he will be fighting for additional provision.  I recognise the work of Irish Aid, Mr. Gaffey and his team.  It is superb, there is no question about that, but it needs to be further resourced.  During our first meeting last year I raised the issue of multiannual planning, which I accept will require the agreement of all parties and groups.  I am aware of the difficulties which the Minister of State will face in terms of going to Government and asking for a significant increase for overseas development aid at a time when other Ministers are seeking funds for other projects, but while the current provision is significant, we are going backwards.  There is no point in restating a goal that we are never going to achieve.  In a previous report to the committee by, I think, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, we were told that we were expected to achieve the 0.7% target by 2030.  Is that the official Government line now?  We need to give serious consideration to what is achievable over a five year timeframe and to put that money in place.  The Minister of State needs to put that up to other parties, including Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  Following on from the spring statement, the Committee on Budgetary Oversight is the starting point for the budgetary process.  A &euro;10 million per annum increase is not enough.  If we continue with that, we will end up sliding backwards such that we might as well forget about ever achieving the 0.7% target.  I am not laying responsibility for this at the door of the Minister of State because it is the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister of State and the Government.  It is about time all parties and groups were asked what they propose to do in monetary terms.  I proposed that last year.  Fianna F&aacute;il is open to working with Government in this regard and we want other parties and groups to do likewise.  The tough choice will have to be made.  We need to see a significant increase in this budget.  I recognise the work of D&oacute;chas and other NGOs in this sector in working with Irish Aid.  Fianna F&aacute;il has done work on this issue.  We estimate that to get to 0.4% over a four year period, a &euro;60 million to &euro;70 million allocation will be required next year, but that is unlikely to happen.  We need either to forget about the target and be realistic - which I do not want us to do - or take serious steps to achieve it.<\/p> <p>  The work being done with our partner countries is great.  Is consideration being given to our partnering with other countries' aid programmes?  I a believer in untied aid.  The British model is slightly different from that.  Some countries will use aid for trade.  I do not think we should do that but we can use Irish Aid to partner with countries that, perhaps, diplomatically we have work to do but with which we do not have the necessary business ties.  There are countries that do a lot of work in Africa, including Israel.  The Minister of State might be surprised to hear me mention that but I genuinely believe Irish Aid is a really good vehicle through which we can improve our relations with other countries or get to know other countries better.  Is any such work under consideration?  I again commend the work that Irish Aid is doing.  I would like to see us support it more and to see us make greater progress in achieving the 0.7% target.  That is not happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#O00400","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his presentation.  Were any organisations or projects suspended owing to fraud or because they were not being run properly?

How does the Department police the spend of funding on projects?  How does it ensure money is spent in the areas for which it is provided?<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the Minister of State's comments in regard to the Irish missionaries abroad.  I recall speaking at a function a few years ago in Lusaka at which there were a number of missionaries in attendance.  As I said on that occasion, the missionaries are the true ambassadors for Ireland abroad.  They are the people who make the Irish feel welcome and wanted.  When I visited the Parliament in Lusaka, I met 14 members of Parliament who were taught by Irish missionaries, which is phenomenal.  It is because of the work of the Irish missionaries down through the years that Ireland is held in such high esteem abroad and St. Patrick's Day is celebrated in so many countries around the world.  We are, unfortunately, running out of missionaries to send abroad.  However, as I said, those we have are doing tremendous work on the ground.  I once met a nun who was 74 years old and had left Donegal at 17 years of age.  Her order wanted to bring her home to retire but she did not want to come home.  She said that she had lived all of her life in Lusaka and she did not want to go back to wet and windy Ireland.  Perhaps the order should take that on board and should stop forcing people home to come home and spend the remainder of their lives in Ireland where all too often the weather is miserable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#O00500","speaker":"1313"},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":690,"content":"<p>The only way we can work towards achieving the 0.7% target is collectively.  I am on record already in that regard.  In regard to the sustainable development goals and the 2030 plan I do not think it is good enough to say that in 14 years we will achieve the 0.7% target.  If we want to hit that target we need to put in place a mechanism to do so and the only way we can do that is working collectively.<\/p><p>Since 2011 to date, the total development package which Irish taxpayers have contributed is &euro;4.5 billion.  When I indicate that at various events, people are surprised to hear it.  It is reflective of where people are at in terms of what they want to do and their contribution to the global challenges.  In a survey undertaken by the UN before Christmas, Ireland was ranked ninth in the world in terms of <i>per capita<\/i>contribution.<\/p><p>In fact, we are ahead of the United States because, while the United States signs the biggest cheque for development globally, we are ahead of them <i>per capita<\/i>.  I do not, however, accept that we should be at 0.3%.  We could do more but we have come through an economic period which left us faced with certain choices.  In 2011, 2012 and 2013, very harsh measures were taken on respite care, people with disabilities etc. but the ODA budget stayed the same.  The Irish taxpayers need to be acknowledged for that.  I am happy to work with the committee on this.<br\/><br\/>Deputy O'Brien asked where we were in terms of opportunities to partner with other countries.  We are in consultation with fellow EU members and are looking for joined-up programming opportunities and these will happen.  I acknowledge the work that David Donoghue and his team have done.  They have built up their reputation for work in Kenya and Jordan over decades.  Missionary work down the years also allows us to open doors.  I met missionaries to Africa in Limerick at the beginning of the year and they used the word &quot;authenticity&quot;.  We have authenticity in our reputation at the moment.  The Department of Finance in Kampala in Uganda asked us to get more involved in business.  Many of them were educated by Irish priests and nuns and they see our honesty and integrity.  It is not about using that as a platform and as an opportunity for business but it is about business connections helping in a wider sense in areas such as sustainability.<br\/><br\/>I had a wonderful opportunity to meet Sr. Mary Owens in Nairobi, Kenya.  She started off as a principal in my alma mater in Milford in 1966 and was three years there before going to Africa, where she has been since.  She is working with young children and teenagers on a HIV programme.  A laboratory has been built with financing from Irish Aid.  It is a wonderful project and such investments in humanity by Irish people should never be forgotten.  They have ploughed the furrow for the rest of us.<br\/><br\/>A question was also asked on evaluation auditing and the money that goes to different groups.  We have a very strict and accountable system for funds, which amounted to &euro;651 million this year.  There is a very good system of governance which is evolving all the time to adapt to different challenges.  It is a requirement of all grant agreements that partners in receipt of Irish Aid funding, with the exception of international organisations, provide annual audited accounts.  Audit coverage is close to 100%, though there may be exemptions for very small grants.  The number of partners and grants, both at headquarters and in partner countries, will vary each year, as will the number of audit reports received annually.  A reasonable estimate would be more than 200 reports each year.  Audit requirements for international organisations, such as UN bodies, are laid down in international agreements.  The Department usually receives audited financial statements from these bodies.  In addition, with regard to UN bodies, the Department receives reports on internal audit activity presented to the executive boards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017021600002#O00600","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487237400,"counter":692,"content":"<p>I concur with the comments of Deputies Darragh O'Brien and Noel Grealish on the contribution of Irish religious and lay missionaries.  Over the years the different Irish NGOs have made presentations to us and the people at the coalface are working in the most difficult circumstances to deliver services.  We owe them a great debt of gratitude for the work they do, helping the most deprived people in the world.  We will never give enough in ODA and Deputy O'Brien's suggestion for an all-party approach at budgetary level could help the Minister for Foreign Affairs to get a better allocation from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Whether in good times or bad times, there are always pressures on the budget for every Department and maybe an all-party approach, through the Select Committee on Budgetary Oversight, would be a good way to get unanimous agreement.  We need to do more for the most deprived people and that does not take away from the huge challenges facing many people in our country.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Grealish has often spoken of the huge contribution of our missionaries over the years.  The Holy Rosary Sisters are neighbours of mine in Cavan town.  They are all retired people who have come back from Africa, nuns who gave their lives to teaching, nursing and working as doctors and consultants.

The committee has a copy of my statement, which covers Votes 1 - 6, inclusive: President&rsquo;s Establishment; Department of the Taoiseach; Office of the Attorney General; Central Statistics Office; Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions; and Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  The net Estimates for 2017 are as follows: the President&rsquo;s Establishment - &euro;3.9 million; Department of the Taoiseach - &euro;36.75 million; Office of the Attorney General - &euro;14.9 million; Central Statistics Office - &euro;48.58 million; Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions - &euro;40.68 million; Office of the Chief State Solicitor - &euro;32.34 million.<\/p> <p>  The committee had a detailed briefing last week on Votes 1 - 6.  I will now outline briefly the proposed 2017 Estimate for the Department, I will highlight some work that was carried out in 2016 and I will detail some of the Estimates for the 2017 President's Establishment, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  While I have certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas in respect of administrative matters in these Offices, they operate independently of my Department.  Minister of State, Deputy Regina Doherty, Government Chief Whip, will outline the 2017 Revised Estimate allocation for the Central Statistics Office and will take any questions relevant to that Vote.<\/p> <p>  I am joined today by the following officials from my Department: Ms Elizabeth Canavan, Ms Geraldine Butler and Ms Amanda Reilly of the finance unit in the Department of the Taoiseach.  At the outset it is important to acknowledge a member of my staff.  The Chairman himself probably knew Lorcan Fullam.  He was the former Irish ambassador to Zimbabwe and returned to Ireland to work at the Department of the Taoiseach.  At 49 years of age he was a married man with three young children.  He is being buried as we speak.  He is a great loss to this Department and many of the officials are very upset.  I spoke with Lorcan just five or six weeks ago.  He had cancer and was unable to come out from it.  I apologise for the absence of the Secretary General of the Department at today's meeting who, along with a number of others, were all anxious to attend his funeral which is happening as we sit here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017021600002#B00100","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1487243400,"counter":709,"content":"<p>We join with the Taoiseach in offering our sympathies to the family.

It includes &euro;2.6 million for pay and administration, with the balance to fund the payment of a bounty to centenarians Bounty.  It is estimated that approximately 430 centenarians will receive the bounty in 2017.<\/p> <p>  Vote 2 Revised Estimate for my own Department is &euro;36.7 million.  This includes &euro;17.9 million for administration costs.  The primary role of the Department of the Taoiseach is to support me in my executive functions as Taoiseach, to support the Government, and to oversee implementation of the programme for Government.  A number of Ministers of State are assigned to the Department: the Government Chief Whip; the Minister of State for European Affairs with responsibility for EU digital market and data protection; the Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs; and the Minister of State with responsibility for defence.<\/p> <p>  An important part of my Department&rsquo;s work is providing a secretariat for meetings of the Government and of Cabinet committees, each of which I chair.  The committees are on infrastructure, environment and climate action;  the economy, trade and jobs; housing; social policy and public service reform; health; justice reform; arts, Irish, the Gaeltacht and the islands; regional and rural affairs; European affairs; and most recently the Brexit committee, which is  a cross-Government committee.<\/p> <p>  Committee members have received a detailed brief covering the 2016 outputs and expenditure for each area of my Department in 2016, as well as details of the 2017 Estimate provision.  I wish to comment on the 2016 commemoration events.  My Department was responsible for co-ordinating the 2016 centenary State commemoration programme, which was a cross-Government initiative to stimulate debate and discussion about 1916; and to ensure a strong, varied and respectful programme of events throughout the year across Ireland, North and South, and globally in America, Britain and other places, to mark the centenary of 1916.  The Department also took the lead in the organisation of a number of State ceremonies, including the 1 January 2016 flag-raising ceremony.  It was an appalling day weather wise at Dublin Castle and it is why I remember it so well.<\/p> <p>  The State ceremonies also included the Easter Sunday wreath laying ceremony in Kilmainham Gaol, which was extraordinarily emotional.  The ceremonies also included the Easter Sunday ceremony at GPO and the parade; the Easter Sunday State reception in Dublin Castle; the inter-faith ceremony at Glasnevin Cemetery remembrance wall; and the 100th anniversary of the battle of the Somme.  The success of the commemoration programme was the culmination of many months of hard work and careful planning across a range of offices, Departments and State agencies.  The staff of my Department are very proud that they played a central part in the organisation of these events, and in ensuring that they reflected the inclusive and respectful tone which the Government set out to achieve as non-partisan, broad, comprehensive and inclusive as possible.  I saw the pride in people's faces at first-hand when I presented those involved in the commemoration programme with the civil service excellence in innovation awards at the end of 2016.  This award was very much deserved.<\/p> <p>  Looking ahead to the decade of centenaries programme in which my Department&rsquo;s involvement is ongoing, this programme seeks to be a measured and reflective way to commemorate significant events that shaped the history of the island of Ireland, events which led to more sensitive and difficult positions arising from the War of Independence, to the Civil War and up to the 1920s.  In addition, my Department - through the vehicle of the Cabinet committee on arts, Irish, Gaeltacht and the islands - will oversee the implementation of a new programme called Creative Ireland.  This is a five year initiative, from 2017 to 2022, building up to the centenary of the establishment of the Free State, which places creativity at the centre of public policy.  For the centenary celebrations every community around the State, irrespective of where they were - children, secondary school children, young adults or older people - all came together in different programmes be it around plays, poems and stories about the Proclamation, the Constitution and connections with 1916 through family.  This was evidence that there was a great deal of creativity and imaginative value among all those who were involved.  The Government now wants to place that at the centre of public policy.  This is why the Creative Ireland programme is being brought about.  It is a high level, high definition, whole-of-Government initiative designed to mainstream creativity in the life of the nation so that individually and collectively, in our personal lives and in our institutions, we can realise that full creative potential, which is extraordinary.  In America, Britain, Europe and Australia they value the difference that Ireland brings when they add in this element.<\/p> <p>  My Department also wants to ensure implementation of programmes in health, education and other public services as outlined in the programme for Government in 2017 and beyond.  We will look to ensure that the position of vulnerable groups in society is taken into account as the economic recovery continues, that the benefits of recovery and progress are felt across all sectors of society, and that there is an effective cross-Government response to the Departments where this applies.  There will be a focus on providing a safe and supportive environment for children, families and older people, including through reforms in the areas of housing, social services and the justice system.<\/p> <p>  Addressing the housing challenge is a big priority for Government.  Our Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, published in July, sets out 84 time-bound actions.  This is to shift the emphasis to deal with homelessness, people who sleep rough, voided units, locked up buildings, the provision of social housing and private housing with a major programme in the commercial end also.<\/p><p> We are committed to delivering increased supply of affordable, quality and accessible housing, increasing housing construction to 25,000 new homes per year by 2020 and addressing the homelessness crisis.  We have committed more than &euro;5 billion to deliver 47,000 social housing units and &euro;200 million for a local infrastructure fund to unlock private development.  This applies where sites cannot be accessed because a new bridge, road or similar changes are needed.  In addition, a strategy for the rental sector was published in December.  While the plan is overseen by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, implementation is a whole-of-Government effort overseen through regular meetings of the Cabinet committee on housing, which met 13 or 14 times last year. <\/p><p> I also chair a ministerial task force to support the long-term economic and social regeneration of the north inner city of Dublin.  I asked Mr. Kieran Mulvey to engage with local community groups and representatives and prepare a report with specific recommendations to support the area's regeneration.  I will launch the report later today.  Multiple gangland murders have taken place in the north inner city, an area I have visited many times.  Neighbourhoods that have been neglected and forgotten will be brought back into the mainstream.  Many communities have been doing extraordinary work but this work needs to be co-ordinated and some major developments must be followed through, including Rutland Street school and Fitzgibbon Street Garda Station.  A number of other facilities will also be brought back into regular use. <\/p><p> My Department works with the interdepartmental agency group to co-ordinate the input of the two Governments on the island in the bid to secure the hosting in Ireland of the Rugby World Cup in 2023.  This has required an extraordinary if costly effort, although moneys spent will be recouped through ticket sales if we win the right to host the tournament.  I visited P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh the other day where work is under way and will be completed by mid-June.  The new stadium, which will have 50,000 seats, will be ready in mid-July and available for the Rugby World Cup.<\/p><p> The underlying economy grew strongly in 2016, with growth in consumption, strong tax receipts and labour market developments all confirming robust and broad based growth.  Importantly, unemployment has fallen to 7.1%.  While growth of more than 3% is expected in 2017, as the Government is aware, the external environment remains particularly uncertain owing to Brexit and other factors.  Yesterday, I announced 500 jobs in Dublin with a multinational company and a further 500 jobs will be announced tomorrow.  The line of investment into the country is strong.  <\/p><p> There are more than 2 million people at work, which reflects the focus the Government has maintained on the need to create and sustain jobs across sectors and in every region.  Notwithstanding perceptions, all regions have experienced economic growth.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, has issued a direction that 135,000 of the 200,000 jobs to be created by 2020 are to be in the regions. <\/p><p> We launched the Action Plan for Jobs for 2017 on 1 February.  The action plan identifies 164 specific actions to be delivered in 2017, with a target of an additional 45,000 jobs this year.  My Department will continue to play a central role in overseeing its implementation to ensure commitments are delivered on time and in full.  We publish updates on a quarterly basis and our track record in this regard has been good, with more than 90% of promised measures delivered in 2016.<\/p><p> My Department also supports me in a strategic programme of international engagement, with a focus on driving job creation, sustainable economic development, trade, tourism and investment.  I will travel to Washington in March for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations to continue to protect and promote the strong links between the Irish and American peoples.  This is symbolic of the contribution Irish people made to America for one and a half centuries.  We want to build on our links with America and speak directly to the US President on a number of issues, especially the issue of the estimated 50,000 undocumented Irish people living in the United States.  I will raise these issues with the US President when I have an opportunity to do so. <\/p><p> This year will also be an opportunity to apprise the new US Administration and Congress of issues of Irish interest, including immigration reform and the Northern Ireland peace process, and reaffirm our long-standing relationship based on shared values of democracy and the rule of law, as well as economic and historical ties.  Many members of the new Administration have Irish connections and I would like to explain to them our tradition and particular circumstances. <\/p><p> Brexit is also a major issue.  As Britain prepares to leave the European Union, we face the most complicated and difficult negotiations we have had since 1939.  The Government has been preparing hard for the issue.  The 2014 national risk assessment co-ordinated by my Department was one of the first publications to publicly identify Brexit as a strategic risk to Ireland, a fact picked up in international media coverage at the time.  In 2015, a dedicated unit was established in my Department to consider issues arising for Ireland in the context of the referendum and to develop contingency plans.  Important changes were also implemented in other Departments and agencies, with additional resources provided in key areas.  Since the referendum result, intensified analysis and option planning has been carried out across a number of areas and extensive stakeholder consultation is ongoing at sectoral and all-island level.  The second all-island civic forum will take place tomorrow and on Friday.  These engagements have been worthwhile.  With an election campaign taking place in Northern Ireland, there is no Executive in place and many sectors, including transport, logistics, agriculture and hospitality, are all very pleased to be able to take part in the sectoral discussions and express their views on how Brexit will impact on them.<\/p><p> We established a Cabinet committee, which I chair, to oversee the overall Government response to Brexit, including both the economic impact and the negotiations at EU level and with the Administrations in London and Belfast.  I have also restructured divisions in my Department to ensure Brexit is treated as a crucial cross-cutting issue.  Some issues are incredibly difficult and the agriculture sector is of primary importance to us.  I met fishermen the other evening and the Common Fisheries Policy is exceptionally complex.  One cannot remove one section and expect to trade it, just like that, for another.  If Britain were to leave the EU in a hard Brexit, we would face a very difficult scenario in terms of fishing quotas and opportunities.<\/p><p> The Department created a newly amalgamated international, EU and Northern Ireland division under a new second Secretary General.  The work of this division includes supporting the Cabinet committees on Brexit and European affairs.  Work on Brexit is also supported by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, whose Department has a greater role in EU matters, with a newly created EU division and the existing division dealing with Anglo-Irish affairs both having important roles to play.<\/p><p> Across government, relevant Departments and agencies are working on Brexit and a number of them have been strengthened to deal with the issue.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have received additional staff and trade elements have been provided for diplomatic services.  Last week, for instance, I opened a Bord Bia office in Warsaw to complement the work of the ambassador and Enterprise Ireland.  We have many opportunities to secure further expansion for Irish food businesses in the eurozone and in other EU countries.  <\/p><p> The Government is very aware of the potential economic opportunities that may arise for Ireland, including in terms of mobile investment.  Significant interest has been expressed from firms in London which are considering Ireland and a number of other locations as possible locations for a move.  Many of these companies will not wait for Brexit negotiations to conclude before making a decision to move to a different location.<\/p><p> We also have a great interest in attracting the European Medicines Board and European Banking Authority to relocate here.  The former is responsible for bringing approximately 50,000 bed nights per annum to London.  Ireland ticks a number of boxes and would be a credible location for both agencies.  However, we are competing with ten or 12 countries to attract them.  Given that Ireland is an English speaking country in the Single Market with connectivity to London which offers a similar environment to other countries, we have a good opportunity.  Approval has been given for the international school for Baccalaureate achievement, which is of importance to people from abroad who live and work here and have children.<\/p><p> We are under no illusion in respect of Brexit.  The critical negotiation priorities have been identified and the programme of dialogue will continue intensively and vigilance and engagement on economic risks and challenges will be maintained.<\/p><p>Economic opportunities for this country will be pursued vigorously.  Engagement with other member states and EU institutions will intensify.  Ireland will negotiate from a position of strength, as one of the 27 members firmly in and committed to remaining in the European Union, and we will participate fully in the discussions on the future direction of the European Union.  This started at the discussion in Malta.  There was a discussion among the 27 on the future of Europe, the digital market, digital single market, and other programmes that are laid out by the President's report up to 2023.<\/p><p> The programme for Government commitments contain new and important challenges for my Department, like the digital single market, the establishment of the independent Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, and Seanad reform.  A small programme for Government office within my Department monitors the implementation of the programme and as these things are achieved by different Departments, they outline or list them off.  The programme sets out a new approach, not only including the partners of Government, but inclusive of the Oireachtas and wider society.  Part of this approach includes reform of how the D&aacute;il sets and conducts its business, reform of the budgetary process, and development of a broad based consensus in addressing key longer-term challenges.<\/p><p> The relationship between the Oireachtas and the Government means an enhanced role for the Office of the Chief Whip within my Department.  That office works closely with a new parliamentary liaison unit which works to ensure that Ministers and Departments are properly informed of new responsibilities and procedures in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  I have outlined for the committee some of the key outputs of my Department in 2016 and some of the priorities we are working to make progress on in 2017 and beyond.  In all areas, the Department looks for value for money and to maximise efficiencies, adhering to best practice in terms of procurement.<\/p><p> Vote 3 for the Office of the Attorney General is &euro;14.9 million for 2017.  The majority of the administrative expenditure relates to staff salaries which will cost over &euro;11 million in 2017.  The next largest expenditure is the grant of just over &euro;2.2 million for the Law Reform Commission, which does great work.<\/p><p> Vote 5 is for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The &euro;40.68 million for 2017 represents an increase of 5%, or &euro;1.79 million, over the 2016 estimates.  Just over &euro;1 million of this is due to increases in pay and fees to counsel, with provision for additional staff to cover extra sittings of the Central Criminal Court.  The balance of the increased provision is to cover general law expenses.<\/p><p> Vote 6 is for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  It is &euro;32.3 million for 2017.  Salaries, wages and allowances account for &euro;16.76 million out of a total budget of just over &euro;19 million.  The remaining &euro;2.3 million is attributable to the general running costs of the office.  A provision of &euro;14.6 million is allocated for the payment of legal fees including &euro;13 million for counsel fees and &euro;1.4 million for general law expenses.  These include items like expert witnesses and stenographers.<\/p><p> That is a general run-down of where we are.  Members may have some questions that they want to ask.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017021600002#B00300","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487243400,"counter":713,"content":"<p>On subheads A4 and A5, the cost of tribunals of inquiry and the commissions of investigation, I see the 2017 Revised Estimate is &euro;10 million for tribunals, and a commission of investigation is &euro;4.7 million.

The Moriarty tribunal into certain payments to politicians and related matters, established in 1997, concluded at a cost of &euro;54.742 million.  The Smithwick inquiry was a tribunal of inquiry established in 2006.  That was to deal with the fatal shooting of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Robert Buchanan of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in 1989.  That concluded at a cost of &euro;19.4 million.  The tribunal inquiry in the Lindsay case, covering hepatitis C and HIV, concluded at &euro;46.677 million.  The Finlay tribunal of inquiry into the blood transfusion board of 1997 concluded at &euro;4.38 million.

A breakdown of expenditure between legal fees, administrative costs and third-party costs is as follows.  Legal fees are &euro;35.58 million, administration is &euro;9.764 million, third-party costs are &euro;6.848 million and other legal payments are &euro;2.55 million.  The tribunal is currently dealing with applications for third-party costs.  The sole member has indicated that the majority of applications for third-party costs have now been considered by him and there remain only a very limited number of applications which are still being considered.  The tribunal determines only entitlements to costs, not the costs themselves.  These are usually settled in negotiation, or failing agreement, by the Taxing-Master.  To the end of 2016, 60 bills of costs amounting of &euro;14.312 million were settled, for a total of &euro;6.848 million and settlements in excess of &euro;20,000 are published on the Department's website on a periodic basis.  A legal cost agent in the State Claims Agency deals with third-party bills of cost from the tribunal of inquiry.  Prior to its establishment, claims were handled by the Chief State Solicitor's office, which engaged professional legal accountants to examine them.  It is on top of the payments already made, and it is 20 years old.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017021600002#D01300","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1487243400,"counter":725,"content":"<p>Is the tribunal being proposed a sole member again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017021600002#D01400","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1487243400,"counter":726,"content":"<p>Yes, Mr. Justice Peter Charleton of the Supreme Court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017021600002#D01500","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1487243400,"counter":727,"content":"<p>When someone like that is taken from the Supreme Court, what happens next?

It appears from our engagement with the banks that the numbers of repossessions will dramatically increase in 2017, which is an issue which concerns us all.  I put forward a suggestion to the Minister about a friendly vulture fund or an agency that would be the preferred agency to purchase these debts from the bank at the same rate that a vulture fund might do.  This would allow people to stay in their homes, allow them to pay their own rent or have a mortgage arrangement.  That would solve that problem.  Can the Government take an initiative in that area to try to curb those repossessions and keep people in their homes and have an agency of the State involved, perhaps funded by Government bonds in a similar way to NAMA, except on a far smaller scale?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017021600002#E00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1487243400,"counter":731,"content":"<p>I have met a number of county registrars who have been dealing with these matters.  Given the scale and the range of mortgages which have been in distress for quite some time, we are getting to the point where a judge is going to or is not going to make a recommendation for repossession.  Many repossessions have been voluntary.  The Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, organisation has brought an element of compassion and understanding into this.  I take the point the Chairman is making.<\/p> <p>  The point which was made to me, which I have communicated to the Department of Finance, is that if houses can be bought at market value by a friendly fund, by Government or whatever, such that they could be leased to the tenants over a longer period with a seamless transfer to them, it means nobody is put out of his or her house but there is a change of the method by which such people will be able to retain ownership in the time ahead.  That is replicated in the revamping of the mortgage-to-rent scheme that the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, has now brought in.  The revisions to the scheme, which followed a very extensive review, constitute a series of actions to make mortgage to rent quicker, more transparent, easier to navigate for borrowers and ultimately more accessible to more households in mortgage distress.  Those changes will dramatically increase the numbers of householders availing of the scheme to deal with the very point the Chairman raised.  This has come through at the Cabinet sub-committee on a number of occasions.  It is very distressing for families where the family home is under pressure for one reason or another.  At the extreme end of mortgage arrears, where households may be facing the trauma of losing their homes, these changes are now being included as a solution to that to take that trauma and distress away.<\/p> <p>  The recent bank statistics show that the level of arrears is declining.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has pointed out that there remain a significant number of borrowers in long-term mortgage distress who have no prospect of a significant change in their circumstances in the foreseeable future.  The mortgage-to-rent scheme has not had the capacity so far to deliver significant volumes of transactions.  Only 217 have been completed to date, with a further 635 reaching conclusion.  New property valuation procedures and a new communications protocol are going to be put in place now and implemented to cover communications between borrowers and lenders at all stages of the mortgage-to-rent process.<\/p> <p>  The process for repairs to properties will be revised to speed that up.  How delays arising at conveyancing stage on the legal end might be addressed will be explored at a forum which is going to be attended by the approved housing bodies before the end of quarter one of this year.  A key objective of the actions will be a reduction in the average length of time for the completion of a transaction from between 12 and 18 months to less than nine.<\/p> <p>  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 was enacted in July of 2015 to ensure consumer protection where loans are sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a credit servicing firm.  Credit servicing firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to regulated financial service providers.<\/p> <p>  Increasing the viability and familiarity of the scheme among borrowers is a critical objective.  Once word gets out that this is an opportunity not to lose one's home but to get into a position where the home can be leased over a period with an option to buy would attract support from family members.  The new Abhaile service and MABS will be important contributors to this.  This new national mortgage arrears resolution service was launched back in October.  It helps at risk home owners in mortgage arrears by providing access to expert financial and legal advice free of charge.  Clients can get assistance in court if needed, have access to solicitors and get help obtaining legal advice.  They can also get financial advice from a dedicated mortgage arrears adviser, a personal insolvency practitioner or an accountant, so it is hoped that might improve the position for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017021600002#E00300","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1487243400,"counter":732,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach heads up many trade missions.

For example, when I was in Warsaw to meet the Polish Prime Minister we opened the new Bord Bia office.  It is a great thing to have them all working together in the one unit, so that anything to do with Ireland is going on through the diplomatic services, through Enterprise Ireland, the IDA or Bord Bia.  Every Minister going abroad this year for St. Patrick's Day will have a trade mission element around what they do.  Whether it be far or near, there will be a set programme that will be approved by Government before they go so that everyone knows that they are doing the brand work for Ireland as well.<\/p> <p>  I remember dealing with Connect Ireland just after I was appointed Taoiseach.  I believe in that project.  It might have been incorrectly structured at the beginning with the IDA, and I know that there were some pressures and differences of opinion as to how that happened.  However, every job is a job, and when we had no jobs, to count them in fives and tens was very important.

It has been reasonably successful and resulted in industry moving to places where one would not expect it to locate.  It involves members of the Irish diaspora who think the company in which they are employed might be shifting some resources to Europe and they ask the company to consider locating in Ireland.

I am sure he is well aware of the contents of that Bill.  Has he, his Department or the Cabinet, but more so he and his Department, considered introducing the cost-saving elements of that legislation in the form of emergency legislation given that we are about to establish a tribunal of inquiry?  The Taoiseach mentioned to the chairperson, and rightly so, that anybody appearing before a tribunal is entitled to full legal representation.  The Tribunals of Inquiry Bill, which was introduced on foot of a Law Reform Commission report, following on from a recommendation in the Moriarty tribunal, made it clear that the judge would indicate to each witness the level of legal representation that would be paid by the State.  It would be up to the individual whether they wanted to beef that up at their own cost.  It also allowed for the Minister to set regulations that would limit the amount that could be paid to members of the legal profession on an hourly rate.  The crazy scenario is that some of the costs in the Estimates, with which we are dealing, have been paid out to public relations consultants as witnesses tramped into different tribunals of investigation.  Public relations consultants who were working to spin a line to the media and to the public were able to recoup their costs fully from the State as a result of that.  The 2005 legislation would have prevented that from happening.  It requires the sole member, or those presiding over a tribunal of investigation, after 30 days of its establishment and within 60 days of it, to give an indication of the costs associated with the tribunal.  The sole member would be in a position to do so because he would know the witnesses who were coming forward, the legal representation costs that the State is willing to pay and he would have been aware of the regulations the Minister would introduce to impose a limit on the amount to be paid.<\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach spoke to the chairperson about the costs involved in the tribunal of inquiry into payments to politicians, which were more than &euro;100 million, and in the Moriarty tribunal, which were more than &euro;54 million with another &euro;10 million to be paid out.  I understand the urgency in making sure that we get justice and truth for Maurice McCabe, Keith Harrison and for others who have been wronged, in my view, in this situation, but surely there is an onus on us that when we have legislation on this area, which passed Committee Stage, was before the Houses for 11 years and that was approved by the Attorney General, to use it.  There were contentious parts of it related to the right of a Government to suppress the report of a tribunal in the cases of national security or relations with third member states, which could be forgotten, but the core elements of it, which came from a Law Reform Commission report and a recommendation of the Moriarty tribunal, could be introduced in this House and in the Seanad in a very short period and the tribunal of investigation we are setting up could take place under new laws that would not allow for the type of gravy train that we possibly could see from members of the legal professional and people who would come before the tribunal. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017021600002#F02100","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1487243400,"counter":757,"content":"<p>Deputy Pearse Doherty raised this the other day in the D&aacute;il, and rightly so.

It would provide a one-stop-shop for people seeking information on inquiries.

Clearly, we have that now.  Public inquiries are <i>ad hoc<\/i>bodies by their nature, and their structure and personnel should reflect this.  The commission weighed all of these matters but it did not recommend the establishment of a permanent standing inspectorate.

This would provide those charged with establishing and running public inquiries easy access to those precedents and experience, including legislation, procedural issues, the drafting of terms of reference and administrative matters.  That report was back in 2005, the year after the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 was enacted.

I have always thought it might even have the capacity to carry out a scoping exercise as to whether a commission of investigation or a public inquiry might be necessary on issues of serious public concern.

As a consequence, the drugs issue, the deprivation issue, the neglect issue, the mental health issue and the complex issue of proper educational facilities have all been there.  The attempt was to create a template there which could apply in other cities in which we might have similar problems.  It is really about co-ordinating effort between all of the existing community development.  There has to be buy-in from the community assisted by local authorities and, where necessary, State agencies.  That will be the value of the Mulvey report, to be published this evening.<\/p> <p>  There have been other introductions by the Department of Finance.  For instance, there is the older buildings initiative between the canals in Dublin.  It is now moving to a point at which there can be reconstruction or renovation of commercial premises to convert them into habitable living conditions in different towns.  As the Deputy is well aware, in lots of towns around Ireland, much of the stagnation has either been because of the acquisition of properties by banks or sometimes because of family positions.  The Government published its Action Plan for Jobs as well as its programme for the realisation of the potential of rural Ireland, including towns.  That draws together all of the initiatives out there, which allows for benefit to be drawn down to most areas.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, the Deputy's point about the involvement of the local authority is central.  The north inner city cannot be developed in the way that one would like without the particular involvement of Dublin City Council.  That ranges from painting signposts to restoring windows, fixing footpaths and traffic lights and all of that.  In other words, the physical manifestation of what the north inner city is impacted greatly upon by the involvement of the Dublin City Council together with the communities, which must have a direct input into this.  In the context of it being a template for other areas, I hope that it will point a signal as to how to co-ordinate all of these things and use the public representatives working with communities, the local authorities or whatever to generally improve the lot and make it more attractive than it is.

While the main focus is on meeting the statistical requirements of government, the information published by the CSO is also used by public bodies, business, universities, research institutes and the general public.  There is a significant international dimension to the work of the CSO.  EU institutions, the IMF, the OECD and other international bodies are all important users of official statistics.  These bodies also have a significant role in defining and monitoring standards for the compilation of comparable information and the CSO subscribes to the standards set out in the UN fundamental principles of official statistics and the European statistics code of practice.<\/p> <p>  The net allocation in 2016 amounted to &euro;82.081 million which included funding for the census of population.  The net allocation in 2017 is &euro;48.584 million.  Funding is provided for core outputs and additional significant projects, including the publication of outputs from the 2016 census of population.  The CSO is also implementing a long-term programme of change for how it organises household surveys in order that it will be able to meet future information needs as efficiently as possible.  In 2017 it will publish about 300 releases and publications.  All statistics are published online.  Members of the public are increasingly aware of, and able to access, statistics and indicators on the social, economic and environmental issues which affect their daily lives.  Recent well received publications include Life in 1916 Ireland: Stories from Statistics and Brexit: Ireland and the UK in Numbers.<\/p> <p>  The CSO's statement of strategy 2016 to 2019 gives priority to delivering the core statistics needed for policy, while keeping a strong focus on cost reduction.  The office continues to meet all of its commitments under the public service reform programme and is implementing a programme of reform and continuous business process improvement in the collection and processing of statistics.  The report from the economic statistics review group convened by the CSO has been published, with the CSO's response.  The recommendations made in the group's report focus on how best to provide an insight for users into domestic activity, given the highly globalised nature of the Irish economy.  The CSO will implement the recommendations made incrementally from mid-2017.<\/p> <p>  The CSO is taking a lead role in developing the Irish statistical system by working closely with other Departments and public bodies to promote a more coherent approach to meeting our data needs.  It has developed a code of practice for the Irish statistical system.  It also strongly promotes the development of a national data infrastructure which will provide for better co-ordination and greater exploitation of the rich data sources available across the system.  It will also lead to a greater understanding of the importance of data in supporting policy and decision-making and delivering efficiencies in public service provision.  Making better use of data throughout the public sector is an important part of public service reform and will contribute to more evidence-informed decision-making and better measurement of policy outcomes.  Better co-ordination and greater use of administrative data also contribute to reducing the burden on data providers.  Since 2008 the CSO has continued to reduce the response burden of its non-agricultural business surveys.  When measured from 2008, the burden to 2015 decreased by 37.1%, exceeding the target reduction of 25% over this timeframe.  <\/p> <p>  The CSO Vote for 2017 provides for a total of 755 staff.  This represents a decrease from 843 in 2016 and reflects the cyclical nature of the work of the office, including the census of population.  I commend the values and principles which inform the CSO's work.  The CSO makes an important contribution to Ireland's public policy by providing a high quality and, most  importantly, an independent statistical service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017021600002#K01500","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1487243400,"counter":819,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.
