Agreed.  On matters arising, the note circulated to members last night outlined the options available to us to examine the issue of public sector allowances in the short timeframe between now and the budget.  The proposal is that the committee should concentrate on the big allowances in terms of cost and application.  It is suggested that in order to get a balanced view of these payments the committee should give the trade union movement an opportunity to make a presentation and that in this context, the ICTU be invited to make a presentation.  We could start with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and use the information provided in the business cases, together with information supplied by Accounting Officers, to stress-test the main allowances, covering the bulk of the figure of &euro;1.4 billion.  A timeframe is suggested that would see a report published two weeks from the budget.  The committee will appoint a rapporteur to assist members in dealing with this issue in the light of the massive amount of paperwork that will be involved.  We agreed to this proposal last week.

It is also the primary State funding authority for the universities, institutes of technology and certain other designated higher education institutions.  The authority's expenditure and disbursements to higher education institutions in 2011 amounted to a total of &euro;1.37 billion.  Recurrent grants to institutions accounted for &euro;1.2 billion, or approximately 88% of the total expenditure.  Other significant distributions related to capital grants of some &euro;48 million and research grants amounting to &euro;95 million.  It should be noted that the Department of Education and Skills also disburses capital grants to the institutes of technology.<\/p><p>  The HEA received a clear audit opinion in respect of the 2011 financial statements.  However, the certificate draws attention to the existence of balances held in the pension control accounts in five of the universities, which they treat as liabilities due to the authority.  The background to the accounts is dealt with in the special report.<\/p><p>  The pension control balances contribute to the large cash balances of over &euro;700 million held by the institutions, at the end of the academic year 2011, in commercial bank accounts, which are dealt with in the special report.  It concludes that it may be worthwhile reviewing the State's wider treasury management policy and considering the merits of providing for a sweeping-up of surplus funding in third level institutions and other State bodies.  The HEA informed us that it was taking steps to slow the flow of funding to the institutions around the year end.  Last week, Deputy Fleming asked if we could get an update to 2012.  The end of year for the universities was 30 September, so it was not feasible to have something ready for the Deputy.  However, I will provide an update as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  Control over remuneration levels and employee numbers are matters shared between the authority and the Department.  Both were involved in oversight of the employment control framework for the higher education sector introduced in July 2009 and updated on a number of occasions thereafter.  Overall, the restrictions resulted in a reduction in staff numbers within the third level education sector by an estimated 7.3% between the end of 2008 and the end of 2010.  Over the same period, full-time student numbers increased by an estimated 10.5%.

In considering the report and in preparing for our meeting today with the committee, two principal considerations were uppermost in our minds.  First, the collective responsibility of higher education institutions and relevant Government departments and agencies to secure maximum return for State investment in higher education and, second, the importance of positioning the sector to make the maximum contribution possible to economic recovery and future growth.<\/p><p>  We have provided a detailed brief to the committee.  It may be somewhat long but we felt that the issues required the fullest background and explanation and I hope the brief has achieved that.  I do not intend to deal with the issues in any great detail in this opening statement but in the interests of ensuring the best use of time, I will focus on three areas in particular.  Obviously, I and my colleagues are available to answer any questions members of the committee may have.  <\/p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has raised issues relating to the treatment of cash balances and to treasury management in the institutions.  Specifically, the report asks whether there is a case for reviewing the State's wider treasury management policy.  The report also noted that any such review would need to take account of the return to the institutions, the impact on the banking system, as well as the level of Government borrowing.  The HEA is entirely open to such a review.  It is relevant to note that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is considering the issue of treasury management generally.  In addition, it is also relevant for the committee to note that in respect of the higher education sector, the HEA met the National Treasury Management Agency in February of this year to discuss whether there are immediate opportunities for NTMA to manage cash balances for the institutions.  Arising from that meeting it was clear that the existing arrangements of higher education institutions are significantly better than those which the NTMA would be able to offer.  However, it is important to note that we will keep the situation under review as will the institutions themselves, in order to ensure that if opportunities arise or circumstances change, then these are exploited.<\/p><p>  More generally, I would like to comment on the issue of the level of cash balances in the sector.  I wish to emphasise that cash balances are not equivalent to surpluses and do not in any sense imply an over-funded system.  The balances represent cash holdings of the institutions at a point in time, arising from a variety of sources.  We have set that out in more detail in our background briefing.  As it happens, the date on which the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is based is the time when cash balances are particularly high, that is, September.  Our own analysis shows that much of the cash in place is committed against current and future liabilities.  Examples would include moneys that are ring-fenced for requirements such as pension liabilities, as mentioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Another example is funds put aside to meet future liabilities from section 843 developments, where capital projects were undertaken in partnership with private developers, on the basis that the institutions would purchase assets at a specified future time.  In addition, I would ask the committee to have regard for the fact that higher education institutions, as complex organisations, need to hold certain levels of cash to ensure that salaries and other liabilities are met in a timely way and that opportunities that arise can be exploited.  The provision of upfront funding for research activity is also essential.  <\/p><p>  As a general rule, the advice to the HEA from an expert group on the issue was to the effect that up to 60 days worth of cash is necessary to enable higher education institutions to operate effectively and prudently.  The committee should also note that we are not just discussing cash balances that arise from public funds.  Some 40% or thereabouts of the income of higher education institutions comes from non-Exchequer sources, a very positive situation which is very much to be encouraged.  The HEA has been alert to excessive cash balances.  To address the situation in so far as funds allocated by the HEA are concerned, we have slowed down funding transfers to higher education institutions to take account of cash flows by rescheduling core grant and fee payments and having much stricter payment arrangements for PRTLI projects.  Arrangements have also been put in place to facilitate the payment of the student contribution in two instalments.  These have all reduced the amount of cash in the system at any one time and will have an ongoing impact in that regard.  We will continue to monitor the situation and in addition, it is worth noting that the Department of Education and Skills and the HEA are considering the issue of the payment of research funding in advance and how that can be dealt with in the context of cash balances.  This will require consultation with a range of government agencies and Departments.<\/p><p>  I will now move on to the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to Waterford Institute of Technology.  The report notes that there were failures of control in certain aspects of the operation of the institute, specifically in the office of president.  The report also notes that the institute has recognised these failures and put in place new control mechanisms to address this.  The HEA agrees fully with the conclusions of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is very disappointing when failures of this kind are identified, to say the least.  On the other hand, the fact that they are identified demonstrates that, taken together, the full suite of control and accountability measures do work to identify and remedy failures.  Failures of this kind also prompt the accountable bodies - the governing bodies and the HEA for instance - to look again at how systems can be revised and reformed.  Apart from the cost of the failures themselves, a greater cost would be that we fail to learn the lessons when these situations arise.  <\/p><p>  In response to the situation in Waterford Institute of Technology, the HEA contacted all the other institutes to ensure that the appropriate controls, so deficient - and identified as being deficient - in Waterford, were in place and fully operational.  We understand that the detailed arrangements vary across the institutes, but I can assure the committee that we are satisfied that appropriate controls are now in place.  We are considering whether there would be value in requiring a consistent approach across the entire system and whether that would be practical.  The committee should also note that such measures are in place within an accountability and control environment that includes legislative responsibilities, accountability to this committee, internal audit arrangements, audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, as well as an agreed code of governance which sets out a comprehensive approach to the treatment of issues such as financial controls, risk management, accountability and transparency.  Robust processes and systems combined with constant vigilance, regular reviews of processes and procedures and prompt reaction to any failures are key components of an effective accountability and control system.  <\/p><p>  The committee has, at a previous meeting, dealt in detail with the issue of unauthorised allowances.  I hope today that I can assure members that the matter has been dealt with in a satisfactory way.  Allowances have stopped, a recurrence of such payments will not arise and the matter has been brought to a conclusion in a way that underlines the seriousness with which both the HEA and the Department and Skills view the issue, without further jeopardising a difficult funding situation in the universities or damaging the quality of the student experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012100400007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1349343600,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Can we publish your statement, Mr. Boland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012100400007#F00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349343600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012100400007#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1349343600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Before we go to our first speaker, Deputy Donohoe, I have a few comments to make.

It was immediately after the freedom of information request, which was submitted in March.  On 17 May 2011 we wrote to Waterford Institute of Technology asking for details of the situation.  The institute reported to us in July and we found the report to be unsatisfactory.  We had asked WIT for details relating to several questions.  We asked whether any of the expenditure was used for purposes other than that of the institute; whether any of the expenditure fell outside normal processes for expenditure control, including tendering; whether, if any such expenditure did occur, the system of financial control and review in the institute allowed such expenditure to occur; about the specific controls in place in respect of expenditure incurred by the office of the president; whether any appropriate measures have been taken to improve systems of internal control; and about other actions that the governing body proposed to take in this matter.<\/p><p>  We received a report, often referred to as the first Deloitte report, in response to these issues.  We took the view that the report did not deal with a range of issues in sufficient detail.  As a result of several meetings and telephone conversations with the authorities in the institute a second report was commissioned and, I understand, is more or less complete now but its publication has been delayed for legal reasons.  However, we have asked the institution to press forward with the publication of the report and with making that report available to the HEA and the Department unless there are specific legal reasons why this cannot be done.  We moved quickly to establish the nature and extent of the problem.  In particular we were keen to ensure that the institute moved rapidly towards putting in place the type of controls, specifically in respect of the office of president, which were necessary.  On that point we sought to respond reasonably quickly.<\/p><p>  The question the chairman raised about what the HEA did and why this happened or was allowed to happen over ten years is a little more difficult to answer, but I do not mean that in an evasive way.  The HEA is part of a system of accountability and control in respect of public funding and expenditure in the higher education system.  The system includes the institutions and the chief officer and the governing bodies have specific functions under legislation.  The system includes a code of governance and deals with issues relating to internal audit committees and the way in which these committees interact with the governing body of the institutes to ensure an accountability culture in each of the institutes.  It is at this level that the detail of issues arise in respect of accountability.  The Higher Education Authority has a significant role to ensure appropriate procedures and processes are in place in institutions and that they work.  It keeps the situation under review and develops alternative solutions when and if difficulties are identified.  The HEA has put in place a code of governance for the institutes and the universities which is altogether consistent with the code of governance for State agencies.  We review the accounts of the institutions on an annual basis and there are a range of other audits and account reviews that takes place.  Apart from the institutional responsibilities and those of the HEA there are responsibilities for the Comptroller and Auditor General and this committee.<\/p><p>  Given our mandate and resources, amounting to some 58 staff, it is not practical for the HEA, to be able to interrogate the detail of the accounts of institutions.  That is, properly, a function of the chief officer, who is the accountable person, and the governing body along with their combined internal control procedures.  It would be wrong for the HEA to try to take to itself the capacity to do that work.  The HEA would be unable to do it and we would be taking on a responsibility that ultimately we could not deliver on.  Further, we would be absolving the institutions and the management of the institutions from their statutory and fiduciary responsibilities for the moneys they receive.<\/p><p>  One objective of the HEA is to create a climate of accountability in the institutions whereby they understand that they are accountable first and foremost.  It is not possible for an agency such as the HEA to surface the type of detail that arose in this case.  However, it is possible and it is our responsibility when the need arises to act as quickly as possible to ensure that whatever required systems reforms are carried out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012100400008#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1349344200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>The HEA has failed to instil that culture of audit and accountability in WIT over a ten year period.

It is clear from this ten year period that management completely ignored any effort by the HEA, if an effort was made, to get it to perform properly.<\/p><p>  Rather than refer to the single department or president, have you looked at the audit committee, the governing body, the role of Mr. McFeely and the attempt he made to advise on some of the errors that were going on or the spend that was being made, and what was the outcome of that inquiry? <\/p><p>  I asked you about specific spend relating to that flight, for example.

I fully anticipated the question and I hope to help the committee as best I can in all of these issues.<\/p><p>  It is somewhat overstating the situation to say that for ten years the system of control and accountability in Waterford Institute of Technology had broken down or did not exist.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's office has said WIT is, by and large, a well-run organisation.  There can be no question but that there was a breakdown of accountability and control in respect of one area of expenditure.  One can call that disappointing or shocking, but it certainly should not have occurred.   <\/p><p>  Without wishing to limit its importance, no system of control can guarantee against human failure, or human ingenuity to get around the controls.  In the first instance, the job of an institute of technology is to ensure that the processes are as foolproof as possible and that they are regularly reviewed.  It is our job to ensure that is happening.  It is said we waited ten years.  In fairness to the HEA, we did not know this was happening, nor could we have known, until April or May 2011.  That is the reality in which we are operating.<\/p><p>  With regard to Dr. Port, I understand that, as of yesterday, there is new information on that situation.  As far as I can recall, the HEA knew nothing about the presence, or not, of Dr. Port in Waterford.  We knew he had been appointed by the Department of Education and Science to do a review of issues regarding the application for university status.  We knew nothing, however, of his comings and goings and had no involvement in them.  That is as much as we were involved in it.  Obviously, we had no knowledge at all of the chartering of private jets to bring him to meetings.<\/p><p>  I have been given a note relating to the flights which, if I may, I will read into the record.<blockquote>During the course of the institute's meeting with the Public Accounts Committee on Thursday 27 September, the institute's response relied upon the information included in the Deloitte report.  This report stated, based on clarification by the former president, that this transaction related to the charter of a plane to transport a visitor from Waterford to Dublin.  This view has been further reinforced by the statement of the former chairman on 28 September 2012, in which he confirmed the plane was chartered to fly Dr. Jim Port from Waterford to Dublin and stated that, &quot;he was comfortable authorising and, indeed, organising it at the time&quot;.  <br \/><br \/>  Based upon your query [that is the query of this committee] we have further investigated the matter.  The following has come to light.  An invoice for the sum of &euro;4,200 was approved for payment by both the former president and the former chairman.  The invoice refers to a flight on 29 June 2007, which is at odds with the timing of the trip made by Dr. Port in March 2007.  The narrative on the invoice states that it related to the hire of aircraft and pilot for a return flight from Filton, England, to Dublin, including all landing and handling charges at Filton airport and Dublin Airport.  When the invoice was presented for payment the institute's finance office queried this transaction in relation to origin, cost and detail.  The president's office confirmed that it was in order to pay.  <br \/><br \/>  Based on the information to hand, it would appear that the invoice did not relate to a trip from Waterford to Dublin, but a different trip.  The institute is currently investigating this matter further and has been in contact with representatives of the airline involved and is awaiting their response.  The invoice for the Waterford to Dublin flight in March 2007 amounted to &euro;769.56.  Until further information can be obtained in relation to both invoices, only the former president and the former chair can fully clarify the matter.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012100400009#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1349344800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>There were two flights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012100400009#H00700","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349344800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Yes, a return flight and a one-way flight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012100400009#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1349344800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, do you wish to add to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012100400009#H00900","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349344800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>There were three flights.

In February 2007, the Minister appointed Dr. Jim Port, of JM Consulting, to conduct a preliminary examination of the application, having regard, first, to the national strategy for the development of Irish higher education, second, to implications for regional development in the south east in the context of the national strategy and, third, to any likely implications for the overall structure of higher education in Ireland.  Dr. Port submitted his report to the Department on 31 July 2007, we published it in February 2008 and it is available on the Department's website.<\/p><p>  That was his particular role.  Part of his undertaking of that role was a visit to WIT to meet various stakeholders.  We understand he was given the agenda for whom he was to meet during that visit by the officers of WIT.

Obviously, the Department was fully aware of what was coming through the system prior to the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General being produced by way of the annual audit and concerns being expressed.

Did the Department just wash its hands of the money the minute it wrote the cheque for &euro;1.2 billion if it had no memorandum of understanding?  I am not suggesting there was anything untoward but I find it unacceptable that a Department, including its Accounting Officer, would hand over &euro;1.2 billion of taxpayers' money to any organisation, be it another State body or otherwise, without a formal written memorandum of understanding outlining who is responsible and the roles and obligations of each party.  Is this normal?  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General might advise us whether there would be a memorandum of understanding between the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the NRA, for example?

It is not that we are questioning the practice of the past and that we did not have very regular and detailed meetings with the HEA and a regular exchange of information.  We felt it would be very helpful to capture the various roles and responsibilities clearly.  For example, the HSE would be operating in the context of the code of governance for State agencies and making regular statements to both the Comptroller and Auditor General and ourselves.  We felt it would be helpful, however, to capture generally an overall picture in the memorandum of understanding.

Now, we have this new organisation that we all know as SUSI &ndash; Student Universal Support Ireland.  I have been dealing with it on behalf of constituents.  I understand it will make its payment to the third level colleges in ten monthly instalments, as opposed to the big lump sums local authorities made.  The new approach is a far better way.  Local authorities will be making cash payments to the third level colleges.  Student Universal Support Ireland will be making payments to them also, and the HEA will be making payments.  This is probably why large sums of cash are received.  It would be better if the Department of Education and Skills were responsible.  Most of the money comes from the delegates' budget.  Payments to local authorities, through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, are spread out over the year.  Bearing in mind the Department's cash flow management and the cost to the Exchequer - I am not suggesting that having cash means having a surplus - I believe it would be better, in terms of the overall management of the State's cash position, if the money were allocated in a more even way.  Other arms of the State are paying overdraft interest.  I am sure the HSE and local authorities are doing so, while, on the other hand, the delegates' organisation is earning interest.  The cash flow requirement needs to be managed a little better.<\/p><p>  With regard to bank concessions to the third level colleges, the figure for 2008-09 was &euro;9.4 million, that for 2009-10 was &euro;11 million and that for 2010-11 was &euro;9.9 million.

I was trying to think it through and I definitely have met the chief executive and the chair at least three times since I have been in the job.  I believe we will meet again next week.

I thank the witnesses for the documentation they have just circulated to members.  A couple of points came to mind and in the interim, I have had a chance to look at the Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche report.  It makes specific reference to travel in respect of the Bell Airways charter of a plane to transport a visitor from Waterford to Dublin in 2007 for &euro;4,200.  That payment was entered in the accounts under the miscellaneous heading.  That was not the appropriate place for such an expense.  I suggest to Mr. Boland that in future, the HEA should seek an analysis of miscellaneous expenditure in any account it receives.  It is the first heading one should look at because if one examines the trend in the relevant years, the actual miscellaneous figure was &euro;58,000 in 2008 and &euro;27,000 in 2007.  The question is whether that payment was tucked in there.<\/p><p>  Second, I refer to the invoices with which members have been provided and I have read Mr. Redmond O'Donoghue's statement.  Basically, this makes reference to how it pertained to Dr. Port's stay in terms of WIT seeking university status.  First, it appears to me as though there were two and not three flights.  The invoice to Bell Airways is in respect of a flight taken on 31 March.  That was the invoice date and the invoice is No. 198.  It was invoiced to Fewer Harrington Lawlor &amp;amp; Partners, which is a firm of architects and planners.  It was referenced to Kieran Byrne, the former president of WIT.  That invoice was then sent by Fewer Harrington Lawlor &amp;amp; Partners as a single payment advice to WIT for the attention of Kieran Byrne.  As far as I can ascertain, this is the same payment and the same flight and it was a trip to Dublin with reference to Nicholas Fewer.  Did that flight involve Dr. Jim Port at all?  I seek clarification in this regard.  That Bel Airways invoice of 31 March was not to WIT but to Fewer Harrington Lawlor &amp;amp; Partners, which obviously was doing work for WIT.  The Fewer Harrington Lawlor &amp;amp; Partners invoice that went to WIT was for the attention of Kieran Byrne and was signed off by Kieran Byrne only and was dated 11 May.  Then there was a cheque requisition on 15 May for that particular payment.<\/p><p>  As for the infamous &euro;4,200 flight, there is an invoice from Bell Airways with no date on it.  It is addressed to no one as there is no addressee on the invoice.  It simply refers to flight on 29 June 2007, hire of aircraft and pilot for return flight from Filton, England to Dublin, including all handling and landing charges at Filton and Dublin Airport, &euro;4,200.  It does not give a date, as one normally would expect with an invoice, does not give an addressee as to whom the invoice was sent and does not state when the invoice was paid.  It is signed off by Kieran Byrne and what looks to me like P. O'Donoghue.  While I am open to correction, it looks like it was signed off by the former chairman.<\/p><p>  I seek clarification on this issue.  While people might say it is not huge in the context of the overall budget, in the context of controls and generally, when one looks at the other aspects regarding the use of moneys within the former president's office, it must be open to question.  The Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills should provide members with an overview with regard to the period in question.  He should indicate who was paying Dr. Port's consultancy fee and to whom was he reporting?  Was he reporting to the Secretary General of the then Department of Education and Science or to the Minister for Education and Science?  Who was Minister for Education and Science at the time?  Alternatively, was Dr. Port reporting to the President of WIT?  Was the Secretary General aware of this flight?  Does he have concerns about it?  It appears as though there was a flight on 20 March and then a second flight on 29 June.  The Secretary General should outline who he understands to have been on the flight and for how long Dr. Port was here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012100400015#O02500","speaker":"1060","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349349000,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Dr. Port was appointed by the Minister at the time, Mary Hanafin, and he reported back to her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012100400016#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1349349000,"counter":368,"content":"<p>So, he was not reporting to the president of WIT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012100400016#P00300","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349349000,"counter":369,"content":"<p>No, but the review was a review of an application by WIT.

Unfortunately, I did not call first on Deputy Donohue because I was shocked by it not addressing the issues.  I based the questions in my contribution on the information that we had at that time.  We were not aware of the statement that Mr. Boland then read out; nobody was.  The other matter of which we were not aware - we must be balanced here in regard to Professor Byrne - was the invoices and the press statement from a press release of last week, which were presented to the committee following a request from Deputies Donohue and O'Donnell.  It would have helped us in how we framed our questions, and might have taken some of the frustration and anger out of the exchanges and the debate, had we been told, as the press release indicates, that the then chairman, Mr. Redmond O'Donoghue, had authorised and, indeed, organised the trips at the time.  That, to me, is significant information because up to now we were talking about the spend from the president's office and how he conducted the business at WIT.  It needs to be put on record that in this particular statement there is significant information which shows that the expenditure on this item was not only at the whim of the president and was not only something that was being done, but was authorised and organised by the chairman.  That is what the statement says.  I have just had time to look at it and read it.<\/p><p>  The second matter I want to clarify is that during the course of the exchange I asked the clerk to the committee to double-check on the e-mails that would have come in to the committee.

The HEA is in the process of investigating the sustainability of funding in higher education.  Sustainability is not just a question of how to get more money and where to put it.  It is also a question of how it is used.  In that context, one of the areas we want to explore is industrial relations matters and human resource management to find out how we might quantify the kind of flexibility universities and institutes could be given and how this might impact on their capacity to manage their resources.

An individual may leave Ireland because the laboratory facilities or the team members potentially available somewhere else are much better.

In light of the children's referendum, childhood obesity and being overweight must be factored into the issue of child protection.  It is well accepted that children are growing up in hostile, toxic environments where obesity is concerned.  As the committee has received a number of presentations, including many graphs and statistics, I will be statistic light this morning.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, one in five children in preschool is overweight or obese.  This is the 2012 figure and increases to one in four in terms of eight year olds.  The first communion is a milestone for children.  One in four children requires clothes that are larger than what would have been required some years ago.  Data from the late 1940s bring the issue into sharp focus, in that 14 year olds have gained 8 in. in height but are three stone heavier than their 1940s counterparts.  This disproportionate increase in weight is a large physical burden.<\/p><p>  We are in relative denial.  According to research, parents and society in general are accepting of children being overweight, &quot;generously sized&quot; or so on.  We do not recognise the issue.  There is clear evidence that obesity and being overweight track into adulthood.  One tends not to grow out of it.  If one is overweight or obese at ten years of age, one is twice as likely to be overweight or obese as an adult.  It is a real problem.<\/p><p>  Thanks to our new investigative facilities and the current level of technology, we know that children begin depositing fat and calcium in their arteries from the time they become overweight.  It is not confined to 50 year olds, 60 year olds and 70 year olds.  We are also finding overweight children as young as ten years of age with high blood pressure.  The terms &quot;overweight&quot; and &quot;obesity&quot; are not interchangeable, as they form part of a spectrum, but we tend to view obesity rather than overweight as being serious.  If a child is overweight, metabolic damage is being done to his or her system.  Of overweight children in the US, 50% show clear evidence of a metabolic syndrome, which is essentially pre-diabetes.  In Ireland, 9% of overweight 12 year olds have pre-diabetes.  Concrete evidence shows that there is nothing benign about being overweight as a child.<\/p><p>  Parenthood in general is a blame game, particularly so in the case of overweight children.  Is industry, parenting or something else to blame?  The information clearly points to society.  Genetics play a part, but we are over-reliant on this excuse.  Genes are switched on by environments.  If one is not exposed to certain environmental factors such as high-energy foods or inactivity, one's genetic predispositions will be less expressed.  This is an important consideration.<\/p><p>  There is some good news, in that early intervention and family intervention have been shown to work.  It is not down to the child alone and one cannot just send a child on a programme.  A change in or development of lifestyle is necessary.  Many statistics support this viewpoint.<br \/><i>safe<\/i>food has adopted a practical, evidence-based and realistic approach to the issues of healthy eating and tackling obesity.  Our mass media campaigns, our work in schools and the evidence base we have built through commissioning certain forms of research comprise an approach that is based on science, provides parents and others with practical tips and tries to influence policy, which is the reason we are at this meeting.<\/p><p>  The challenges are significant.  This is not a sprint, as there is no quick-fix solution.  It is a long-term project.  The goals set by the World Health Organization, WHO, and our European counterparts involve halting the increase.  We are not discussing something so dramatic as having a healthy childhood generation within three years.  After we have halted the increase, we will decrease the levels to what they were in 2000.  Most of us would consider that as being only yesterday.<\/p><p>  We are fighting the denial and stigma associated with this issue, as well as the fact that parents and society attach blame to the terms &quot;overweight&quot; and &quot;obese&quot;, which they perceive as being harsh.  A challenge for us is to produce information and campaigns that engage, are adequately hard-hitting and do not alienate people from the realities of the situation.<\/p><p>  Ireland possesses no exemplars of the final challenge facing <i>safe<\/i>food.  We are familiar with the economic situation.  There is no simple solution.  The basis of our work is energy balance, that is, changing the amount of high-energy food that is available everywhere and is marketed to children and changing what occurs in schools and homes.<\/p><p>  We have collectively been sitting on the sidelines or getting overexcited about individual pieces of research or advances in treatment methods, for example, diabetes drugs or bariatric surgery.  These merely manage the few, in that they only help a relatively small number of individuals who have extremely established diseases.  Although this is exciting, appeals in the short term and allows waiting lists for treatment to be discussed, we are giving it undue focus instead of concentrating on overweight children, the number of whom would fill the Aviva Stadium and Croke Park together.  By focusing on a minute number of children, we are neglecting prevention and wellness for the others.<\/p><p>  We do not have absolute answers - it would be dishonest and misleading of me to claim otherwise - but we have a pathway that will help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012100400003#B00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cliodhna Foley-Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349340000,"counter":487,"content":"<p>As you stated, the best line is about prevention and wellness and changing the message.

We have sent the committee documentation and we encourage questions but we are here to make the point for schools and their children to have less sugar.  We have been told by some eminent doctors, especially in the US, that sugar is now more hurtful to people than tobacco, which is a frightening prospect.  People must back that up as it cannot just be left as a statement.<\/p><p>  The World Health Organisation provides some general statistics and there is also the promotion of healthy diets and physical activity in school.  Fat versus sugar forms the basis of a new health debate.  Dr. Robert Lustig is an eminent physician in the US who has come up with wonderful material on this issue.  Calorie for calorie, sugar makes us fatter than any other food.  Sugar-free schools in Sweden, Denmark and the USA have undergone many studies, with results indicating that pupils become more healthy and attentive in such schools.  Statistics back up these findings.<\/p><p>  We recognise that diet is not the only element to consider and children must also be more aware of physical activity.  We do not want to keep hammering about not having sugar as everything is okay in moderation.  Nevertheless, we are here to explain how a sugar-free diet makes everybody healthier.

There should be a very clear and definite parental responsibility, as these are the people most critically involved in determining a child's diet.  There has been a significant change in lifestyles in recent years but there is a need to continue to emphasise the important legacy that parents give to children in terms of general health and well-being.

The main reason we are dealing with this issue is to make people aware of the damage that being overweight and obese can do to one's health.  It is important to show people how they can combat this problem.  Obesity levels in Ireland have risen dramatically in the past 20 years.  In the 1990s, only one in ten Irish men was obese, and the level today is put officially at one in four.  In the same period, the level of obesity among women has risen from 13% to 21%.  The fact of being overweight and obesity are now the most common childhood disorders in Europe.  Of all five to 12 year olds, one in ten is overweight and a further one in ten is obese.  In total, 22% of five to 12 year olds are now overweight or obese.  One in five Irish teenagers aged between 13 and 17 is overweight or obese, with 11% being overweight and 8% being obese.  There has been a significant increase in teenage obesity since 1990, with an eightfold increase in males, from 1% to 8%, and a twofold increase in females, from 3% to 6%.  Obesity and being overweight are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health.<\/p><p>  It is important that witnesses who appear before the committee tell us the truth, the facts and figures, and that is the reason the witnesses are before the committee today.

Many food products are advertised as healthy foods but they have a very high sugar content or a food product may be advertised as being 95% fat free, which means it has 5% fat content.  If one is lucky enough to find a food product that is low in sugar and fat content, one will find that it probably contains about one third of the total recommended daily salt content.  My question is how the consumer can choose foods, processed foods mainly, in a sensible and straightforward manner because one would nearly want a degree in nutrition to work out exactly what is in some of these foods.  One finds what appears to be a health food product but it transpires it is not healthy and some of the foods that are not marketed as healthy are far healthier than the ones being marketed and promoted as such.

There is a perception that it is more expensive to eat healthily than it is to eat junk food which, in that way at least, one can afford to feed one's children.

One of the most important things is that people need to count carbohydrates, although I know it is hard work.  I have a daughter with diabetes and all the time need to count the carbohydrates for her to know exactly how many doses of insulin she needs.  The more carbohydrates one needs, the more insulin one needs.  When one eats more food, the body processes more insulin and if one does not process all of the carbohydrates, they will be stored as fat.  That is the reason we are fat.  Reducing carbohydrates is the most important message of all. <\/p><p>  It is important to show from an early age in schools how to cook and eat.  Cadburys is producing a new chocolate bar with less than 100 calories and it will sell for 50p in Northern Ireland.  It states it will be brilliant because people will be slimmer.  That is false because all of these products contain more sugar.  When there is less fat in a product, there is more sugar to make it more tasty.  It is exactly the same in the case of salt and fat content.  What we have to do is to reduce the intake of sugar of children in order that real sugar comes from vegetables.

They examined the lifestyle of the family and discovered that the child who was aged 16 years and very overweight did not get up until 2 p.m.  When the doctor advised what the family needed to do, they simply did not want to hear it.  There seems to be a problem where some parents insist that it is everyone else's problem but their own, no matter how much information is put before them.  They cannot accept that the issue is not only one of food but also of exercise and lifestyle.  Schools are proactive, but parents need to be convinced that they must be involved at an early stage to make sure the problem does not reach the stage where medical advice is required.  There seems to be a problem in getting that information through to children and parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012100400007#F00500","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349341800,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I will answer two points briefly.

The next phase we were planning was to work on increasing parents' awareness of childhood obesity.  We started with adults because adult obesity is less contentious.   <\/p><p>  This brings us back to Senator Colm Burke's point.  This is a delicate and sensitive issue and it is easy to see education and responsibility as the solutions.  A person who has had a heart attack or a diagnosis of a serious illness will be much more amenable to lifestyle changes.  No one wants to be told his or her beautiful eight year old or preschooler who is a little overweight has a health problem.  This does not come easy for parents.  We need to normalise the measuring of weight and waist sizes in order that it is not seen as a criticism or an insult.
