I am conscious of the difficulties experienced by Irish citizens who are undocumented in the United States, and I have met and spoken with many of them on my working visits there, and also with the various groups who lobby on their behalf.<\/p><p>  I have maintained contact, both directly and through our Embassy in Washington, with many key players in Congress who are influential in steering the process of US immigration reform.  Over the last five months, both the Embassy and I have had direct contact with some 70 Members of the House of Representatives and their staff.   These have included Republican Congressman Paul Ryan, Chair of the House Budgetary Committee and former Vice-Presidential nominee; Republican Congressman Bob Goodlatte, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee and several other leading Republican members of that Committee, including Immigration Sub-Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy; Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi;  Chair of the Congressional Friends of Ireland, Pete King; with House Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and their staffs.   I have also maintained contact with key figures in the US Administration and with Irish-American community representatives. <\/p><p>  I have reiterated throughout all these contacts the Government&rsquo;s interest in all aspects of immigration reform and in particular our interest in seeing an overall agreement reached which provides relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and a facility for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US.  <\/p><p>  In this context, we very much welcomed the US Senate&rsquo;s approval of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill by a 68-32 margin on 27 June last year.    <\/p><p>  Following passage of that Bill, the issue has been under consideration in the Republican controlled House of Representatives.   Public comments and private conversations which I, the Taoiseach and our Embassy in Washington DC had with leaders of the House Republican caucus,  had given rise to expectations that the House would take up consideration of a series of immigration reform bills last autumn.  Unfortunately that did not come to pass.  <\/p><p>  Early last month, further public comments from Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Chief Whip Kevin McCarthy again raised hopes that the Republican leadership in the House saw the need to proceed with immigration reform.  To that end, the leadership prepared a set of draft principles that would guide their action on immigration in the House and presented them to the members of their caucus for consideration at a meeting on 30 January 2014.<\/p><p>  Informed by that discussion, Speaker Boehner gave a press conference on 6 February in which he expressed doubts that the House would pass immigration reform legislation this year.  He did reassert that immigration reform is something that needs to get done and that he would continue to consult his members.<\/p><p>  Given that expectations had again been raised, these and other comments are disappointing.  However, it is important that we keep our focus on the endgame.  The Government through our Ambassador in Washington DC and her team are continuing an extensive outreach and engagement with members of Congress and with the Irish groups and organisations who are lobbying for immigration reform.  We are monitoring the ongoing discussions within the Republican Party and continuing to press the case for addressing the concerns of our undocumented and to provide for a future legal flow for Irish immigrants to the United States.  The forthcoming St Patrick&rsquo;s Day visits to the United States will provide a further important opportunity to engage with US leaders in support of our immigration objectives and to assess the prospects for the weeks and months ahead.  We remain fully committed to the effort to achieve an outcome that addresses the needs of our undocumented and creates a legal path for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900068#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900068#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[8111\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900068#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has noted the resumption of reunification talks in Cyprus; if he supports the resumption of these talks; and if he has discussed this issues with his Cypriot counterpart.","asker":"1037","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the agreement announced on 11 February 2014 by the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders on the resumption of settlement talks. <\/p><p>  I believe that the Joint Declaration agreed by the two leaders lays a solid foundation for the re-launch of negotiations for a fair and viable comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. <\/p><p>  Neither I nor the T&aacute;naiste have had the opportunity to discuss these latest developments with our Cypriot opposite numbers, but I would like to welcome the political leadership shown by those involved in the process thus far. <\/p><p>  I would urge those involved, having agreed the principles on which the negotiations will be based, to engage fully in the talks and to work in a spirit of good faith, under the auspices of the United Nations.

The second round of peace talks focused on resolving political differences between the parties in the country opened last week in Addis Ababa. The EU, through its Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, is closely monitoring the peace efforts and strongly supports the role being played by the East African regional grouping, IGAD, in mediating the ceasefire and peace talks.  <\/p><p>  The situation in South Sudan was discussed by EU Foreign Ministers most recently at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on 20 January.  There was very strong concern at the reports of widespread human rights violations and abuses, including ethnic targeting.  The Council welcomed the African Union&rsquo;s decision to establish a Commission to investigate the human rights violations and abuses. <\/p><p>  The African Union Commissioner for Peace and Security briefed EU Ambassadors in Addis Ababa on 7 February on the situation in South Sudan and progress on the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry into human rights abuses.<\/p><p>  Ireland strongly shares the concerns about the violence in South Sudan and the devastating impact on the civilian population.  According to current estimates, there are more than 700,000 people displaced inside South Sudan with a further 145,000 displaced in neighbouring countries.  This is close to 10% of the population.  The scale of the humanitarian needs is placing an enormous burden on humanitarian agencies to respond to the crisis.  Some aid agencies estimate that by June 2014 more than 3 million people could be at risk of food insecurity. <\/p><p>  In the last two years, Ireland has provided &euro;5 million in funding to the UN-managed Common Humanitarian Fund for South Sudan to help UN agencies target the most critical humanitarian needs. In addition, Ireland provided over &euro;3 million to NGOs operating in South Sudan to improve food security across the country. In addition, in response to the recent violence, two airlifts with 45 tonnes of emergency supplies, valued at &euro;400,000, were dispatched to South Sudan from Irish Aid pre-positioned stocks in Ghana.  A further airlift will be dispatched to Uganda in the coming days to assist South Sudanese refugees displaced inside Uganda.  I am currently considering how Ireland can best respond to the crisis this year though our ongoing support for the UN-managed Common Humanitarian Fund. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900068#WRA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cross-Border Co-operation","counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900068#WRA01250"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[8020\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900068#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has had any recent discussions with members of the Northern Ireland Executive in relation to the potential to develop further cross-Border trade; if the potential of the Narrow Water Bridge project has been discussed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These have included my recent meetings in Dublin and Belfast with the First Minister and deputy First Minister, one of which was the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) Institutional meeting on 10 January, 2014, and with other members of the Northern Ireland Executive at the most recent NSMC Plenary meeting on 8 November 2013.  The Narrow Water Bridge project was among the issues discussed during those meetings.<\/p><p>I believe that there is scope for increasing the levels of intra-island trade and economic activity including in border areas.  This in turn can safeguard jobs, and encourage cross-border investments. My colleague Minister Richard Bruton has responsibility for the NSMC Trade and Business Sector and meets regularly with Minister Arlene Foster to oversee the work of InterTrade Ireland, the North South Implementation Body which promotes trade and business development on the island. InterTrade Ireland has <i>a range <\/i>  of programmes designed to encourage trade and business growth across the island and to create an environment where it is easier to do cross-border business, and it is doing excellent work in this area. <\/p><p>  In addition, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation co-funds a total of 28 projects under the Enterprise Development theme of the Interreg IVA Programme (2009-2015), together with both the administration in Northern Ireland and the EU.  These include projects addressing barriers to trade faced by micro-enterprises in border counties, assisting with market entry support, developing cross border linkages, business support mentoring, capacity building for SMEs, schemes for assisting specific enterprise sectors, the provision of two Enterprise Centres and the provision of a major Science Park. <\/p><p>  There is also close engagement and cooperation between the relevant Enterprise Development bodies, Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards, with their counterparts in Northern Ireland on a range of mutually beneficial issues. <\/p><p>  At the NSMC Plenary meeting last November it was agreed that Ministers from both administrations would consider their priorities for further North\/South co-operation in their respective areas with the focus of these discussions on where they could lead to economic recovery, job creation, the best use of public funds and the most effective delivery of services.  <\/p><p>  The shortfall in the funding for the Narrow Water Bridge project arose when construction tender prices came in at nearly double the estimated cost. <\/p><p>  As the additional funding required to deliver the project had not been secured, on 15 November 2013 the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) withdrew the letter of offer of &euro;17.4 million in INTERREG IVA funding.  The SEUPB has since been exploring options for the reallocation of the funding which had been earmarked for Narrow Water to other eligible projects capable of being delivered by December 2015 to ensure that the drawdown of funds from the European Commission is maximised and that no money is lost.  <\/p><p>  The priority for both Administrations, North and South, is to ensure that the significant amount of EU funding which has been withdrawn from the Narrow Water Bridge is secured for the benefit of the economies of the island.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to work together with colleagues in the Executive to that end and I confirmed this at my meeting with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister on 10 January 2014.  I appreciate that there is disappointment in the Louth\/Down border area but I assure you that my colleagues in Government and I remain conscious of the potential benefits of the Narrow Water Bridge project.<\/p><p>  While the priority was not to lose the EU funding involved, I want to stress that at the Plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council Ministers remained supportive of the concept of the Narrow Water Bridge. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900068#WRA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":21,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900068#WRA01550"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[7992\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900068#WRA01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the calls for legal action to be taken against the illegal decision of the Israeli authorities to approve the construction of over 500 apartments in occupied east Jerusalem earlier this month; and the action he will take regarding this escalating attack on Palestinian rights.","asker":"1015","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[8108\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900068#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on Israel's decision to approve building plans for 558 new homes in the occupied West Bank; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":24,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 31 together. <\/p><p>  I have consistently made very clear the Government&rsquo;s strong criticism of, and opposition to, Israeli settlements and settlement expansion, which are illegal under international law and constitute an obstacle to peace.  The Israeli Government, and Israeli public opinion, are in no doubt whatever about our views on this issue.  I strongly condemn the recent announcement by Israel of building permits for 558 new units in East Jerusalem, and I urge the Israeli authorities to reconsider this decision.  <\/p><p>  On 5 February, High Representative Ashton released a statement on behalf of the European Union expressing deep concern at the announcement and stating that these plans could put at risk the prospects of Jerusalem becoming the capital of two states and, in particular, the territorial contiguity between East Jerusalem and the southern West Bank.  In December 2013, the EU Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions which strongly warned against actions that undermine the current negotiations and, in that regard, deplored Israel&rsquo;s continuous expansion of settlements.<\/p><p>  Settlement announcements such as these during the current peace talks have clearly been damaging to confidence in the process.

The referendum text did not specify what levels the quotas on migrants should be set at.

The Federal Council has said that it intends to present a draft law to the Swiss Parliament by the end of this year.<\/p><p>The referendum outcome is a worrying development, with far reaching implications for EU- Switzerland relations, not least because any new Swiss legislation introducing quotas on immigration by EU citizens would be incompatible with the existing EU-Switzerland Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons which has been in place since 2002.

The Council called on all actors to refrain from violence and dissociate themselves from radical actions. We recalled that demonstrations should be pursued by peaceful means. <\/p><p>  The Council made clear that the authorities should take all necessary measures to respect and protect the fundamental rights of Ukrainian  citizens and that the  continuous targeting of organisers and participants of peaceful protesters as well as of journalists must be stopped immediately. We have urged the authorities to investigate all acts of violence in a transparent and impartial manner and bring the perpetrators to justice. The current atmosphere of impunity which allows for such acts to take place must be addressed.<\/p><p>  While the Council welcomed recent steps, in particular the decision on 28 January by the Ukrainian Parliament to revoke the laws which unduly restricted the exercise of fundamental freedoms, we also indicated that further efforts are necessary to find a durable solution to the current political crisis. We have urged all sides to seek, though an inclusive dialogue, a democratic solution that would meet the aspirations of the Ukrainian people.<\/p><p>As the Conclusions state, the Union remains committed to supporting Ukraine&rsquo;s reform course.  While the details have yet to be worked out and agreed,   the EU is ready to further pursue its efforts with the international community and international financial institutions to assist Ukraine, in line with well-established conditions, to find a sustainable way out of its difficult economic situation. <\/p><p>  More generally, the EU has an important role to play in encouraging all sides to end the violence, engage in serious and inclusive dialogue and show willingness to compromise. As High Representative Ashton has already stressed, the EU will act as facilitator and not as a mediator.  I want to take this opportunity to commend the High Representative for her tireless efforts on behalf of the EU and indeed the Ukrainian people. <\/p><p>  I believe that the OSCE and Council of Europe also have potentially important roles to play in facilitating a negotiated way out of the crisis.  Following his visit to Kiev, the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Commissioner for Human Rights has found that excessive force was used against protesters by law enforcement officers and others working with them in recent months.  I have put on record my own shock at the loss of life in Ukraine and that I have been appalled at reports of torture and other severe human rights abuses perpetrated by the security services. I strongly agree with the Commissioner that it is important to prevent any further violence and to ensure accountability for the serious human rights violations which have already occurred.  The Foreign Affairs Council encouraged the Government of Ukraine to appoint without delay its member to the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Advisory Panel which will investigate   the violent incidents during the protests and which could be an effective mechanism in helping to defuse tensions.<\/p><p>  In relation to the particular point raised by the Deputy regarding the Eastern Partnership, I would recall that its purpose is to support reforms in the countries of the EU&rsquo;s Eastern neighbourhood and promote closer political association and economic integration with the EU. This is a long term project and in spite of many challenges, it is important to acknowledge the progress that has already been made in developing the Eastern Partnership. Both Georgia and Moldova will sign Association agreements with the EU later this year. The benefits of the Eastern Partnership are for all the countries of the Eastern Neighbourhood, however, including those which have not chosen, or do not fulfil the conditions, to conclude Association Agreements. The EU will be considering over the next few months how some of the benefits of the Eastern Partnership can be extended to these countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900068#WRA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[8016\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900068#WRA02800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the progress arising from the Geneva two conference on Syria; if he will outline the most recent discussions at the European Union Foreign Affairs Council in relation to these talks; if there has been any recent progress in providing much needed additional humanitarian aid for Syria and neighbouring countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

He will make a full report to the Security Council this week.  I have repeatedly stated that I see no prospect for any military solution to this conflict and that the Geneva principles remain the best basis for a negotiated end to this conflict. If the present opportunity is missed, the future viability of the Syrian state may be at risk.<\/p><p>  The ongoing crisis in Syria and the Geneva II negotiations were discussed at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council which I attended on 10 February. Issues raised included the humanitarian crisis in Syria and across the region and the prospects for a humanitarian resolution at the UN Security Council which I have consistently called for and which now has full EU support; the regional impact of the Syrian conflict; the renewal of the Geneva II negotiations and the chemical weapons destruction programme.  All Member States expressed concerns about the appalling impact of this crisis and a shared determination to support the Geneva II process and Joint Special Representative Brahimi in his efforts.<\/p><p>At the 15 January Syria donor conference in Kuwait, Minister of State Costello met with UN , Valarie Amos, to discuss impediments to the humanitarian efforts on the ground in Syria.  The conflict is Syria is intensifying, with the latest reports indicating a total death toll estimated at 136,000 and over 9.3 million in need of humanitarian assistance.   They agreed that, while reaching populations under siege is an urgent priority, the fact remains that humanitarian access across Syria is exceptionally difficult as a result of increasing disregard by armed groups on both sides of the conflict of their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. <\/p><p>Minister of State Costello pledged a further &euro;12 million in Kuwait.   This additional pledge brings Ireland&rsquo;s overall commitment over the period 2011 to 2014 to &euro;26.011 million.

While this stance has been legally challenged, the New York Supreme Court has ruled that the organisers are permitted to do so as the Parade is a private one.<\/p><p>  Since 2000, a second large parade has taken place in Queens, New York, called that St. Pat&rsquo;s For All Parade.  This inclusive event was set up as a response to the exclusion of LGBT groups from the Fifth Avenue Parade and takes place on the first Sunday in March.   The event is attended by most political and civil leaders in New York City.    The Irish Government has been represented at this event in previous years and that will remain the case this year.<\/p><p>  When I became T&aacute;naiste in 2011, I represented the Government in New York at all the events associated with St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, including the Fifth Avenue parade.    As the St. Pat&rsquo;s For All Event had already taken place at that point, I instead held a meeting with representatives of the Irish LGBT community.    I discussed, at length, the Government&rsquo;s commitment to LGBT rights and my own commitment to see reform in this area.   Ireland works to consistently support the promotion and protection of the human rights of all persons, irrespective of their sexual orientation or gender identity and is strongly committed to combatting all human rights violations committed against individuals on such a basis.  <\/p><p>  The St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day Parade on Fifth Avenue is a major event in the Irish American calendar and is a high point of a whole series of events which take place in New York marking the extraordinary depth of the relationship between the Irish and American peoples.   It is estimated that the parade has over 180,000 participants and between two and three million spectators.     Millions more watch the comprehensive coverage on American television.      In this context, and given the importance of the event for our two nations, the Taoiseach, as last year, will participate in this year&rsquo;s parade.   In keeping with our policy of inclusiveness, the Government will also be represented at the St. Pat&rsquo;s For All Event on 2 March. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900068#WRA03900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Enlargement","counter":52,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900068#WRA03950"},{"type":"question","counter":53,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[8048\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900068#WRA04000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will make representations at EU level to oblige the EU to exert more vigorous pressure on Bosnia's politicians to ensure the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina is respected and insisting that politicians work together to overcome current obstacles to EU integration and obliging them to protect all citizens and their human rights.","asker":"1005","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":54,"content":"<p>The European Union has made clear its unequivocal support for Bosnia and Herzegovina&rsquo;s EU perspective as a sovereign and united country enjoying full territorial integrity.

All are affected by high unemployment, particularly among young people. While they have been hit by the global economic crisis, recovery in the EU should have a positive impact on the region. The European Commission has forecast that the Western Balkans&rsquo; economies should grow by 2% GDP in 2013. This modest recovery is not a guarantee for sustainable growth and convergence, however, and significant challenges remain. The lack of economic growth and job opportunities in some countries has led to public demonstrations recently. <\/p><p>  The EU, as part of its overall support for the region and for the EU perspective of the Western Balkans, is actively supporting their economic growth and reforms.

The EU further encouraged the Government of Sri Lanka to fully cooperate with the UN human rights mechanisms and to allow access for all UN special procedures mandate holders.  <\/p><p>  Ireland, together with our international partners, will continue to take every opportunity, both bilaterally and multilaterally, to urge the Government of Sri Lanka to adhere to its international obligations and respect the human rights of all its citizens, including at the upcoming 25th   Session of the Human Rights Council in March 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900069#WRB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Issues","counter":68,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900069#WRB01050"},{"type":"question","counter":69,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[8117\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900069#WRB01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the details of his discussions at the recent meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers MP, regarding the ongoing political talks in Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[7991\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900069#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on his recent engagements with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers MP; and the discussion that took place regarding the ongoing political talks in Northern Ireland.","asker":"1020","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[8000\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900069#WRB01300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide an update on developments on the Haas proposals; and if the Irish and British Governments are considering intervention to advance progress; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1030","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":72,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 29 and 32 together.<\/p><p>  I met with the Secretary of State most recently on 6 February 2014 to discuss the current political talks and how to take forward the compromise proposals on contentious issues facing Northern Ireland.  <\/p><p>  We agreed that we wish to see the Northern Ireland Parties reach agreement as soon as possible and without further delay.

As the number of fatalities reaches an estimated 130,000 people, there are now over nine million people in need of immediate life-saving support.  More than 6.5 million people are displaced within Syria, and nearly 2.5 million Syrians have fled to take refuge in neighbouring countries. <\/p><p>  It is simply unacceptable that while millions of people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, indiscriminate attacks on civilians and humanitarian personnel continue unabated.  As the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, the challenge of how to reach trapped civilians in urgent need of live-saving assistance remains one of most difficult issues. <\/p><p>  While reaching people under siege is an urgent priority, humanitarian access across the whole country remains exceptionally difficult as a result of increasing disregard by armed groups on all sides of their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. <\/p><p>  Recent events during the agreed ceasefire in Homs, when UN and Syrian Arab Red Crescent humanitarian teams were deliberately targeted as they worked on the evacuation of people who have been besieged, with little aid, for nearly two years, highlighted the conditions under which humanitarian agencies are working and the ongoing threats to the lives of their personnel.  <\/p><p>  Ireland welcomes the extension of the ceasefire in Homs and strongly supports the statement last week by UN Under Secretary General and Emergency Relief Co-ordinator Valerie Amos, calling on Security Council members to use their influence on the parties to ensure they abide by humanitarian pauses and ceasefires, give humanitarian actors regular and sustained access, and commit in writing to uphold humanitarian law, and systematic access across lines.  <\/p><p>  Last month, in Kuwait, at the second international pledging conference for Syria, I pledged a further Irish contribution of &euro;12 million for humanitarian assistance in 2014. This will be disbursed to key UN partners, the Red Cross movement and NGO partners, supporting the provision of life saving humanitarian supplies and essential services such as health, education and protection.  Since the start of the crisis, Ireland has committed to providing more than &euro;26 million for the relief effort in Syria.  We have also provided supplies of non-food items from our emergency relief stocks held in Dubai and specialist emergency personnel under the Rapid Response Initiative.  There has been a huge international effort to provide assistance.  The combined EU pledges in Kuwait amounted to some &euro;550 million.  However, this funding will not have the impact it needs to have if humanitarian agencies continue to be denied access to those in greatest need trapped in areas under siege. <\/p><p>  Ireland has always argued the need to keep the humanitarian issue at the top of the international agenda while understanding that only a political solution can bring the suffering of the Syrian people to an end.  The ongoing talks in Geneva offer the best hope for a permanent end to the conflict and suffering in Syria.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900070#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":98,"content":"<p>Question No. 40 answered with Question No. 21.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":99,"content":"<p>Question No. 41 answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":100,"content":"<p>Question No. 42 answered with Question No. 15.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900070#WRC01050"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[8106\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900070#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will confirm that the proposed Irish consulate in Austin, Texas, will follow the template of other embassies which house representatives of the Industrial Development Agency, Enterprise Ireland and so on and are successfully attracting foreign direct investment particularly from those with a connection to Ireland.

The provisions relating to civil society organisations were part of a wider package of highly restrictive legislative measures passed by the Ukrainian parliament with little or no debate on 16 January.  The laws were hastily passed in the context of the crisis in Ukraine and were rightly seen as an attempt to stifle the protests.<\/p><p>The specific changes to the Law on additional measures (Law 721-VII) required NGOs receiving foreign funding and engaging in broadly defined &ldquo;political activities&rdquo; to register as foreign agents or risk closure. The legislation is similar to earlier Russian legislation concerning &ldquo;foreign agents&rdquo; which the Council of Europe described as having a chilling effect on the NGO community in Russia.<\/p><p>  In an analysis of the Ukrainian measures, the Council of Europe suggested that the aim was not to ensure the financial transparency of NGOs in general but rather to be able to act against NGOs supporting the current protests. The Council of Europe also noted that the label &ldquo;foreign agent&rdquo; is highly derogatory and it is unreasonable to oblige an organisation to assume such a label.<\/p><p>  At its meeting on 20 January, the Foreign Affairs Council expressed deep concern about the legislation as a whole and noted that it would seriously curtail the actions of civil society organisations.  Following a very strong reaction against the new laws, both domestically and internationally, the Ukrainian parliament took the decision on 28 January to cancel the measures.<\/p><p>  At its meeting on 10 February, the Foreign Affairs Council welcomed the decision to revoke the laws while noting that further efforts are necessary to find a durable solution to the current political crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900072#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":144,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 57 and 58 answered with Question No. 23<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900073#WRF00250"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[8575\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900073#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the degree to which the international community has specifically engaged with the opposing factions in Southern Sudan with particular reference to the urgent need to protect the civilian population; if any specific initiatives are being taken in this regard in recent times; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":147,"content":"<p>The East African regional grouping, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), has led mediation efforts between the two parties to the conflict in South Sudan.

Many lessons have been learned from previous crises such as the 2004 tsunami and the 2010 Haiti earthquake.  Under the leadership of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), clear systems have been put in place to ensure the most effective, efficient and rapid delivery of aid possible.  Ireland has been playing our part in ensuring these reforms are implemented, so that responses are timely and effective, and meet the most critical, immediate needs. <\/p><p>  Two months after the January 2010 Haiti earthquake, an international donor conference was held in New York, at which US $4.5 billion worth of assistance over two years was pledged by the international community in response to the crisis.  UN figures indicate that, by the end of 2012, just $2.38 billion of this had actually been disbursed.  For our part, we worked hard to meet Ireland&rsquo;s commitments to the people of Haiti.  By the end of 2012, our pledge of &euro;13 million had been honoured and exceeded, with support totalling almost &euro;14 million. <\/p><p>  At the UN in New York in September 2011, the T&aacute;naiste pledged that &euro;10 million in humanitarian assistance would be made available to help the poorest and most vulnerable in the Horn of Africa before the end of 2012.  I am happy to report that this pledge has also been met, with almost &euro;12 million in funding provided by December 2012.  Similarly, at the High-Level International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria in January 2013, I announced a commitment of &euro;4.7 million to support the provision of humanitarian assistance in Syria and neighbouring countries. By the end of 2013, this pledge had been exceeded by over &euro;6.5 million, with a total of &euro;11.3 million in assistance provided throughout the course of the year. Ireland can be very proud of our record on delivery of our pledges.<\/p><p>  Even though no official pledging conference took place in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan which struck the Philippines in November 2014, according to the UN&rsquo;s Financial Tracking Service, as of 14 February 2014 over US$660 million has been contributed to the response by the international community and a further US$377 million has been pledged but not yet committed. <\/p><p>  Ireland was one of the first countries to respond to this natural disaster and our contribution to date stands at over &euro;4 million.  The Government also authorised the deployment of a technical mission to explore ways in which Ireland can most effectively contribute to the recovery process.  Further financial assistance in 2014 will be considered on the basis of the recommendations of this technical team&rsquo;s report.<\/p><p>  In order to promote the importance of ensuring that donor aid pledges are credible, achievable, and properly monitored, the OECD has published a &lsquo;Recommendation on Good Pledging Practice&rsquo;.  This comprises a set of principles relating to pledging practice for financial undertakings to developing countries and is designed to serve as a benchmark to help OECD Member States frame future aid pledges in terms that are clear, practical, realistic, and capable of being monitored.  Ireland strongly supports this OECD initiative and will continue to use all appropriate fora to urge our fellow donors to ensure that they meet their humanitarian commitments in full.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900073#WRF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":156,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 64 and 65 answered with Question No. 18.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":158,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900074#WRG00250"},{"type":"question","counter":159,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[8582\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900074#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the estimated death toll in respect of the civilian populations at the top ten conflict locations worldwide in the past five years; the extent to which such facts continue to be used by the international community to bring about a replacement of violence by constructive dialogue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":160,"content":"<p>There is no general agreement on which of the world&rsquo;s many conflicts would constitute the top ten and accordingly it is not possible to produce the figures requested by the Deputy in regard to the estimated death toll in respect of the civilian populations over the past five years.<\/p><p>  Considerable ongoing efforts are being made by the international community, in which Ireland is actively engaged, to resolve, and where possible prevent, conflicts, using the available instruments to foster constructive dialogue and encourage peaceful, negotiated solutions to political differences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900074#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Policy","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900074#WRG00450"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[8583\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900074#WRG00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which, in the course of the ongoing foreign policy review, it is intended to have special regard for new trade opportunities; if consular or other diplomatic appointments are likely to remain a feature of the need for establishment of new markets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

All proposals for funding are rigorously appraised by Irish Aid staff using clear criteria, including quality of intended impact, sustainability, cost effectiveness and efficiency in the use of all resources, including administration costs.   The programmes are subject to regular internal and external monitoring and are evaluated and audited by independent experts, as well as by my Department&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit.  <\/p><p>  To ensure that our assistance is targeted at those most in need and delivered in the most effective manner we work through a variety of bilateral and other aid delivery channels in partnership with national Governments, local communities, NGOs, and key multilateral partners such as the United Nations. Each of these partners is fully accountable to my Department for all funds received, including those spent on eligible administration costs. <\/p><p>  In line with best practice and with recommendations from the OECD for improving the accountability of all development financing, Ireland strongly supports the strengthening of partner country capacity and delivery systems.  We provide assistance to national Government oversight institutions, such as the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committees of national Parliaments, to ensure Governments are held to account for the effective expenditure of public funds, including overseas development assistance.  Our management and oversight systems are continually under review to ensure that Irish development funding goes to those most in need, and that we meet the highest standards of accountability.  <\/p><p>  Providing quality assistance is also about ensuring that we use our aid to strengthen country capacity to deliver sustainable social and economic development. Poverty in many countries is extensive and we know that development assistance alone cannot address all needs.  To achieve a sustainable solution to poverty, countries need to generate their own revenues through increased economic activity based on equitable economic growth, improved employment and better trading opportunities.<\/p><p>  The approach of leveraging aid for trade is recognised as an effective component of international development.

As the Deputy is aware, High Representative Catherine Ashton and Commissioner Stefan F&uuml;le issued a joint statement in response to the Court&rsquo;s judgment, which urged the Ukrainian authorities to reconsider Ms Tymoshenko&rsquo;s imprisonment and to implement fully all rulings of the ECHR. My full support for this statement is already on record. <\/p><p>  The EU&rsquo;s position is as set out in the Conclusions of the 10 December 2012 Foreign Affairs Council and in the joint statement of the EU-Ukraine Summit of 25 February 2013: that Ukraine must address convincingly three key areas including the issue of selective justice.  A positive step on Ms Tymoshenko&rsquo;s imprisonment would be extremely helpful and send a powerful signal in that regard. <\/p><p>  The European Parliament&rsquo;s monitoring mission to Ukraine, which was led by the former President of Poland, Aleksander Kwa&oelig;niewski, and the former President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, engaged actively with the Ukrainian authorities on the issue of selective justice in Ukraine, including Ms Tymoshenko&rsquo;s case.

Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world. We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official channels and non-governmental\/civil society organisations. Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015.  <\/p><p>  We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.  This includes support for the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedure Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. The EU regularly makes statements at these bodies on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.<\/p><p>  Since March 2006, when the UN Human Rights Council was formed, Ireland has engaged proactively with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism initiated by the Council. The UPR mechanism allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 193 UN Member States approximately every four and a half years, based on human rights obligations under UN human rights and other instruments. Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue (i.e. the actual examination of the State under review) and submit written questions in advance. Ireland was itself examined under the UPR process on 6 October 2011. The process enables UN Member States to raise issues, some of which would have been identified by members of the public and civil society, and to make recommendations about the protection and promotion of human rights in the State concerned.  Ireland has engaged fully with the UPR process and welcomes the open and constructive dialogue associated with it. We have also made numerous interventions during the UPR examination of other states, raising issues of concern such as gender-based violence, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly and the protection of human rights defenders within the State under review.<\/p><p>  The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law.  In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.  In June 2012 the EU adopted a Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.<\/p><p>  Ireland and its EU partners have been strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.<\/p><p>  Ireland has also consistently taken the lead in negotiating resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly and in the Human Rights Council on the promotion and protection of human rights defenders, as well as on the implementation of EU Guidelines in relation to human rights defenders in third countries, the aim being to ensure that the latter can operate in an environment free from hindrance and insecurity.<\/p><p>  Mindful that the risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, the Government&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, Irish Aid, supports concrete actions designed to promote human rights, including strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions (in particular through legal training). Legal aid programmes targeted at victims of human rights abuses are also supported.

Two further rounds of negotiations took place in November and December 2013 while the fourth round of negotiations is scheduled to take place in Brussels during week commencing 10 March 2014.  Because of the huge potential importance of the Partnership to the transatlantic economy and the extent of preparatory work undertaken before launching the process, negotiations are taking place at a relatively fast pace.  A political stocktaking meeting between the principal negotiators, Commissioner Karel de Gucht and United States Trade Representative Mr. Michael Froman, took place on 17 and 18  February. This meeting looked at all issues across the negotiating agenda and discussed the best means to keep the negotiations moving forward with the pace and energy that both sides have demonstrated to date.    <\/p><p>  The negotiations with the United States are aimed at eliminating tariffs, improving market access to the EU and U.S. markets for both parties by agreements on trade in services and investment, improving opportunities for businesses to win contracts in the extensive public procurement markets on both sides and enhancing regulatory co-operation, coherence and development to ensure existing high quality regulations are maintained but the regulatory burden on business is eased where possible. <\/p><p>  Impact assessment studies undertaken by the EU Commission suggest that as much as 80% of the long term gains from the TTIP will be achieved by changes to regulatory practices, such as the range of technical standards that apply to products sold in both the EU and the US.  As most of the potential gains from TTIP will arise from regulatory convergence and mutual recognition of each parties regulatory regimes, companies and especially SME&rsquo;s will benefit from lower regulatory compliance costs. All of this will provide significant opportunities for Irish businesses to increase their access to the US market and at lower costs, as well as reducing the costs of goods that companies here buy from the US as part of their global supply chains \/ manufacturing activity or as goods for consumer use.   <\/p><p>  The EU and the US already have very strong trading and investment ties. The conclusion of a Trade and Investment Agreement with the US would have a significant and positive impact on trade, resulting in new markets for Irish exporters and bringing positive effects on job creation and competitiveness. A comprehensive deal on areas such as common regulatory standards and investment rules holds massive potential for economic growth and jobs which it is estimated could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum and help create approximately 400,000 jobs in the EU. The scale of benefits can be judged from estimates that the agreement could boost the EU economy by &euro;120 billion, that of the US by &euro;90billion and that of the rest of the world by &euro;100 billion.<\/p><p>  From the outset my Department has encouraged the Commission to seek the most ambitious programme of tariff reductions possible. This is because of the impact on both the costs of doing business in Ireland and the wider competitiveness and consumer benefits. While current tariffs are already low on trade, even low tariffs can act as a tax on trade that in reality serves little or no purpose. <\/p><p>  At the same time we are seeking progress on deeper and more intense co-operation among regulators so that the onerous costs business face in duplicative regulatory compliance work on both sides of the Atlantic can be minimised or removed. The agreement will not bring about regulatory change which would lower the high quality standards our citizens and consumers have come to expect from the EU. I am committed to having a regulatory regime that ensures the most effective application and protection for EU citizens. Both I and other EU Ministers made this clear during negotiations last June on the Council&rsquo;s negotiating mandate to the Commission on TTIP. <\/p><p>  It also has to be acknowledged that because of the scale and importance of this agreement, a number of confidence building measures on both sides were linked to getting the talks underway last year. One of these was the lifting of the US ban on imports of Irish beef, again an area that I spoke to the Commissioner about on a number of occasions. I am pleased that the US has published proposals to open its market to Irish beef exports and that work is advancing on the essential veterinarian procedures to be agreed to enable trade to start. However, I would not be supportive of radical changes that would disproportionately affect the sensitive agriculture sectors of the EU economy and I have made these points directly and personally to the Commissioner.<\/p><p>  In addition to coordinating the interests of other Departments, enterprise development agencies and business associations, to promote our strategic interests as the TTIP negotiations develop, my Department recently engaged international expertise to examine the economic and other impacts TTIP and related potential opportunities. The focus of this study will be to identify key areas and sectors of the economy that will be impacted by the TTIP. This work will help to inform our input to the Commission&rsquo;s negotiating position and to identify appropriate policy responses to be deployed to maximise the potential of this historic agreement and provide an assessment of the longer term implications for enterprise policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900080#WRN01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":298,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900081#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[8515\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900081#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if there any indications from the Industrial Development Agency or Enterprise Ireland of job investments in the Arklow\/south Wicklow area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

IDA Ireland has strong relationships with these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.

This involves working with both existing clients and new companies on a one to one confidential basis and on a group basis to help them grow internationally.<\/p><p>  There are many complex factors influencing investor location decision-making such as the increasing preference of investors globally for cities of scale with 1 million plus population, significant challenges from lower cost locations in the UK and Eastern Europe and attractive regional aid.<\/p><p>  In order to address the lack of investment in certain regional locations, I have requested IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to work with my Department so that we can explore what further initiatives we can take to ensure we have a better approach to enterprise development in regional locations. This exercise will complement the in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy which is currently being undertaken. This analysis, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, the changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that will be introduced in 2014 and our approach to regional development will inform the formulation of an appropriate FDI strategy from 2015 onwards.<\/p><p>  Last year the Department of Finance produced improved employment forecasts for 2014.

The 2014 Action Plan for jobs is due to be published shortly.  This year&rsquo;s Plan will build on the success of 2012 and 2013 and will once again set out a series of ambitious commitments on the part of the Government to support job creation and retention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900081#WRO00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights Issues","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900081#WRO00350"},{"type":"question","counter":302,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[8599\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021900081#WRO00400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will make contact with the management of a bar (details supplied) in County Galway to ensure that the workers who have lost their jobs without notice, receive wages, wages in lieu or holiday pay that is due to them.

For example, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on the arrangements for local authority financing. In addition, under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, the Minister for Finance, from 2014 onwards, is to pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this will contribute to a range of financial supports being provided to local authorities, including General Purpose Grants and funding, on the basis of Service Level Agreements, for water services which local authorities will be providing on behalf of Irish Water. <\/p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised. Given the significant changes to local government financing already taking place in 2014, as outlined above, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015. This approach allows maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax proceeds in 2014, particularly in terms of General Purpose Grants, with a priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases. <\/p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.<\/p><p>  The implications of local retention of Local Property Tax are being considered in the context of preparations for the budgetary process for 2015.

These requirements flow directly from the requirement for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact established under the Maastricht Treaty, and the associated limitation on budget deficits.  The local government sector must not impact negatively on the General Government Balance (GGB) in any one year.  In order to stay within the overall GGB limit, it is necessary for local authorities to maintain both their current and capital accounts broadly in balance. The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income equals capital expenditure in the year.  Balance is only required at an overall level and this allows considerable scope for authorities to draw on their existing capital reserves as an element of their overall investment programme.  The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s <i>Action Programme for Effective Local Government<\/i> sets out Government policy decisions in relation to a range of local government reform measures including a more effective, coherent and comprehensive system of sub-county municipal governance, encompassing both urban and rural areas, to strengthen local government within counties and address weaknesses and anomalies in the current system.  The Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides the legislative basis for the structural reforms set out in the Action Programme.  The Act provides that the local authority for a county will become the successor authority, for all purposes, of each town council in the county.  Section 13 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides that any moneys accruing to a housing authority from the sale of dwellings to tenants, etc., shall be placed in a separate account and, with the Minister&rsquo;s approval, may be used for the provision of housing or for the refurbishment or maintenance of existing housing, or any other related purposes.  Responsibility for this account and other assets of town councils will rest with the successor authority in each case.

In particular, the Programme proposes to change the way care is delivered to people with Type 2 Diabetes and to support a National Model of Integrated Care.  The Model, which is evidence based and clinically acceptable, is the result of an extensive consultation process and agreed by the relevant stakeholders.  The aim is to facilitate the structured care of patients with uncomplicated Type 2 Diabetes in the Primary Care setting only while patients with complicated Type 2 Diabetes will be managed by primary and secondary care services.<\/p><p>  The Diabetic Retinopathy screening and treatment initiative commenced in 2013 and was successful in inviting 30% of registered patients with diabetes for screening, as planned.  In 2014, it is proposed to screen the remaining 70% of the diabetic population, as set out in the HSE's National Service Plan 2014.  This screening is being carried out through the National Cancer Control Programme Office.<\/p><p>  A National Model of Care for Type 2 Diabetes has been developed with the joint involvement of health care providers in primary, secondary and tertiary care sectors.  The focus of the Model is the concept of &quot;Integrated Care&quot;, where all health care providers come together to communicate effectively and coherently to manage a person with Type 2 Diabetes.<\/p><p>  In summary, the Model recommends that:<\/p><p>  - People with uncomplicated Type 2 Diabetes will be under the governance of their General Practitioner (GP), with the support of a multidisciplinary community based team and have a clearly defined pathway of care, and will be seen three times a year in a primary care setting.<\/p><p>  - People with complicated Type 2 Diabetes will be under the governance of both their GP and a consultant endocrinologist in a secondary or tertiary care setting.<\/p><p>  - People with Type 1 Diabetes or complex genetic or secondary causes of diabetes will have their diabetes related care under the governance of the consultant-led diabetes multidisciplinary team in a secondary or tertiary care setting.<\/p><p>  As part of the phased roll out of the National Integrated Care Diabetes Programme and to support the Model of Care, the Government approved funding for the appointment of 17 Integrated Care Diabetes Nurse Specialists (one per HSE Integrated Service Area).  These Diabetes Nurse Specialists will play a key role in the development of clinically sound collaborative links between primary care and secondary care providers and will also be an essential resource in empowering patients to achieve optimum diabetes control.
