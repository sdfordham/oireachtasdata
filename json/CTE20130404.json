This has allowed me to pull together my full team, which has been rather stretched with servicing meetings throughout Europe during the past three months.  It is much appreciated that we can fit the meeting into this timescale.<\/p><p>  The proposal before the committee and under discussion today is a proposal establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms and amending various Council directives and regulations.  The Commission's proposal for the recovery and resolution of financial institutions in difficulty was published in June 2012.  It seeks to establish a standard framework for dealing with the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms in Europe and will provide member states with a common set of tools and powers to resolve institutions in difficulty.  The overriding objective is to ensure that a bank's critical functions can be maintained while the costs of restructuring and resolving banks fall on the banks' owners and creditors rather than on taxpayers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013040400002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Carrigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1365085200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carrigan for his very comprehensive briefing.

There are high-street banks in which one lodges one's salary at the end of the month and from which one obtains a mortgage or business account and there are investment houses through which major construction and development projects would have been financed.  The two have different risk profiles.  With regard to the restructuring of the banks, which is what this process is very much about, how much has the Irish banking system been examined with this in mind?

Each of the reports has come up with slightly varying solutions.  The United Kingdom is focusing more on structural separation.  The Liikanen report examines the idea of making provision for different capital requirements depending on the risks of the various elements of the institution.  All of these approaches are being considered by the European Commission.  It is the intention of the European Commission, in the summer or shortly thereafter, to bring forward a specific proposal for legislation to deal with the structural issues associated with large financial institutions.  It is not clear as yet whether the European Commission will opt for complete structural separation or different treatments within existing structures.  There are consultation groups examining the matter.  It is not clear yet what elements will need to be separated.

The preventative measures - such as the resolution and recovery plans, and early intervention - must be shown not to have worked before any of the resolution tools can be used by the resolution authorities.  At that stage, where the capital or financial position of the bank is such that it has failed or is likely to fail, and there is a public interest, the resolution authority can use one or other of these tools.<\/p><p>  Conceptually, the bail-in tool itself is as follows.  A valuation would be undertaken to determine the value of the assets and the gap between the assets and liabilities, including equity.  That gap would first be applied to shareholders and then to the subordinated capital.  Where that is insufficient to cover the losses, other creditors would be subject to a haircut so that the assets and liabilities match.  In certain circumstances, there is a further process whereby certain creditors would be further written down but compensated with new equity issued to recapitalise the bank, so that it can operate on the basis of going forward.<\/p><p>  The process is stating the losses that the bank has experienced and passing those losses to the bank's owners and creditors according to the insolvency hierarchy rather than allowing the losses to be picked up by taxpayers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013040400006#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Dempsey"},{"type":"speech","time":1365085800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I would like to welcome Mr. Carrigan and his colleagues from the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.

He also said that only after these had been exhausted could senior creditors be written down.

As my question is somewhat political I do not know how he will respond.  In recent weeks Ministers have given categorical assurances that the way in which events were resolved in Cyprus will never be contemplated by this Government.  They stated that it will not and cannot happen.  Is Mr. Carrigan surprised that Ministers would take such a position given that the negotiations have not reached a conclusion?  It is at least possible that the finalised directive or some future legislative proposal resulting from it could require a bail-in of depositors above or below a certain threshold as part of a harmonised set of tools.

The structures of the banking systems are dissimilar.  Cyprus was a deposit-funded banking system.  We have a different structure for funding our banking system.  Furthermore, we have already experienced our banking crisis and our banks are fully recapitalised at this stage and the system of banking supervision has improved immensely.  A considerable number of steps have been taken from the position in which we found ourselves several years ago.  There is no comparison between Ireland and Cyprus and the Minister made that clear.  Furthermore, he stated there is no question but that guaranteed deposits are guaranteed.  The issue in Cyprus arose out of a decision by the Cypriot Government in its own right to impose a levy on deposits.  Taxation is a matter for individual member states and Cyprus made that proposal.  It was an unfortunate proposal and the Government indicated that it did not favour it as a solution for deposits under &euro;100,000, which are guaranteed.  There is no question regarding the guaranteed deposits.<\/p><p>  As my colleague from the Central Bank has made clear, even under the existing legislation there is no absolute guarantee for deposits in an insolvent institution.  As part of the resolution of an insolvent institution, issues arising from the current legislation, which has been in place for some time, have to be addressed.  The measures now being putting in place will ensure such a situation does not arise.  Recovery and resolution plans will be brought forward and there will be early intervention measures.

The purpose here is the overall framework, which involves a prevention phase and a preparatory phase.  The individual institutions and the resolution authorities will be required to draw up recovery and resolution plans.  They will have to do that at the level of the institution.  That will identify the various risks and how those risks are to be addressed.  There are a number of early warning lights which should arise if the system is properly structured, supervised and enacted at the levels of the institution and of the supervisor and the resolution authority.  There is also the ability to intervene.  The resolution authority, in consultation with the supervisory authorities, can take a number of actions to intervene in a bank which looks as though it is beginning to enter into difficulties.  They can be of a fairly active nature and can include the appointment of a special manager.  It is only if the institution is failing, or is likely to fail, that one is into more stronger powers of interaction.  What one should have with this framework in place is an architecture which allows interventions to take place.<\/p><p>  As Mr. Carrigan and colleagues in the Central Bank of Ireland have said, it is not just on this pillar that the overall safeguards rest.  Stronger capital requirements will be put in place between 2014 and 2020 when the full effect of the capital requirements directive is in place.  Ongoing stress testing is taking place and is being overseen by the EBA.  That will also be monitored.  There are more robust powers in the Central Bank of Ireland, which have been put in place through legislative processes, and there is better and more recruitment and more active engagement with the individual institutions.  Taken together, one has an overall framework which should allow more effective monitoring of risks.  The issue is how those risks are addressed by the different actors at the level of the institution and that of the supervisory authorities in the bank and elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013040400010#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Casey"},{"type":"speech","time":1365088200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>The design fault in the original euro was that it did not protect small countries from massive capital flows from large countries, which did not mean much to the large countries because, by definition, they are large countries.
