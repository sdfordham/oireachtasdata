To summarise actions taken to date, I requested a report from the Central Bank on the topic, which was published in May.  I also met with the six main mortgage lenders and outlined my view that the interest rates being charged to Irish customers were too high.<\/p>  <p>  I have recently concluded a further series of meetings with these banks and the reality is that the majority have put options in place to allow borrowers to reduce their monthly repayments.  Traditionally borrowers focused on standard variable rates but borrowers should at least consider other options.  While individual borrowers must decide what suits their particular circumstances, some of the fixed rates being offered are now substantially below what the standard variable rate, SVR, was in May.  These rates offer substantial savings to borrowers and also offer security as to monthly repayments over a specific period of time.  At the end of that term, borrowers can then revert to a standard variable rate if that is what they prefer.  I would, therefore, encourage borrowers to contact their bank to see what is available to them in their particular circumstances or consider moving to another bank if the offer is not satisfactory.<\/p>  <p>  I would also point out that lenders have not just reduced fixed rates.  One lender significantly reduced its SVR, for example, while another has embarked on a new pricing strategy based on property valuation.  I asked the banks to provide options by which customers might reduce their monthly repayments and I believe options have been put in place.<\/p>  <p>  While I have not met all mortgage providers operating in Ireland, changes to interest rates by the main lenders should drive competition in the market and exert downward pressure on other lenders to reduce their rates in line with other providers.  Sub-prime lenders operate in a particular niche and deal with customers who present a different risk profile to other customers, hence their rates will be higher other lenders.<\/p>  <p>  Competition is the best long-term way of reducing interest rates paid by Irish borrowers and ensuring that Irish banks offer a sustainable product range.  Higher than warranted mortgage interest rates will encourage new entrants to the Irish market over the long term.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has undertaken a number of initiatives in order to promote competition in the market.  For example, it introduced the changes to section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 for new entrants.  This section regulates fees and charges and the changes mean that it does not apply for the first three years of operation of new entrants to the Irish banking sector as new entrants to the mortgage market bring welcome competition to this sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900004#B00100","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1443531900,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Several banks have introduced new options, which are always a good thing, but these options are very selective.  They are of most benefit to new customers in particular.  Many existing customers continue to be discriminated against and the options simply are not for everyone.<\/p>  <p>  The following are the actual standard variable rates still being charged by the banks today: Bank of Ireland, 4.5%; Permanent TSB, 4.3%; KBC 4.5%. or 4.3% if the customer opens a current account with it; Ulster Bank, 4.3%; AIB, 3.65%; ACC, 4.4%; and Danske Bank, 4.95%.

He will recall that the Central Bank report published last May, to which I referred, stated that there was an excessive margin being charged in Ireland on variable interest rates but it disagreed that the margin was as big as has been cited in debates here on several occasions.  The banks have moved to lower that particular margin.  AIB has had made three reductions and it is the biggest mortgage provider in the country.  It is down to 3.65% and it does not vary between new mortgages and existing ones.  Permanent TSB has moved from its variable standard rate to what it describes as a managed variable rate and has introduced the concept of loan to value.<\/p><p>In the best loan-to-value situations they are offering money at 3.6%, I believe, and then it varies with loan-to-value rates, so there is significant movement.  There are dozens of interest rates being offered now in different circumstances and I wish to see how the market operates and if competition will kick in.  There is a reluctance among people to change.  There is a type of inertia which is leading to individuals staying with their existing mortgage holders, but there is much better value if people shop around.  It is not something one must fix for life - one will not get that option anyway.  Normally, one fixes for one, two or three years and people can then revert to standard variable rates.  At the conclusion of my meetings with the banks I said that if we are all around, we will talk again early in the new year and we will see how competition is operating.<\/p> <p> On the question of the levy, there has been a levy in place over the last number of budgets.

Yes, there have been improvements in the product offering, the fixed rates have come down and the managed variable rates are an innovation, but for many customers who are in negative equity or have very little equity and are really struggling there is little or no improvement.  I have outlined all the variable rates still being charged by banks.  Many of them are still up around the 4% to 4.5% rate and they are even higher in some cases.  That is excessive when one considers the very low cost of funds that the banks are facing at present, the price that consumers must pay by entering into a fixed rate, the loss of flexibility they encounter when they do that and the fact that existing customers are being discriminated against.  When the Minister says that if he is still here he will meet the banks again in the new year, it sounds as if the threat of the levy being increased or of legislation being introduced to give more powers to the Central Bank appears to be off the table.

My officials also provided these documents to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Brown Rudnick letter suggested a semi-exclusive sales process which considered a number of suggestions regarding the future management of the portfolio for the Minister, Mr. Wilson, to consider.  This would not typically be a cause for concern.  A buyer will often seek a closed or exclusive sales process because it is in their interest to remove competition and increase their chances of success.  Therefore, while it may be somewhat naive to suggest such an approach to NAMA, it is not surprising and gave me no cause for concern, as I was aware NAMA would favour conducting an open market process for any sale process.<\/p> <p> In my reply to the Minister, Mr. Wilson, on 25 July 2013, I advised that Brown Rudnick should approach NAMA directly with its expression of interest and clarified that NAMA would not run an exclusive process but would have to run a competitive and transparent sales process.  At that time, I also referred the letter I had received to NAMA for its information.  NAMA subsequently received a third party approach on behalf of PIMCO to sell the loan portfolio on an exclusive basis in September 2013.  Following this expression of interest, NAMA, in line with its well-established policy on asset and loan sales, instigated a competitive market sales process in February 2014.  NAMA appointed Lazard, a major international investment bank, in January 2014 to advise on and oversee the sales process for Project Eagle.  Based on its assessment of the market, Lazard invited eight other major global investment groups, alongside PIMCO, to participate in the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900005#C01200","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443533100,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.

As the Governor of the Central Bank said, in most advanced economies, including Ireland, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive to ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis.  Such control would strongly discourage new entrants.  The Central Bank has not sought any power to regulate interest rates and I have made it clear that I would be willing to consider such regulation if the Central Bank requested it.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>My Department and I exerted pressure on lenders by calling them in to discuss the issue twice and by reviewing the possibility of regulating interest rates or imposing a levy on the banks.  Our opinion is that regulation would have negative consequences for customers in the long run and this position is supported by Central Bank and ESRI research.  Competition represents the best long term solution to the problem.  The Government made a commitment in the statement of Government priorities 2014 to 2016 to applying downward pressure on mortgage rates by increasing and supporting competition in the market and it will continue to work to fulfil that commitment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900007#E00700","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443534300,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Aside from unemployment, would the Minister accept that mortgage arrears are the single biggest issue facing Irish homes today?

The banks were severely damaged institutions and had great difficulties with their customers.  We have been working our way through this ever since.  We are now in a position in which we have viable banks trading again and providing the kinds of credit lines we need to keep an economy growing at a rate of 5%.  Mortgage interest and mortgage provision are part of that.  People need houses and have to have mortgages to purchase them.  The interest rates are higher than in the rest of Europe.  It is arguable what the margin actually is, but much of the additional margin is due to the first statement of the Deputy, the fact that there are so many mortgages in arrears.

As she is aware, I had initiated a review of the operation of the local property tax, LPT, earlier this year.  The review was carried out by Dr. Don Thornhill, who chaired the interdepartmental group on the design of a local property tax in 2012.  While Dr. Thornhill's current review focused mainly on property price developments, it\u00a0also considered and made recommendations on a limited number of other issues relating to the efficient and effective operation of LPT.  I considered it appropriate that Dr. Thornhill's review included the operation of the pyrite exemption for local property tax.<\/p>  <p>  It was made clear during the passage of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act in 2013 that the exemption would be restricted to properties with significant pyritic damage and that not all damaged properties could avail of the exemption.  Regulations made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in relation to testing, certification and the NSAI protocol were published in May 2013 and these restricted the LPT exemption to properties with significant pyritic damage where such damage had been proven by the appropriate testing and subsequently certified.<\/p>  <p>  Before its establishment, it would have been envisaged that the Pyrite Remediation Board, PRB, would have remediated those properties that would have qualified for a LPT exemption and that the requirement to have the level of pyrite damage verified and certified would be a precondition for remediation.  However, it transpired that only properties with a damage condition rating of 2 are being accepted for remediation by the PRB.  Also, I understand the PRB is not testing and certifying all properties that are being remediated.  That gives rise to two issues - first, properties with a damage condition rating of 1, with progression, are not being accepted for remediation by the PRB and, second, not all properties that are accepted for remediation are tested and certified.  A property owner who might have only a damage condition rating of 1, or 1, with progression, established by a second test, and who wants to claim the LPT exemption, has to spend &euro;1,500 to &euro;2,000 on testing and certification.  Properties with a damage condition rating of 2 are accepted for remediation but are not eligible for the LPT exemption unless they have the required certificate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900013#L00300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1443537000,"counter":79,"content":"<p>With respect, there is nothing new in the Minister's response.

The Minister is on the record of the D&aacute;il as saying that was never envisaged but he is almost on the record almost a year ago as saying that he had instructed his officials to deal with the matter, he was examining all the options and he expected an early resolution.  The reality is the State is remediating properties, probably at a cost of approximately &euro;40,000 per house because it accepts those properties have pyrite, even though an infill test was not done, but the other arm of the State, namely, Revenue, expects those very same people to get a test done at a cost to them of approximately &euro;2,000 to get an exemption of perhaps &euro;400 or &euro;500 over the course of three years.

For that reason, it is not in a position to provide any additional information in respect of these enforcement investigations at this time.<\/p>  <p>  I also understand the Central Bank is examining several lender-specific practices, particularly with regard to transparency of disclosure for borrowers.  The determination of the most effective and appropriate further supervisory engagement will be informed by the outcome of this current supervisory work, as well as any other market intelligence, including its engagement with the Financial Services Ombudsman.  If the Deputy\u00a0is aware of other banks that have behaved in similar ways, leading to failures similar to that of Permanent TSB, he should bring them to the attention of the Central Bank.  Although it does not investigate individual consumer complaints, it does welcome information from consumers of financial products.  Individual customers can complain to the Financial Services Ombudsman if they are unable to resolve a complaint satisfactorily with their financial services provider.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is an independent institution and I do not have a role in directing its enforcement or investigative activities, nor does it report to me on specific investigations it undertakes.  That said, the Government expects the Central Bank to use the powers available to it and to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure all customers are protected, whether this involves formal investigations or other means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900017#P00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1443539100,"counter":110,"content":"<p>As the Minister knows in the case of Permanent TSB, it lost a High Court case on this matter and had findings made against it by the Financial Services Ombudsman.  However, it still took it to the steps of the Supreme Court before, under duress from the Central Bank because of an enforcement investigation, it bowed to the inevitable, put its hands up and acknowledged up to 1,400 customers had been mistreated, denied a tracker mortgage rate after coming off a fixed-rate or given the wrong information about their entitlement to a tracker rate.  That is a serious matter.  At least 22 families lost their homes directly because of the overcharging by the bank.  They are now in the process of going through a compensation scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe the matter ends there, however.  It was reported in the Sunday newspapers that AIB has reinstated tracker mortgage rates to certain customers who were wrongly denied the rate after coming off a fixed-rate mortgage for some time and that some customers have had a write-down of their mortgages because of this issue.  Action needs to be taken on this.  There must be a system-wide review by the Central Bank across the banking system as to how customers, entitled to return to a tracker rate having come off a fixed rate, were treated.  The six-year limitations rule for complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman means many customers who should have been entitled to go back on a tracker rate in 2009 and 2010 will have the window for recourse to the Ombudsman shut in their faces shortly.

There was a modest increase in the health budget last year despite the fact that new beds were opened and &euro;70 million extra was allocated but it did not deal completely with the situation in so far as waiting lists were concerned.

It is a warning from the Minister for Health that he is not content to have a situation in which year after year a budget is agreed and that, year after year, it is not met.  It is not possible to meet it in all circumstances.

As Deputy McDonald is aware, there are numbers of components to this.  There is the social housing element, the renovation of units or apartments that are void at present and the private housing sector.  Believe me, it is not a shortage of money that has caused the exacerbation here.  It is not fit to have children and families in bed and breakfast accommodation or to have children homeless or staying in hotel rooms.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, when the homeless situation became very public from September to Christmas, the Government responded very strongly in respect of the rough sleepers who were homeless, through the acquisition of new accommodation and providing money for extra accommodation, night caf&eacute;s and constant engagement with people who were sleeping rough on the streets.  At the end of that saga, in January and February, there was a bed for everybody who wanted one.  Now, it has broadened far more because of the situation where landlords are concerned and people not being in a position to pay rent.  The rent supplement scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection is available for any person who is having difficulty with a landlord at present where rent is being increased and who are likely to have uncertainty about being able to stay in their home.  A total of 4,000 individual cases have been helped under this scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I note the Deputy's comment about the capital programme today, in which she indicated that it appeared as if the Government is reducing the amount of money being made available for social housing.  In fact, the programme extends out to the budget of October 2020, which will be for the year 2021, and an extra &euro;500 million is allocated there.  I bring that to her attention for her information.  It is not being shortened, but is being extended and broadened.<\/p>  <p>  What will happen this evening for people who are homeless and on the streets?  It is a very difficult situation and is not satisfactory.  However, we cannot and will not be able to deal with it until we provide more houses on the ground.  This morning the Cabinet agreed to the Minister's proposition for modular housing and to move immediately with 150.  The Deputy might have seen and visited these units.  They are in different shapes and forms.  They are very acceptable and are guaranteed for insulation, warmth and comfort.  They are also for families, so they are not in bed and breakfast accommodation or hotel rooms.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government have met and engaged on a range of opportunities that will help us to move this forward and to provide more houses.  The Minister for Finance has referred to the opportunities that might exist with NAMA's land bank and the possibility of more housing there.<\/p>  <p>  No matter what happens, however, we cannot deal with the situation effectively until one starts to put blocks and concrete on the ground.  We hope to start on that very strongly in the time ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900019#R00500","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1443540300,"counter":159,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach must have been off looking for water on Mars for the last four years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900019#R00600","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1443540300,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Settle down, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900019#R00700","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1443540300,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Are we for real here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900019#R00800","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1443540300,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Deputy, your party spokesperson is due to ask questions, so do not interfere with Deputy McDonald in the meantime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900019#R00900","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1443540300,"counter":163,"content":"<p>The sum total is that the Taoiseach has no answer for families who will seek emergency accommodation tonight and will be sent away.

There are 130,000 households on the housing waiting list.

The Taoiseach, I and all of the families on the waiting list know that.<\/p>  <p>  It is curious to hear the Taoiseach say that it is not a matter of funding and that money is not the issue.  The facts do not bear that out.  It appears that the Taoiseach lays the blame for this crisis at the feet of almost everybody.  The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, blames the local authorities, the T&aacute;naiste has blamed the planning process and, at times, it almost appears as if homeless people and families are being blamed.  The Government's record is that it cut the social housing budgets in its first years in office.  It has not released the funding for local authorities to build the homes so desperately needed, despite the fact that there are shovel ready projects good to go since 2013.  The fact is that the Government fails to fund appropriate and sufficient emergency accommodation.

At European level and at the level of leaders all of this terminology gets thrown around.  Of course we must be more competitive, but there are different ways of doing so.  Competitiveness cannot mean reducing the means of middle and lower income groups on a continual basis while wealth in the stratosphere of the corporates or whoever goes to a higher level.  This needs to be critically examined within the European Union and is part of the British debate.  Ireland should be saying to Britain that it does not agree with it on that front.  We are not going to undermine social supports or protections for workers.<\/p> <p> There has been no public debate initiated by the Government on this issue.  Our party held a significant meeting in Cavan with a number of academics presenting.  The agricultural economist with the Irish Farmers Association was very informative and enlightening on the devastating potential impact of a British exit on agriculture and food here and in Northern Ireland.  It was the first time I had heard an articulation of concrete impacts, which I have never heard from the Government or from any Minister.  There is a complete absence of substantive debate and information on the issue.  <\/p> <p> Can the Taoiseach tell me what specific changes the British Government is looking for?  Has it made a formal statement to him in that regard?  Everyone is now saying that it will not be treaty change, as the capacity of Europe to facilitate that is not there.  Now we are looking at something short of treaty change.  What is it?  In what specific areas is the British Government seeking change?  What is our position?  I get a sense that the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, has landed himself in it.  To appease the sceptics within his own party, he announced the \"in or out\" referendum without a clear agenda or pathway as to how it would work out.  He will now want other EU countries to help him and to facilitate Britain in getting a \"Yes\" vote in the referendum when it transpires.  <\/p> <p> What plans are in place to protect Irish business and enterprise in this context?  Does the Taoiseach accept the ESRI estimate that a British exit from the European Union could wipe about &euro;4 billion off the value of Irish exports?  We know the European Union has played a very significant role in assisting Northern Ireland's recovery.  EU funds totalling about &euro;500 million have been invested in Northern Ireland through the peace initiative and other initiatives.  Brexit would have a very significant impact on Northern Ireland and on the entire island.  Would, for example, controls be reintroduced at the Border?  Has the Taoiseach a position paper on this?  Could he publish the position papers which must have been drawn up by his Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?<\/p> <p> There was a decision in May of this year, only a month or two ago, to set up a new division within the Department of the Taoiseach to cover the relationship between Britain, Ireland and Northern Ireland.  That suggests an acknowledgement of what we have been saying for years about the detachment of the Government from issues pertaining to Northern Ireland, North-South relationships and the Good Friday Agreement.  There has been an increase in the Civil Service capacity within the Department of an Taoiseach to deal with these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900020#S03900","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443541500,"counter":213,"content":"<p>The Deputy started by saying that my response was full of banal generalities and that it was unclear what the Irish position is.

That needs careful analysis and scrutiny.<\/p>  <p>  Third, making the European Union more fair, preventing non-eurozone countries from being disadvantaged by decisions taken solely by the eurozone.  The Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron has said repeatedly that he sits at the European Council and that as he is not a member of the eurozone, he would not like to think that decisions made within that zone will impact adversely on countries which are outside it but which are within the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Fourth, addressing migration and welfare.  They are the four main points Mr. Cameron set out in terms of wanting change.  The Prime Minister presented those general principles and they are doing technical work on what that actually means.  The Prime Minister has visited quite a number of the leaders and intends to present his proposals in detail after the October meeting.  As I stand here talking to the Deputy, we still only have that broad sense of the issues that are of concern to the British Government.  We do not have the detail.  It is important to see what exactly is put on the table.  <\/p>  <p>  As I indicated to the Prime Minister, given that there is a large Irish contingent living in England - 70,000 on the boards of British companies - we appreciate how important it would be that the British electorate - it is its business - would eventually decide on the nature of the question it is being asked and that it would respond by saying it wants Britain to continue to be a forthright and strong member of the European Union.  Within that, there are aspects to which we can point from our own experience in dealing with the fiscal stability treaty in the middle of the greatest recession of 60 years.<\/p>  <p>  I signed a letter some years ago with the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, about improving the way in which the efficiency of the Union operates, including such issues as red tape and administration.  Everybody supports these and they are part of what he is concerned with.  With regard to any changes that the British might require either for EU legislation or for policy, where they are reasonable and achievable, I do not see why we cannot be supportive of them.  I made it clear to him that there will more than likely be issues on which we cannot be supportive and he understands that.  If a UK proposal would be unrealistic or damaging to this country's interests, we will say so and be very forthright about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900021#U01100","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions (Resumed)","time":1443541500,"counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900021#T00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UK Referendum on EU Membership","time":1443541500,"counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900021#T00200"},{"type":"question","time":1443541500,"counter":225,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[11634\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900021#T00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if his Department is assessing the impact of an exit by the United Kingdom from the European Union following a referendum being held; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","time":1443541500,"counter":226,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[15227\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900021#T00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he discussed with the British Prime Minister, Mr David Cameron, in any of his recent conversations, the issue of a referendum in Britain seeking British withdrawal from the European Union.","asker":"1066","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","time":1443541500,"counter":227,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[15228\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900021#T00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if his departmental officials have prepared a report on the likely impact to this State of a British withdrawal from the European Union.

I to 18, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The place of the UK in the European Union is of real national importance for Ireland and is a strategic priority for the Government.  We are, therefore, watching developments very closely, engaging with our counterparts and doing all we can to help to keep the United Kingdom in the European Union.  When I met with Prime Minister Cameron in London on 18 June, we discussed his pledge to hold an in-out referendum on EU membership before the end of 2017, the general outline of his proposals for EU reform, the thinking around treaty change and other issues relating to the EU-UK relationship.  We also discussed our specific concerns about the impact a change in the nature of the EU-UK relationship could have on economic and trade links between our two countries and on stability in Northern Ireland.  As I described previously in the House, on 23 June, that meeting was both positive and constructive.  The Prime Minister did not ask for any particular support in respect of any proposal.  However, I made it clear to him how much value we attach to the fact that both our countries are members of the European Union.  I said that, without necessarily agreeing on all points, Ireland will be as helpful as it can be in the negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is obviously of great importance to the European Union as a whole and it arises frequently in discussions with my EU counterparts, as it did last weekend.  At the European Council on 25 and 26 June, Prime Minister Cameron presented a brief outline of his thinking, following meetings with most of the leaders of the European Union.  A lengthy debate did not take place at that meeting, but it was agreed that consultations would be undertaken to see how the issues might be progressed.  At the October European Council meeting, which will be held on 15 and 16 October, President Tusk intends updating Heads of State and Government on the state of play of the technical work that has been under way in Brussels since the June discussion.<\/p>  <p>  Prime Minister Cameron has informed his colleagues and partners of his intention to present his proposals after the European Council meeting in October.  The arrangements for detailed discussions on these proposals have yet to he agreed, but it is expected that there will be further consideration by Heads of State or Government at the European Council meeting to be held in December.  It is not clear at this stage whether the British reform proposals will require treaty change.  We would in general have serious reservations about opening up the European Union treaties.  However, the substance and scope of the proposals and what is eventually acceptable to all EU partners will need to be examined before the possible need for treaty change and the form of such change can be assessed.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the publication in June by the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs on the EU-UK relationship.  It acknowledges that British membership is important not just for Ireland, but for the European Union as a whole.  The report makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of the issues at stake and is a powerful symbol of the cross-party consensus that Ireland is best served by our closest neighbour and good friend remaining in the Union.<\/p>  <p>  Departments, led by my the Department, are also very much engaged on the matter and have been for some time.  In May, a new division was established in my Department to focus specifically on relations between Ireland and Britain, including bilateral issues that arise in the context of the EU-UK debate.  That division also has responsibility for Northern Ireland where, of course, the impact of a British exit would be most severely and acutely felt.  Preparatory work has already been undertaken on questions that might arise for Ireland in the event of a possible British exit from the Union.  Of course, in that hypothetical situation much would depend on future EU-UK  arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to emphasise that the main aspect of our work has been on examining how to support UK membership of the Union rather than on planning for its withdrawal.  The Government fully recognises that the economic dimension is significant.  We are in regular contact with business groups and other civil society organisations which appreciate directly how crucial common EU membership is for the Irish-British bilateral economic relationship.  Further work is being undertaken to enhance that understanding, including research that the Department of Finance has commissioned from the Economic and Social Research Institute on macro economic links between the United Kingdom and Ireland in the context of our joint membership of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  I would add that the Government will continue to seek to ensure that Irish perspectives and concerns are understood in the United Kingdom.  Our position was set out once again in recent speeches in Britain by myself and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In my contribution to the British Irish Association in Cambridge earlier this month, I emphasised the importance of Britain's continuing membership of the European Union, including in the context of stability and prosperity on the island of Ireland.  Our embassy in London is also very much engaged in public diplomacy on the issue.  However, we are very clear that the final question will be exclusively for the electorate in the United Kingdom to decide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900021#T02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1443541500,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I am sure many postgraduate students in foreign relations and diplomacy would like to get their teeth into such a reply, because it is a lengthy masterpiece that says nothing of substance.  It is full of banal generalities, which is what we have been getting on this issue for the past year and a half since Prime Minister Cameron said what he said.  I am very unclear as to what the Irish position is and do not know where we stand on any of the issues that have been raised by the British Government in regard to its membership of and participation in the European Union.  Unfortunately, the House has not had the opportunity to debate issues discussed prior to or after the past three EU Council meetings.  This is unfortunate and unacceptable.  The Government cannot be complacent about people's attitude to the European Union and cutting debate does not help.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that statements will be scheduled before and after EU Council meetings from now on?<\/p>  <p>  I am unclear, and the Taoiseach said nothing in his reply today, of Ireland's position on any of Britain's demands.  We need to be careful.  The Taoiseach is using language saying \"we will be supportive\" and \"we will be helpful\".    Has this country anything to bring to the debate?  Of course we support fair trade, free trade, competitiveness and all of that, but Britain's own review of the balance of competencies within the Union showed that the bulk of European powers help individual states to compete on a level playing field and give them fair access to trade.  Britain's and the British Government's own analysis had little to show at the end in terms of meeting the views of eurosceptics, who tend to be sceptical of and against the European Union on emotional grounds as opposed to factual and substantive grounds.<\/p>  <p>  It is important the guarantees that exist within the European Union which allow for basic working conditions and social supports are maintained.  One of the bigger issues emerging in our two-tiered recovery is the high number of people on low incomes and wages within our economy.  This is a trend across Europe and we need a proper debate in Europe on the issue.  In our never-ending move towards what is labelled as competitiveness, we are shoe-horning a significant cohort of the population into permanent, low wage jobs with exploitative, zero hour and low hour contracts and so on.<\/p><p>These things have taken from many families and young people any certainty about security of tenure in housing, mortgages, buying a car, and so on.  At European level and at the level of leaders all of this terminology gets thrown around.  Of course we must be more competitive, but there are different ways of doing so.  Competitiveness cannot mean reducing the means of middle and lower income groups on a continual basis while wealth in the stratosphere of the corporates or whoever goes to a higher level.  This needs to be critically examined within the European Union and is part of the British debate.  Ireland should be saying to Britain that it does not agree with it on that front.  We are not going to undermine social supports or protections for workers.<\/p> <p> There has been no public debate initiated by the Government on this issue.  Our party held a significant meeting in Cavan with a number of academics presenting.  The agricultural economist with the Irish Farmers Association was very informative and enlightening on the devastating potential impact of a British exit on agriculture and food here and in Northern Ireland.  It was the first time I had heard an articulation of concrete impacts, which I have never heard from the Government or from any Minister.  There is a complete absence of substantive debate and information on the issue.  <\/p> <p> Can the Taoiseach tell me what specific changes the British Government is looking for?  Has it made a formal statement to him in that regard?  Everyone is now saying that it will not be treaty change, as the capacity of Europe to facilitate that is not there.  Now we are looking at something short of treaty change.  What is it?  In what specific areas is the British Government seeking change?  What is our position?  I get a sense that the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, has landed himself in it.  To appease the sceptics within his own party, he announced the \"in or out\" referendum without a clear agenda or pathway as to how it would work out.  He will now want other EU countries to help him and to facilitate Britain in getting a \"Yes\" vote in the referendum when it transpires.  <\/p> <p> What plans are in place to protect Irish business and enterprise in this context?  Does the Taoiseach accept the ESRI estimate that a British exit from the European Union could wipe about &euro;4 billion off the value of Irish exports?  We know the European Union has played a very significant role in assisting Northern Ireland's recovery.  EU funds totalling about &euro;500 million have been invested in Northern Ireland through the peace initiative and other initiatives.  Brexit would have a very significant impact on Northern Ireland and on the entire island.  Would, for example, controls be reintroduced at the Border?  Has the Taoiseach a position paper on this?  Could he publish the position papers which must have been drawn up by his Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?<\/p> <p> There was a decision in May of this year, only a month or two ago, to set up a new division within the Department of the Taoiseach to cover the relationship between Britain, Ireland and Northern Ireland.  That suggests an acknowledgement of what we have been saying for years about the detachment of the Government from issues pertaining to Northern Ireland, North-South relationships and the Good Friday Agreement.  There has been an increase in the Civil Service capacity within the Department of an Taoiseach to deal with these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900021#T02200","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443542100,"counter":246,"content":"<p>The Deputy started by saying that my response was full of banal generalities and that it was unclear what the Irish position is.

This relates to the role of national parliaments as well as the concept of ever-closer union.  That needs careful analysis and scrutiny.<\/p>  <p>  Third, making the European Union more fair, preventing non-eurozone countries from being disadvantaged by decisions taken solely by the eurozone.  The Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron has said repeatedly that he sits at the European Council and that as he is not a member of the eurozone, he would not like to think that decisions made within that zone will impact adversely on countries which are outside it but which are within the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Fourth, addressing migration and welfare.  They are the four main points Mr. Cameron set out in terms of wanting change.  The Prime Minister presented those general principles and they are doing technical work on what that actually means.  The Prime Minister has visited quite a number of the leaders and intends to present his proposals in detail after the October meeting.  As I stand here talking to the Deputy, we still only have that broad sense of the issues that are of concern to the British Government.  We do not have the detail.  It is important to see what exactly is put on the table.  <\/p>  <p>  As I indicated to the Prime Minister, given that there is a large Irish contingent living in England - 70,000 on the boards of British companies - we appreciate how important it would be that the British electorate - it is its business - would eventually decide on the nature of the question it is being asked and that it would respond by saying it wants Britain to continue to be a forthright and strong member of the European Union.  Within that, there are aspects to which we can point from our own experience in dealing with the fiscal stability treaty in the middle of the greatest recession of 60 years.<\/p>  <p>  I signed a letter some years ago with the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, about improving the way in which the efficiency of the Union operates, including such issues as red tape and administration.  Everybody supports these and they are part of what he is concerned with.  With regard to any changes that the British might require either for EU legislation or for policy, where they are reasonable and achievable, I do not see why we cannot be supportive of them.  I made it clear to him that there will more than likely be issues on which we cannot be supportive and he understands that.  If a UK proposal would be unrealistic or damaging to this country's interests, we will say so and be very forthright about it.<\/p><p>I believe the Deputy did the right thing in having a debate on it.  I would not like to believe, however, that we would set out all the implications for us here because what the British people actually do is not within our control.  However, the additional personnel in the section of the Department of the Taoiseach dealing with Northern Ireland and watching these issues as they unfold do not in themselves comprise a new, additional resource.  There is a lot of work going on within the Departments to allow us to best understand what actually is meant here.  I include the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Finance.  The latter has commissioned the ESRI to do work on the macro-economic links between Ireland and Britain.  The focus of that is such that we should be able to promote the reasons Britain should stay in the Union.  We will study carefully the indications coming from the British side before the Prime Minister presents his detailed proposals after the October meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900022#U01100","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443542700,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, who is representing Deputy Gerry Adams.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900023#V00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1443542700,"counter":258,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach moved from bland generalisations to worrying, bland generalisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900023#V00300","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1443542700,"counter":259,"content":"<p>Accurate and factual.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900023#V00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1443542700,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Let me just probe this a little bit further with the Taoiseach.  He referred to circumstances in which we can be helpful.  He said we will try to be helpful.  I find that a little worrying.  Let me tell the Taoiseach why.  The tenor and nature of the reservations of British Tories, UKIP and a variety of other political forces about the European Union have been very obvious for a long time, particularly in recent times.  I say this as a person who herself believes the European project is on the wrong track and that the European Union is long overdue a radical reassessment and a radical overhaul.  That is my position and that of Sinn F&eacute;in on these matters.  Is the corollary of prioritising more competition not the downgrading of &quot;social Europe&quot; yet again?<\/p><p>With regard to the issue raised concerning migration and welfare, it is scarcely surprising to say it is code for a sort of little-England, small-minded, <i>in extremis<\/i>and xenophobic view of migrants who come to Britain or any other part of the Union.  This has been made all the more acute by the trauma in Syria and elsewhere and the resulting refugee crisis.  I would be very worried if the Taoiseach were considering even for a second being helpful to a British Tory Government set on dismantling social protections, such as they are within the European Union, and placing even greater emphasis on and according greater supremacy to competition, competition law and the forces of the market or, in many cases, the forces of the jungle.  I would be very worried if he were in any way proposing to give succour to a British Tory Government that wished to roll back the tide.  What was the term that Mr. Cameron used?  Was it &quot;an influx of persons seeking to get into Britain&quot;?  His rhetoric was ugly on the issue of migration only very recently.<\/p><p>Deputy Kenny is, of course, Taoiseach but he is also the leader of Fine Gael.  He has a particular worldview and much of his outlook is shared with the British Tories.  The Tories, however, are not elected in any part of Ireland, as the Taoiseach is well aware.  Certainly, this jurisdiction and its Taoiseach should not be party to any rowing back of social protection or social provision, much less playing into the hands of a xenophobic outlook in respect of migration.<\/p><p>Rather than having a generalised, bland or abstract perspective on what the British may or may not be looking for, we and the Government should have a very strong view on what we believe should be prioritised by way of reform at EU level.  More to the point, the Taoiseach should know and be prepared to state very publicly on the floor of the D&aacute;il those places to which he will not go to mollify or curry favour with Mr. David Cameron and his Tory colleagues.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach refers to the North almost as an afterthought in this debate.  He says he is worried about the stability of the North.  That is fair enough but the truth is that, in terms of our national interest and the interest of Ireland, the biggest dilemma and biggest potential problem for us consequent to any Brexit is the North.  That is not a minor detail.  In my view, it ought to be the centrepiece of the Taoiseach's and our concerns for any British exit strategy.  In the Taoiseach's conversations with Mr. Cameron, has he asked him about this referendum and the North?  Has he put it to Mr. Cameron that the people of the North and the others who live on the island of Ireland need to determine for themselves whether the North stays or goes in terms of EU membership?  The Taoiseach will know that, in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has made clear that the Scottish would regard it as their right to have Scotland decide on its membership, or otherwise, of the European Union.  Equally &mdash; I am sure the Taoiseach shares this view &mdash; it is a matter for the people in the North of Ireland to make that call.  While that call is so significant in terms of trade, agriculture, PEACE funding and supports, as referred to, it represents, in a much more fundamental way, big stuff for Ireland because its economy, in the medium and longer terms, will grow and develop at its optimum rate and in the best way on an all-island basis.<\/p><p>In responding to this matter so far, the Taoiseach has expressed concerns for Ireland, by which I presume he means this jurisdiction.  By saying &quot;our relationship with Britain &quot;, I presume he is referring to this jurisdiction again.  The North is almost a separate consideration.  That is the wrong way to go about this.  The Taoiseach says that Mr. Cameron has spoken to some leaders about his proposals.  I doubt that Mr. Cameron has been as coy with the Taoiseach as the Taoiseach is being with us in terms of setting out precisely what he has in mind.  Can the Taoiseach reassure us that he is not being quite so coy in return and that he will defend the national interest, prioritise the issue of the North and the right of its people to set its course and decide in their own right on whether it should be in the Union, and not allow a decision by England, led by Tories or anybody else, to be imposed on them, or us, as an island people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900023#V00500","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1443542700,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I am interested in the Deputy's range of views.

I wonder if the Taoiseach understands that the manner in which the EU, as part of the troika, attempted to humiliate and cow the people and Government of Greece in recent months, showed the Union as representing the major capitalist financiers within the financial markets of Europe and not the interests of the poor, the working class or the small farming community in Greece.<\/p><p>Does the Taoiseach understand that the British people would be fully justified in drawing the conclusion that the EU is utterly hypocritical when it proclaims in its treaties that it is a zone of solidarity, democratic rights and human rights when it trampled all over the rights of the Greek people and its democracy, for example, and also over the democratic and social rights of the Irish people when it cowed governments like the Taoiseach's to repay the private financiers of Europe for their reckless gambling in the Irish property bubble?  Does he understand that he and his Government's shameful and opportunistic support for the troika in attempting to cow the Greek people has strengthened the argument among ordinary people in Britain to oppose the workings of the EU and will be another justification for them opposing it?  Has he seen the opinion polls in Britain that show that despite the rantings of the Tory press, substantial cohorts of ordinary people in Britain oppose the neoliberal drive of the EU, particularly in respect of privatisation, and stand for bringing critical services like water, rail and transport into public ownership again?  <\/p> <p> Is the Taoiseach being informed about the how the debate is shaping up for the referendum campaign ahead?  Does he know that socialists and significant elements of the labour movement with a small \"L\" in Britain are seriously discussing how they will campaign against the right-wing and neoliberal policies of the EU in the referendum and, very importantly, will counterpose to the xenophobia, racism and false right-wing populism of parties like UKIP and the fascist elements in Britain who are attempting to take advantage of the disasters that neoliberal capitalism has inflicted the idea of a really democratic and socialist Europe where real social solidarity can be based on breaking the power of the major corporations, which predominate - all one needs to do is look at Volkswagen and its scandalous carry-on in the past week and the massive tax avoidance of major multinationals operating in Europe and here - and genuine social and democratic ownership of key services in the interests of our people, including a banking industry in the interests of all people?  That is the basis on which genuine solidarity can be built among the peoples of Europe.  We see the scandalous situation of 25 million Europeans, particularly young people, cast on the stones of unemployment by the type of Europe that the Taoiseach and his colleagues in the EU have created.

There is a need for the Taoiseach to very sharply distance himself and this country from what is motivating the Prime Minister in his attitude towards the EU referendum.<\/p>  <p>  I am less concerned about the European Union than I am about the future of Europe and European citizens, which is an important distinction.  Would the Taoiseach agree that Europe is at quite a dangerous crossroads and the motivations behind a possible Brexit point in a rather dangerous and worrying direction?  To put it simply, is the British Prime Minister not pandering to the racist and xenophobic forces in British society, particularly UKIP, whose anti-immigrant, anti-refugee rhetoric is alarming?<\/p>  <p>  This comes against a background of a very worrying rise of the far-right, xenophobic, racist and in some cases outright fascist forces in Europe, most notably manifest by the growth of Golden Dawn, outright neo-Nazis, in Greece.  The British Prime Minister is pandering to these people.  They are getting an audience because disillusionment with the European Union is reaching crisis levels.  Certain forces are willing in a cynical, nasty and reactionary way to try to channel that disillusionment with Europe in a very dark direction.  We must distance ourselves from this and call it for what it is because I believe that is what the Prime Minister is doing and the dogs on the street know it.  He is pandering to forces on his right that he is worried could outflank the Tories and that is a dangerous road to go down.<\/p>  <p>  Is it not also the case that the disillusionment that these forces can tap into is the responsibility of the European Union itself given the kinds of things it has done to the people of Greece when they demanded an end to austerity, change, fairness, respect for their democratic mandate and were instead bullied into submission?  They were told by the European Central Bank, an unaccountable, unelected body, that it would cut off the money if they tried to end the austerity policies as they promised.  Is that not discrediting the European Union?<\/p>  <p>  I take some hope from a different kind of reaction to disillusionment with the European Union in the form of the support for Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, MP.  However, when one looks at the vicious reactionary assault of the Tory press on Mr. Corbyn, one sees the kinds of forces we are ranged against.  I would like to see the Taoiseach echo some of the things Mr. Corbyn is saying.  I met Mr. Corbyn's economic advisor, Mr. Richard Murphy, the renowned international tax expert who is advising him on his economic policies.  He told me something very interesting that relates to the issue of competition and so on that the Taoiseach mentioned, which is one of the other concerns of the British Prime Minister in all this.  Mr. Murphy told how he used to be in business here in Ireland when he engaged in the manufacture of game boards for Trivial Pursuit in County Clare.  He said he had an interesting engagement with our tax regime at the time he was setting that up.

There are a range of issues that are very sensitive, very difficult to resolve and very real.  At last week's European Council meeting, which was a very constructive meeting, the fault lines that now apply because of what is happening in Syria, Libya and other places were very clear with more than 1 million refugees in south Lebanon and 1 million in Jordan.  Were both of these countries to collapse because there is no real plan to deal with that humanitarian crisis, the issue for Europe would not just be millions of refugees in single figures but millions in double figures.<\/p>  <p>  When one hears a prime minister saying that what happens when refugees leave Turkey, which is a very short distance from some of the Greek isles, that as soon as a boat appears, dinghies that are grossly overladen with people are ripped asunder with knives so that they end up in the water and have to be saved or drowned, one can understand the challenge that this presents.  The huge numbers of people, including women and children, walking into small countries in many cases exhausted and expected to be registered under the Dublin Agreement and the Schengen Agreement, has presented logistical issues they are unable to cope with. <\/p>  <p>  Germany has taken in 500,000 refugees this year.  Ireland, a small country that is not a member of Schengen and not inside the protocol, is because of our own tradition offering voluntarily to take in 4,000 refugees.  Clearly the discussions that took place in New York yesterday are not conclusive in respect of what is going to happen in Syria.  In this regard I have referred on other occasions to why things should be done to deal with migration.  I recently opened a facility where one of the managing directors was a young woman who came here as a refugee with her parents.  She was educated here and is contributing greatly to our society in a really important position.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy made the point about young people being unemployed and he is right.  Let us consider where Ireland was four and a half years ago, locked out of all markets, interest rates of 15%, borrowings of &euro;22.5 billion and haemorrhaging thousands of jobs every year.<\/p><p>However, in a short time, because the Government and people made difficult decisions, some economic indicators say we will grow by more than 5.5% this year and even more next year.  Whether that will be the case or not remains to be seen.  In many countries that have real difficulties, it is a question of making difficult decisions in those countries' interest to move them forward.  It is grossly unacceptable to have 25 million young people unemployed.  Everybody accepts that.  We would like to think that due to our efforts here we will see more people with experience coming back next year than will leave.<\/p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned right and left and extremes.  Where young people are not given the opportunity to be challenged in terms of their careers and opportunities, they get frustrated, angry and take to the streets.  They could be either on the right or the left.  The centre, centre right and centre left are often forgotten.  That is the momentum in terms of having to pull people in from the sides and move forward with any individual country.  The Deputy might differ on that, from a political perspective.  I am glad he said that one has to pay taxes to have roads.  One has to pay taxes to have any service because nothing is free in this world.  I hope that by the time we get to 2018, our country will have a balanced budget and the rules of the European Commission that tie us down in terms of the fiscal stability treaty will be very much relaxed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900026#Y01000","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443545100,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Could we get the rich to pay taxes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900027#Z00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1443545100,"counter":301,"content":"<p>The more people we have working, the less tax they will have to pay and the greater the range of services there can be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900027#Z00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443545100,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Written Answers follow Adjournment.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1443545100,"counter":303,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900027#Z00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1443545100,"counter":304,"content":"<p>It is proposed to take No. 13, motion re referral to joint committee of proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the transfer of proceeds from the sale of the State&rsquo;s shareholding in Aer Lingus; and No. 46, Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015 - Report Stage, resumed. <\/p>  <p>  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) in the event a division is in progress at the time fixed for taking Private Members&rsquo; business, the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 9 p.m. and shall adjourn on the adjournment of Private Members&rsquo; business, which shall be No. 206, motion re social housing and shall, if not previously concluded, adjourn after 90 minutes; (2) No. 13 shall be decided without debate; and tomorrow&rsquo;s business after Oral Questions shall be: No. 46, Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015 - Report Stage, resumed; No. 6, Finance (Tax Appeals) Bill 2015 - Order for Second Stage and Second Stage: and No. 7, Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015 - Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900027#Z00500","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1443545100,"counter":305,"content":"<p>There are two proposals to put to the House.

Is this what we have come to?  All of us in this House have heard of numerous cases where councils failed to take enforcement measures against people who flagrantly disregarded planning laws, yet a 90-year old woman was taken to court over a satellite dish which she got as a birthday present.  The context is the promised planning and development Bill.  I ask that a clause would be inserted in the Bill to ensure something like this does not happen again, and that some sense of decency and humanity prevails in terms of how we enforce planning laws, because God knows an awful lot of them have not been enforced.  People with far greater clout get away with far more than a senior citizen who has been dragged through the courts at such an age.  <\/p>  <p>  The planning and development Bill was promised by the Government.  We read on Sunday and Monday about rent now being tied to inflation for a four-year period.  Could the Taoiseach confirm that such a legislative proposal will be introduced within the next month?  When can we expect the legislation about rent certainty and tying rent to inflation for a four-year period?<\/p>  <p>  I seek clarification from the Taoiseach on the implementation of the programme for Government in terms of health.  The Government said in the programme that it would introduce universal health insurance, UHI, with equal access to care for all.  The document stated that under this system, there would be no discrimination between patients on the grounds of income or insurance status and the two-tier system of unequal access to hospital care would end.  For good measure, the Government was very clear and specific four and a half years ago when it stated that a system of universal health insurance would be introduced by 2016, with the legislative and organisational groundwork for the system complete within this Government&rsquo;s term of office.  It was further stated that everyone would have a choice between competing insurers and that UHI would provide guaranteed access to care for all in public and private hospitals.  It was stated that Exchequer funding for hospital care would go into a hospital insurance fund.  There is an entire page on it but I will not go on about it at length, except to say that it was stated that the legislative basis for UHI would be established by the universal health insurance Act.<\/p>  <p>  It was stated that a patient safety authority, incorporating HIQA, would be established and that the Government would act speedily to reduce costs in the delivery of both public and private health care and in the administration of the health care system.  The document goes on and on for approximately eight pages in terms of the pathway to universal care insurance, the hospital care purchase agency and stating that legislation would be introduced.  Reference was made to an expansion in the care for older people and community care.  The programme for Government stated that there would be additional money every year and more home care packages every year.  It was stated that the fair deal system of financing nursing home care would be reviewed, with a view to developing a secure and equitable system of financing for community and long-term care which supports older people to stay in their homes.

We have been promised the reformed and consolidated domestic violence Bill and we were led to believe it would be prioritised in the course of this Administration's tenure.  It now appears the legislation will not have come through the Oireachtas by the time the D&aacute;il is dissolved and we go to the people.  This is a matter of immense frustration.  I engaged in lengthy correspondence with the previous Minister, Deputy Shatter, on this issue.  He rather unhelpfully wrote to inform me he was not considering this legislation because he had better and more important things to do.  That was when the troika was in town but we were then told the legislation would be prioritised and it clearly has not been.  The Bill is listed in section B and its expected publication date is 2016.  It is very poor that the Taoiseach and his Government have failed to bring forward this legislation despite all the crocodile tears.  It is a matter of huge disappointment.<\/p>  <p>  The disability and equality (miscellaneous provisions) Bill was to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities and to make further technical amendments to disability and equality legislation.  This has been anticipated for quite some time but the Taoiseach and all of us will discover, when we speak to people in the course of the election campaign, the extent to which those with disabilities feel they have suffered very serious and disproportionate cutbacks at the hands of the Government.  The Government has now failed to introduce this and other items of legislation to underpin the rights of these people and to ratify international instruments.<\/p>  <p>  Third, and finally, the criminal justice (Stormont House Agreement) implementation Bill refers not to budgetary matters or sustainable budgets but is to give effect to the provisions of the Stormont House Agreement that deal with the legacy of the past.  There remains a difficulty in respect of so-called Tory welfare reform, for which one must read \"cuts\", but both the British Government and the Government in Dublin have been slow and taken their eye off the ball by not bringing forward the legislation relating to the Stormont House Agreement that was expected.  The Taoiseach rather ironically suggested that Sinn F&eacute;in - which, unlike his party, is elected in the North - not take its eye off the ball but it is, in fact, the Taoiseach who has taken his eye off the ball.  Under \"Status of Bill\" it reads, \"Publication Expected - Not possible to indicate at this stage.\"  That is not great, is it?  It is not helpful or the sign of a Government or a Taoiseach with their eye on the ball as regards stability and peacemaking in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900028#AA00800","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1443545700,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Believe me, the eye is very much on the ball.

I cannot give a date for publication except to say that those negotiations have gone very well and are very well advanced.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the reformed and consolidated domestic violence Bill.  The heads of this were cleared in July and the estimated time for publication is early next year so the Deputy is not in a position to say it will not be published before the House is dissolved, unless she knows something I do not know.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's third point in respect of disability, I met representatives of disabled groups recently.  We have taken a different line in Ireland from that taken by other countries which have signed the convention but not introduced the legislation.  There are a number of pieces of quite complex legislation which we have now put into a roadmap so that we know exactly what we have to do to legislate before we actually sign.  This includes the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, which was published in 2013 and which is currently ready for Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.  It will address the existing legislation governing capacity and will provide a series of options to support people with decision-making capacity difficulties to make decisions and exercise their basic rights in line with the principles of the convention.  This morning there was another presentation where the categorisation of persons of unsound mind, a category which has existed from way back along the line and who are not in a position to stand for any electoral office, will be dealt with under an amendment to this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  There is mental health legislation and there are other Department of Health issues and a review of the Mental Health Act 2001 has been completed.  The report of the expert group was published on 5 March last.  The bulk of the 165 recommendations relate to changes in mental health legislation and the Department is working on a general scheme to reflect those changes in revised legislation.  The Minister for Health will separately deal with reform of the legislation regarding the use of electroconvulsive therapy, ECT.  The Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2008, which passed all stages in the Seanad in 2011, is currently on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  When enacted, it will make immediate changes to the Mental Health Act 2001 to ensure that ECT cannot be administered to an involuntary patient who has capacity and who refuses such treatment.<\/p>  <p>  There are two main elements to the criminal law legislation.  Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 needs to be replaced and work is well under way on that.  On 16 December last the Government approved the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2014 for publication, which includes wide-ranging provisions to protect and enhance the protection of children and vulnerable persons from sexual abuse and exploitation.  Amendments to repeal section 5 of the Act are being prepared.<\/p><p>Second, an amendment to section 4 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 will be necessary to address the issue of discriminatory treatment of persons whose decision-making capacity is in question.

In May of this year, the Supreme Court held that lenders were not required to comply with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, CCMA, prior to seeking a court order for the repossession of a person's home.  It found that the only circumstance where the courts could use the code as a reason not to grant a repossession order was where a lender sought repossession while ignoring the moratorium periods set out in the code, otherwise non-compliance with the code does not interfere with a lender's entitlement to seek repossession of a home.<\/p><p>The Supreme Court also found that the code is not deemed by current legislation to be an implied term in the agreement between a homeowner and his or her lender.  The fact that lenders no longer have to comply fully with the CCMA could lead to a significant increase in the number of home repossession cases before the courts unless emergency legislation is introduced to close this loophole.  In August, I called on the Government to introduce the necessary emergency legislation to close the loophole and made it clear that Fianna F&aacute;il would publish its own legislation if the Government failed to do so.  Remarkably, the Government has failed to include the necessary legislation in the legislative programme and, therefore, I have brought forward this Bill.<\/p><p>This draft legislation would require lenders to show that they had materially complied with the CCMA and its mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, before they became entitled to seek a court order for the repossession of somebody's home.  The Bill envisages that the courts would dismiss a repossession application where it concluded that a lender had not complied with the relevant code or resolution process.  This legislation would also apply to so-called vulture funds that buy mortgage books from lenders.  They would be required to comply with the code and resolution process, even if these did not otherwise apply to such funds for other reasons.  The CCMA is important because it requires lenders to explore alternative repayment arrangements such as reducing the mortgage interest rate, split mortgage or extending the term of the mortgage.  A lender may only commence legal proceedings for repossession of a borrower's primary residence where it has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative arrangement with the borrower but, as it stands, because of the loophole this legislation seeks to close, there is no effective remedy for homeowners when a lender ignores that requirement and commences legal proceedings for repossession without making an effort to agree an alternative arrangement.<\/p><p>The loophole exposed by the Supreme Court also permits repossessions where lenders have illegally imposed charges or surcharge interest on arrears where borrowers have been co-operating with the lender as best they can.  It also devalues the requirement under the code whereby lenders must ensure their communications with borrowers are not aggressive, intimidating or harassing.  There have been shocking revelations that some people were forced out of their homes by lenders failing to return them to their original tracker mortgage interest rate after they had temporarily fixed their interest rate.  I raised this as a Topical Issue last Wednesday and, in that context, it is particularly significant that the CCMA prevents lenders from forcing a borrower to move from an existing tracker rate to another type of mortgage as part of an alternative repayment arrangement.  It seems that the loophole that was discovered in the Dunne case last May could permit a lender to repossess a family home where the borrower has been illegally forced into further mortgage arrears by being forced off their tracker rate, which is unacceptable.<\/p><p>The judgment revealed a massive loophole, which merited emergency legislation immediately to repair it.  I have been taken aback that the Government has shown no sign of being willing to require banks to comply with what is supposed to be a mandatory code of conduct before they seek to repossess a family home.  I therefore introduce the Bill on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il to remedy this loophole and the huge injustice that would occur in a case where a bank has acted illegally but is nevertheless entitled to repossess a family home because of a technical flaw in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900029#BB00800","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1443546300,"counter":336,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900029#BB00900","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1443546300,"counter":337,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900029#BB01000","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1443546300,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900029#BB01100","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1443546300,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900029#BB01200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443546300,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Aer Lingus Sale Proceeds Transfer: Referral to Joint Committee","time":1443546300,"counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900029#BB01400"},{"type":"speech","time":1443546300,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the payment by the Minister for Finance, pursuant to section 46(1) of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, from the Central Fund to the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund of &euro;335,272,562.50 (three-hundred and thirtyfive million, two-hundred and seventy-two thousand, five-hundred and sixty-two euro and fifty cent) being the amount of the funds derived from the proceeds of the sale of the State&rsquo;s shareholding in Aer Lingus, be referred to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, in accordance with Standing Order 82A(4)(j), which, not later than 15th October, 2015, shall send a message to the D&aacute;il in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 87, and Standing Order 86(2) shall accordingly apply.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900029#BB01500","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443546300,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Debate","time":1443546300,"counter":344,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900029#BB01700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Disputes","time":1443546300,"counter":345,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900029#BB01750"},{"type":"speech","time":1443546300,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Possible strike action by people contracted to work in An Post main delivery centres could bring a halt to all postal services on Thursday next as 34 maintenance delivery centre workers go on strike.

Shockingly for workers, the company tried to change the work rosters from 12-hour to eight-hour shifts without their agreement.  Such a change would result in more than a 20% cut for workers and also means some employees would have to work permanent night shifts, according to Communications Workers' Union, which represents the maintenance workers.  <\/p> <p> The company was served with strike notice by maintenance workers last week after it cut workers' wages because of their refusal to work the new roster.

It was brought in 25 years ago and, parking the politics, I thought it was innovative legislative action by the Minister at the time.  It is now appropriate it is extended to other areas.<\/p>  <p>  The benefits of the scheme include significant reductions in respiratory problems and mortalities from the effects of burning smoky coal.  Approximately 8,000 lives have been saved in Dublin since the introduction of the smoky coal ban back in 1990.  Further health, environmental and economic benefits, estimated at &euro;53 million per year, will be realised if the ban is extended nationwide.  Hundreds of lives will be saved by this action.<\/p>  <p>  The success of the introduction of the ban in Dublin in 1990, as well as its subsequent extension to Cork, Limerick and Galway, has resulted in the perverse anomaly whereby air quality in some provincial towns and villages during the winter is of a vastly poorer quality than in our larger urban areas and towns.  Recent research by University College Cork highlighted that air pollution in Killarney can be ten times higher during the night than throughout the day.  During the winter, young people playing sports in many large towns are exposed to carcinogens in the air at higher multiples to what is acceptable.  This cannot continue.<\/p>  <p>  The original ban in Dublin has been cited widely as a successful policy intervention and has become a best practice icon in the international clean air community.  This view was reiterated at yesterday&rsquo;s conference by several visiting delegates, including those from the World Health Organization, WHO.  Ireland became the first country in the world to introduce a nationwide smoking ban ten years ago.  We are showing similar leadership in clean air policy.<\/p>  <p>  I have instructed my Department to commence the process that will see the benefits of the smoky coal ban extended nationwide.  This process involves consultation with the EU, our colleagues across government, residential fuel market operators and the general public.  I am encouraged by the industry&rsquo;s acknowledgement of the need to improve our air quality and its plans to adapt current practices, as well as investing in cleaner, lower-smoke fuels.  Deputy Stanley is correct that this presents many opportunities for Bord na M&oacute;na and others involved in the industry.  Many of them are already investing in alternative fuel technologies.  The Government is encouraging them to do more in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  I hope these consultations will be completed in time to have the necessary provisions in place for the heating season in 2016.  However, I accept this is an ambitious timeline and may stretch into the following year.  The extension of the smoky coal ban is one of several initiatives my Department is examining as part of a programme to produce the first ever national clean air strategy.  This strategy will provide the strategic framework for a set of cross-government policies and actions to reduce harmful emissions, as well as improving air quality and public health to meet current and future EU and international obligations.

It was debated in 2012.  The Minister for Justice and Equality rejected the Bill despite cross-party support.  Since then there has been report after report.  There was a report from the national metal theft forum, which recommended that Oireachtas Joint Committees should examine the matter.  This has not happened.<\/p><p>I reintroduced the Bill in 2014 after the then Minister had rejected it in 2012 and promised to introduce his own legislation.  I introduced eight amendments which he had suggested were necessary and, sadly, the current Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, rejected it.  Lo and behold, only ten days ago the Minister, the Department and the Government announced a public consultation.  It is a complete whitewash and a sham, an effort to get them past the election.  All they had to consult were the homes, the families, communities, the Georgian Society, the ESB, Irish Rail, the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA.  All these groups and families have been devastated by brutal attacks on their property and, above all, on their homes.  One's home is one's castle.  Very valuable artefacts have been taken.  In Portlaoise, a monument erected on a motorway to 23 or 24 dead young people, was unceremoniously cut down and taken away.  Hospitals have been attacked.  Precious gold and items with sentimental value, passed down through generations, have been taken from people's homes.  Some of those items can be put in an envelope and sold to a cash-for-gold outlet and the money is returned in the post.  I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is standing in for the Minister for Justice and Equality, to consider this and act.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na supports it but needs the tools of the trade to tackle these roving criminals and monstrous people who do awful damage to protected and listed buildings but, above all, to people&rsquo;s homes and person.<\/p><p>My short scrap and precious metal Bill had four aims, including that precious metals and all transactions be recorded and that there be a waiting period for anybody who received an item or sold it on.  Whether it is scrap metal or rings, jewellery or watches of sentimental value, the receiver should hold the item for 30 days in order that the seller or owner, and the Garda, would have a chance to identify it, if it was traced.  This would ensure items were not melted down the morning after.  The third aim of my Bill was that the Garda should have access to all the files and the books.  The Revenue Commissioners have access to all businesses.  I am a businessman.  The Health and Safety Authority has access.  Why can this matter not be regulated?<\/p><p>The final aim was to set penalties for the precious metal dealers.  The penalties were pretty saucy but they were needed so that, for example, I could not sell to the Minister of State, or <i>vice versa<\/i>, or to anybody else, without having a personal public service, PPS, number, and the value added tax, VAT, number of the trader.  All businesses, from farmers to hairdressers, must comply with regulations and have their books ready for audit.  This is a rogue&rsquo;s industry.  It is a paradise for them.  The Government is either unable or unwilling to deal with this issue.  I do not know why.  It is visiting trauma on families and communities as precious artefacts are exported and melted down.  When I introduced my Bill, some speakers said that gates at level crossings in Dublin had been taken down.  The signals were taken down at Limerick Junction.  There could be a head-on crash.  Aviation equipment that sends signals to aeroplanes trying to land at and take off from Dublin Airport and other places has been taken.<\/p><p>It is a nightmare.  There is a desperate accident waiting to happen, quite apart from the trauma visited on ordinary people, their property and personages.  The Minister will go down in history for neglecting to deal with this severe crisis.  She need only take the simple legislation that is before her, amend it, bring it to committee and debate it.  I am not saying my Bill is perfect but it is something.

The Minister regrets that she is unable to be present due to other business.  I assure the Deputy that the Minister is very conscious of the concerns that exist in respect of the theft of scrap and precious metals and that her Department continues to work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other relevant stakeholders to ensure that an effective, whole of system response is in place.  Measures in respect of the sale of scrap metal were taken by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in 2014, which were designed to address this matter by improving the traceability of scrap metal.  These regulations include requirements to obtain proof of identity of sellers and the keeping of records concerning the material sold.  The Minister is well aware of the similar concerns that have been expressed about the theft of precious metals and stones and, particularly, in relation to the potential use of cash for gold outlets to sell stolen goods.<\/p><p>For that reason the Minister has recently commenced a process of public consultation on what measures may be taken in this regard.  Among the potential measures on which views are being sought are the registration of such businesses, their monitoring by compliance officers, powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of such businesses and the introduction of penalties for non-compliance with any regulations put in place.  An important element of this process of consultation is to ascertain the views of the many legitimate businesses that might be affected by any measures.  The consultation process is open until 30 October.  Once the process has concluded, the Minister will, taking into account any views expressed, determine the most appropriate approach to tackle this issue.<\/p> <p> Other ongoing practical steps also being taken by the authorities include the establishment by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of a metal theft forum involving stakeholders particularly affected by this type of crime, including the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, the Electricity Supply Board, ESB, telecommunications and transport companies, brewing concerns and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  A metal theft crime prevention and reduction plan was published in February 2013 which was developed in close co-operation with these stakeholders.  It provides for an effective multi-agency response to the problem and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is implementing a range of measures arising from the plan.<\/p> <p> The Garda has also mounted successful operations which have led to charges being brought against a number of persons involved in the theft of electricity cables in this country who appear to be connected to an international organised criminal group.  An awareness campaign to help address this form of criminality has been launched through Crimestoppers in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ESB Networks.  Rural dwellers are asked to notify the Garda of any suspicious activity they observe and may use the Crimestoppers confidential number 1800 25 00 25 to make reports if they wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900032#EE00800","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443548700,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Again, I am disappointed the Minister of State has come here to read out the same standard reply, although I have nothing personal against her.

The Minister of State referred to ESB lines being taken.  This beggars belief.  This has happened in my neighbourhood and it is costing the ESB a fortune.  However, who is paying the price?  It is the people who are paying the ESB, Joe tax man and Mrs. tax woman.<\/p>  <p>  We must have action.  We do not have time for another consultation.

They are coming in from eastern Europe, as the Minister of State said, because we are ripe and ready to be picked and plucked, like apples hanging from a tree.<\/p>  <p>  The reason is that we have an inept Government which has refused to deal with this issue.  The Government was elected by the people and Bills are regularly presented to it by Opposition Deputies.

What is wrong that it will not accept or implement legislation to protect our people?  It passes Bill after Bill to persecute people, ranging from taxes to Irish Water, but when we need a small amount of legislation to protect people in their homes, it refuses to entertain it.

All are sham and token.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know the reason that the Government will not recognise this issue and not give the power and tools to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies to deal with this perilous situation.

We are trying to make the point that one cannot measure progress unless there is a starting point from which to refer, and this is what the amendment seeks to provide.<\/p>  <p>  While I do not intend to repeat the points I started with, there are some matters that must be clarified in this regard.  It is not an airtight commitment to a 2050 target.  Even if what the Government is proposing could be construed as such, the Government policy only references carbon dioxide and none of the highly dangerous greenhouse gases listed in the amendment.  As I said on the last occasion, in the first two decades after its release methane is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide.  Both types of emissions must be addressed if we wish to reduce effectively the impact of climate change.<\/p>  <p>  A large number of amendments were ruled out of order on Committee Stage because they referred to emissions target reductions.

Those factors have not been taken into account in ruling those amendments out of order.<\/p><p>If we wanted proof of the failure of so-called modern democracy to serve the interests of the public good rather than the self-interest of the political establishment, this argument says it all.  What the Government is putting forward is incredibly short-sighted.  On Committee Stage, the Minister said, \"Setting out such definitions here is completely unnecessary as both legally binding EU and international instruments establish such matters in a far more comprehensive manner\".  This stands as a perfect example of what Peter Mair saw as the externalisation of policy commitments to non-democratic decision makers.  What we have unfolding here is politicians divesting themselves of responsibility for potentially unpopular policy decisions in order to cushion themselves from potential voter discontent in the future.<\/p><p>It is this trend that has been responsible for a bottoming out of Western democracy.  It is one of the reasons we have such lack of participation and support for the political establishment across Europe.  The weakness of the Bill is indicative of this process and of the whole process of neoliberalism itself, where the interests of the market are being put ahead of the interests of the public.  It is precisely as a result of this mentality that we will have a continuation of austerity when, really, the crisis is demanding that we should have wartime-type investment in the public sector to boost our defences and to keep global temperature increases below 2&deg; Celsius.  That requires massive investment in public transport and so on, but the neoliberal ideology is pointing in a different way, and is prioritising the next quarter's GDP figures ahead of the future of humanity and the need to take society forward.<\/p><p>We are moving this amendment based on the points made.

We need to finance poorer countries in their switch to clean development models, and we have to lead the way in the move towards a carbon-free economy.<\/p><p>In effect, if the Government recognises and appreciates the principle of climate justice, then we must be committed to the national emissions targets which will hold our law-makers accountable.  We must set the targets at levels even more ambitious than those which will come from Europe.  In order for that to happen, we need the political will.  We need politicians who are not afraid to put the interests of the people of Earth before the interests of those who profit from pollution and extractionism.<\/p><p>Recently, a coalition of more than 400 organisations called on the White House to stop issuing new fossil fuel leases on public lands and oceans.  More than 67 million acres of public land and ocean are already leased to the fossil fuel industry.  The coalition says that declaring unleased oil, gas and coal on public lands as unburnable would accomplish more in the global fight against climate change than any other single action taken by the Obama Administration.<\/p><p>We need to stop the profiteering of the fossil fuel industry.  There are thee central steps which we must take if we are serious about the principle of climate justice.  First, we must stop issuing fossil fuel leases on our public lands and oceans.  That means no more oil and gas drilling, and no fracking licences.  Second, we need to divest from fossil fuel companies any funds which are connected to the public purse strings.  Third, we need to properly enforce the polluter pays principle.<\/p><p>The vast fossil fuel subsidies estimated by the IMF for 2015 include payments, tax breaks and cut-price fuel.  The largest part is the cost left unpaid by polluters and picked up by governments, including the heavy impacts of local air pollution and the floods, droughts and storms being driven by climate change.  In May, the IMF published a global annual estimate of $5.3 trillion of fossil fuel subsidies.  It calculated that ending fossil fuel subsidies would slash global carbon emissions by 20%, a huge step towards taming global warming.  Ending the subsidies would also prevent 1.6 million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution, a 50% cut.  The money freed by ending fossil fuel subsidies could be an economic game changer for many countries, says the IMF, by driving economic growth and poverty reduction.<\/p><p>Christina Figueres, the UN climate change chief charged with delivering a deal to beat global warming at a crunch summit in December, said, &quot;The IMF data reveal a simple and stunning truth: that fossil fuel subsidy reform alone would deliver far more funds than is required for the global energy transformation we need to keep the world below a 2&deg;C temperature rise [the level Governments have promised to hold them to]&quot;.<\/p><p>In April, the president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, told the <i>Guardian<\/i>that it was crazy that governments were still driving the use of coal, oil and gas by providing subsidies.  He said they should be scrapped immediately as poorer nations were feeling the boot of climate change on their necks.  According to the recent IMF figures, this year Ireland will subsidise fossil fuel companies to the tune of $1.22 billion.  That is $262 per head, up from $1.09 billion in 2013.  A real commitment to the principle of climate justice would mean that we would stop this insane practice, curb emissions and have money to fund both our own and other nations' transition.  Not only are we failing to do this at present, we have a long track record of corporate welfare, and investing in the fossil fuel companies is at the heart of the problem.  The last published report from the National Pensions Reserve Fund was for 2013.  It showed that, of the 30 largest fossil fuel companies in the world, we had invested in 22 of them.  If those 22 companies alone burned their current reserves, it would mean an increase of over 1&deg; Celsius in the global temperature. <\/p><p> While we in Ireland are not feeling the effects of climate change so strongly, other countries are being wiped off the map.  The Irish Government, not content that it has presided over the most dramatic rise in inequality in recent history at home by failing to acknowledge climate justice, is becoming a central player in furthering the rise in inequality at a global level.  In light of the Minister's claim that he endorses the principle of climate justice, his dogged refusal to make any commitments on national targets of any kind in the legislation does not add up.  He is effectively demonstrating that the Bill is solely cosmetic and cannot serve to implement meaningful action on climate change.<\/p> <p> The UN climate chief, Ms Christiana Figueres, has warned that carbon emission reduction targets are not yet good enough.  She warned on 16 September that \"the targets for carbon emission reduction that 62 nations which account for 70% of emissions have so far submitted for agreement in Paris are not good enough to keep global warming below 2&deg;C\".  Climate scientists have been telling us that this decade is the one that matters for climate action if we are to combat the devastating effects of climate change and to tackle catastrophic global warming.  However, all amendments that refer to any specific targets have been disqualified on the grounds that they would impose a cost on the Exchequer.  This is an insane position in light of what is at stake.  This position is not just extremely short-sighted and narrow-minded considering that the cost in human lives and the cost to the Exchequer will be astronomical.  If we do not get our act together, it will cost us, according to our own figures, a fortune in fines alone.  We are currently on course for serious fines for failing to meet our climate change mitigation targets.  According to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the cost to the Exchequer of purchasing compliance will be in the billions of euro by 2030 in a business-as-usual scenario.<\/p> <p> I do not understand the logic of wiping out amendments on the basis that they could cost the Exchequer money.  Many proposals cost the Exchequer money.  Some of them are a good idea while some of them might not be but the Government should examine the rule.  I do not know where the rule comes from but I believe it is in place.  If so, it should definitely be addressed because if we continue with this approach, there will be less chance of our being able to organise this country in a more progressive way and addressing problems such as climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900036#JJ00700","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443550500,"counter":395,"content":"<p>The Oireachtas committee recommended that the legislation incorporate the principle of climate justice.  The Minister has accepted that in a part of the legislation, namely, in amendment No. 17.  We believe it is critical that the principle be inserted so Ministers will have to have regard to it when designing mitigation plans.<\/p><p>According to Naomi Klein, climate justice really means all developing countries are owed a debt for the inherent injustice of climate change and the fact that wealthy countries had used up most of the atmospheric capacity for safely absorbing carbon dioxide before the developing countries had a chance to industrialise.  It is unfair to expect developing countries, whose people have contributed so little to the climate crisis, to shoulder the economic burden of climate change mitigation.  However, if we are saying that and putting the principle into the Bill, we have to mean it.  The plan must support policies that will deliver on the principle.  That is where we have a bit of a problem.  Let us step back and consider this: the countries that have been powering their economies with fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution have done far more to cause temperatures to rise than those that arrived on the globalisation stage in the past couple of decades.  Therefore, it is not a level playing field.  Developed countries, which represent less than 20% of the world's population, have emitted almost 70% of all greenhouse gas pollution, which is destabilising the climate.<\/p><p>Where do we fit in?  Ireland is the second worst polluter <i>per capita<\/i>in Europe after Poland.  Therefore, we in Ireland owe a debt to the developing countries.  I am glad the Minister is sharing that view to the extent of saying we should build it in as a principle of our climate change Bill.  However, if nothing else in the Bill is moving us nearer to that objective, it is just meaningless and actually a bit of an insult.  It is a question of determining how to make the aspiration principle a reality in living terms.  How will we repay this debt, which has now been acknowledged?  We really need to consider how we can promote the principle of climate justice.  That is really what we need to consider.  Fighting the extractionism of the fossil fuel industry is a way to achieve it but we are not doing it.  Fighting the new free-trade deals, such as the TPP and TTIP, which are effectively corporate wish lists that will have a devastating impact on the environment, particularly in countries in the developing world, is an approach.  So, too, is reining in our over-consumption, which does not mean targeting everybody who drives a car but actually means promoting localisation of our economies, promoting serious policies on delivering public transport and greatly enhancing rail transport.  I am not referring to the sort of metro-light Ladybird version that the Government announces in fanfares a hundred times over, but to real development of public transport, including rail, beyond anything we have seen already.  We need to consider that.  It is not being built into the legislation.<\/p><p>Naomi Klein has rephrased and remoulded the discussion on climate change, which is often put outside the reach of ordinary people.  It is often packaged in terms of blaming individuals for their behaviour rather than examining how society itself is organised and what governments can do.  Ms Klein states:<\/p><blockquote>As a direct result of these centuries of serial thefts &mdash; of land, labor, and atmospheric space &mdash; developing countries today are squeezed between the impacts of global warming, made worse by persistent poverty, and by their need to alleviate that poverty, which, in the current economic system, can be done most cheaply and easily by burning a great deal more carbon, dramatically worsening the climate crisis.  They cannot break this deadlock without help, and that help can only come from those countries and corporations that grew wealthy, in large part, as a result of those illegitimate appropriations.  <br \/><br \/>[This argument] does not rest on ethics and morality alone: wealthy countries do not just need to help the Global South move to a low-emissions economic path because it's the right thing to do. We need to do it because our collective survival depends on it.<\/blockquote><p>When we talk about climate justice, we need to do so in terms of the bigger picture.  That is why I would support initiatives such as the Leap Manifesto, put forward in respect of Canada.  That document examines the issue in terms of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's recognition of the shocking details of the violence of Canada's near past.  The document refers to deepening poverty and inequality contributing to the problems of climate change.  Solutions are sought in terms of what the government can do and in terms of the bigger picture and giving communities control over their destinies, be it in terms of energy projects, energy-efficient programmes or the retrofitting of houses.  All these initiatives can generate employment, but on a serious scale.  I refer also to proper public transport.<\/p><p>While we believe we should include the principle of climate justice in various parts of the Bill &mdash; it is a good thing and we are glad the Minister has included it in part &mdash; it will not mean anything unless it is backed up with meat and substance.  Unfortunately, nothing in the Bill achieves this.  When this Bill is passed, we will be three or four years away from fines being imposed on us.  The European Union itself has said we have no chance of reaching the targets we have signed up to.  Therefore, the taxpayer will inevitably be squeezed for the money because of the lack of action of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900037#KK00200","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1443550500,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this amendment.  I regret that all my previous amendments were ruled out of order on the basis of  cost.<\/p><p>There will be a huge financial cost to the citizens of this State, including farmers, if we continue going down this road and do not address the climate change issue.  In addition, there is an issue of climate justice, not just for developing Third World countries but also here due to the effects it will have on producers and those living in areas prone to flooding.  We cannot keep building higher flood defences and hope that sea levels will not breach them.  We must deal with the issue at source.  My amendment No. 22 would compel the Government to have regard to the principle of climate change justice for developing countries and countries vulnerable to climate change.  That is very important.  <br\/><br\/>It is worth looking at what was agreed by the all-party committee back in the summer of 2013.  Since Ireland, on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis, has one of the highest greenhouse gas emission rates, its responsibility to those impacted by climate change was emphasised by several submissions.  The joint committee heard from several witnesses that it is appropriate to include recognition of this in the legislation as a principle, which should be considered in framing the national and sectoral roadmaps.<br\/><br\/>In fulfilment of commitments made under the Copenhagen accord, member states committed to providing &euro;7.2 billion of fast-track start finance over the period 2010 to 2012.  This was to enable developing countries to protect themselves better against severe weather events and other adverse effects associated with climate change and to develop their economies along sustainable pathways.  <br\/><br\/>Central to the issue of climate change and climate justice is the participation of developing countries in the green climate fund agreed at Canc&uacute;n as a successor to the fast-track start finance instrument.  The joint committee welcomed the commitments given by the former Minister, Phil Hogan, that Ireland would play its full role as a member state in supporting this initiative.  To this end, the joint committee stressed the importance that such finance should be additional to Ireland's overseas aid budget and not at the expense of it.  The Bill should provide for the establishment of a national green climate fund within or alongside the environment fund to receive moneys from carbon tax, emission-trading-system auctioning and similar sources.  That money should be used to support climate mitigation and adoption in developing countries.<br\/><br\/>The joint committee said the fund would also be used to support Ireland's contribution to the green climate fund currently now established through the UN framework convention on climate change.  That is what the all-party committee drafted in July 2013, with Professor John Sweeney, after listening carefully to submissions from some who still believe the earth is flat and others who wanted us to go much further than the report's recommendations.  This was a compromise document but is a good way forward.  <br\/><br\/>Climate justice must be writ large throughout the Bill, otherwise we will not be doing our own population any favours, nor those of countries that are only now starting to develop industrially.  They have put a very light carbon footprint on the face of the earth, much lighter than ours.  Ireland is a huge producer of carbon emissions, so we must start doing things more sustainably, but that does not mean that we have to close down the country.<br\/><br\/>A number of later amendments deal with prudence in undertaking agricultural production.  I ask the Minister of State to accept amendment No. 22 in the spirit of the joint committee's document, which the former Minister, Commissioner Phil Hogan, gave a firm commitment to address.  The earth is a small place so this is an important matter.  As a trading nation, it is important for us that such countries will develop.  We cannot bury our heads in the sand and ignore what is happening to countries that are vulnerable to coastal flooding.  We cannot allow huge areas of their coastline to be washed away with chunks of their GDP being eaten up in providing flood prevention measures, not to mention the catastrophe on a human scale.  If their economies are wrecked in trying to deal with climate change, including the resettlement of people inland, they obviously will not have the money to trade with us.  Working with the Third World and building climate justice into the equation puts us in a moral position to trade with developing countries.  It will also enable them to have more cash to buy our goods and services.<br\/><br\/>These matters are inter-linked so the pieces of the jigsaw must fit together.  If we do not deal with climate justice many of the jigsaw pieces will be missing so the centre will not hold globally, either economically, socially or financially.  I therefore ask the Minister of State to accept my amendment in that spirit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900037#KK00300","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443551100,"counter":398,"content":"<p>As there are no other speakers on the Opposition side, I call the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900038#LL00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1443551100,"counter":399,"content":"<p>These amendments seek to include a reference to the principle of climate justice in either section 3 or section 4 of the Bill.

As I mentioned before, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform estimates that the cost to the Exchequer to purchase compliance will be billions of euro by 2030, in a business as usual scenario.  The point of these amendments is to put into law a system of accounting that will take into account the human and financial cost of action versus inaction on climate change.  This was apparently not done when the legislation was being drafted.<\/p>  <p>  According to the European Commission, early action on climate change will save lives and money.  The EU-wide cost of not adapting to climate change could reach at least &euro;100 billion per year by 2020, rising to &euro;250 billion a year by 2050.<\/p><p>Elaborating on the internationally accepted position that climate change poses a threat so serious that it could reverse the last 50 years of progress in global health and development, the Commission has said that climate action would bring benefits of &euro;38 billion a year in 2050 through reduced mortality caused by air pollution.  The World Health Organization has estimated that, considering only a few of the associated health risks and assuming continued progress in economic growth and health protection, climate change would still be likely to cause about 250,000 additional deaths per year by the 2030s.  A recent report by researchers at the International Monetary Fund identifies the omission of health damages from polluting fuels as the largest of the subsidies provided to global energy production and use, which will total US$5.3 trillion in 2015, which is more than the total health expenditure of all the world's governments.  How frightening is that.<\/p> <p> What is clear is that climate change and its causes are the greatest risks facing human health.  The purpose of the first amendment is to ensure that when making a climate change mitigation plan, the Government takes into account the dangers to the health of the people of Ireland posed by climate change and the associated costs to the health system.  It is obvious that fast and meaningful action on climate change will have economic benefits for Ireland but, more importantly, it will mean the Government cares about the well-being of people.  Failure to commit to targets and a fast-track of the mitigation plan will demonstrate that the opposite is the case.<\/p> <p> As I have outlined, there is a wealth of peer-reviewed research showing that climate change will result in astronomical costs to governments the world over.  There is also a long series of very coherent arguments from scientists, economists and international bodies that highlight the immense savings that will accrue from co-ordinated, effective and sustained commitment to ambitious emissions reductions targets.  In light of these facts, a situation where the Minister refuses to entertain amendments that would commit us to national emissions targets on the basis that to do so would incur a potential cost to the Exchequer is a bit mind-boggling.  This stance by the Minister is one of the starkest examples of the Government sticking its head in the sand on an issue.  This amendment would serve to at least remind the Government of the insanity of policy that falls short of being serious about tackling climate change.  <\/p> <p> A refusal to engage in joined-up thinking in here can be really frightening at times.  People who know more about this than we do are making it very clear that if we make long-term decisions rather than ones which go from election to election, we would address this, aside from showing concern for the future of the planet and any concern we might show for our children and their children.  If there is one thing that unites the 166 Deputies in here, it is that we all care about our offspring.  However, we are turning a blind eye to the problems facing our offspring and their offspring by refusing to do anything about it now.  <\/p> <p> It reminds me of the lack of joined-up thinking I have addressed a few times in here relating to the area of sport and health.  In 2013, alcohol abuse cost the State &euro;3.5 billion, tobacco abuse cost it &euro;1.3 billion and obesity cost it &euro;1.1 billion but the State gave sport &euro;90 million for the year.  Sport more than anything else challenges all these things and it would reduce abuses but we do not invest enough in all sports to do this.  This is about joined-up thinking and longer-term planning.  We would not see the results of it before the next election but we would see them in time and our children would certainly be beneficiaries of it, as would their children.  It is a pity that so much of politics is dictated by \"short termism\".  So much of business is now dictated by short-termism, particularly big business where it is more about shares, dividends and quick profits.  It is becoming very problematic for the world.  How we deal with climate change is another example of it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900038#LL00900","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443551700,"counter":407,"content":"<p>This proposed amendment appears out of place in section 2.
