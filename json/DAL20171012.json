Our new loan schemes are also being developed in the context of EU rules.  However, should the situation change, it may be important to negotiate some Brexit-related flexibility in state aid rules with the Commission.  It is also possible that, if the trading situation worsened, it might be necessary at that point to make a strong case to the Commission that flexibility on State aid is needed.

This report addresses the issues highlighted by Judge Aylmer in his ruling in the case of DPP <i>v .<\/i>Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick.  The report sets out the facts relating to the case and does not purport to be an investigation or an inquiry.  It covers the main issues directed at the ODCE by Judge John Aylmer in his ruling on 23 May 2017.  This includes the coaching of witness statements; late disclosure of documents; a perceived bias by ODCE investigators; and the shredding of documents.<\/p><p>I have sought the advice of the Attorney General, specifically as to whether there are any legal impediments to publishing the report and discussing its contents in the Oireachtas.  While it is crucial to identify and learn from any shortcomings in the investigative process in one particular trial, it is also important to recognise the very valuable role the ODCE has played, and continues to play, in facilitating compliance and enforcement of company law.  Between 2012 and 2016, investigations by the ODCE have resulted in the restriction of 886 company directors.  This means that they are prevented from being appointed or acting in any way as a director or secretary or being involved in the formation or promotion of any company unless it is adequately capitalised which, in the case of a public limited company other than an investment company, means a capital requirement of &euro;500,000 in allotted paid up share capital, and in the case of any other company, the capital requirement is &euro;100,000.  ODCE investigations in the same period also resulted in the disqualification of 65 directors by the High Court.  There have also been 971 instances of securing compliance with the Companies Act through the exercise of the director&rsquo;s civil powers.<\/p><p>With regard to the Deputy's question, I would like to publish the report.  It would be my intention to publish it, subject to ongoing clarification of the legal advice.  There are quite a number of parties involved in this, as the Deputy is aware, and a range of legal work needs to be done before I can get to that point.  The publication of the report will always be subject to the final advice of the Attorney General.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>Since the establishment of the ODCE, there has been a sharp increase in the restriction and disqualification of directors.  In 2004, only ten directors had been disqualified whereas by the end of 2016 that figure stood at 3,955.<\/p><p>The ODCE has also been successful in recent prosecutions.  In 2014, two people were convicted for the giving of unlawful financial assistance by Anglo for the purchase of its own shares.  In 2016, a person was convicted for fraudulent trading on foot of a plea of guilty.  In 2016, a person was convicted for failing to maintain a licensed bank&rsquo;s register of loans to directors on foot of a plea of guilty.  In late April of this year, a person was arrested and charged with fraudulent trading based on an invoice discounting fraud and entered a plea of guilty.  It is important that any actions we take are done with full knowledge and in line with fair procedures, due process and natural justice.  It is my intention to publish the report subject to the advice of the Attorney General.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200004#B00500","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1507799400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response.

Inclusive of growth in our urban areas, these measures will also focus very much on balanced regional development.<\/p>  <p>  The south-east action plan for jobs is the key policy response for supporting employment growth in the south-east region with public and private stakeholders actively engaged together to make progress on jobs.  The core objective of the plan is to see a further 25,000 at work in the region by 2020 and to reduce the unemployment rate to within 1% of the State average.  The first two progress reports on the implementation of the Action Plan for Jobs show that progress is being made.  I have had the opportunity to meet with the members of the action group.  I note that 13,000 jobs were created in the south east since the regional action plans for jobs initiative was launched and implemented in January 2015.  The unemployment rate in the south east has fallen from 12.8% in 2015 to 8.1% by the second quarter of 2017.  However, there is still work to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200005#C01000","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1507800000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Those responsible for the south-east area action plan for jobs briefed Oireachtas Members from the south east last Thursday.

The group is very concerned that the area has lagged behind historically and that unemployment levels in the region are the second highest nationally, while the region is second lowest in foreign direct investment.

High potential start-ups are similarly 4.5% as against a population of 11% in the region.  There is also, of course, a huge brain drain from the region with 67% of students leaving the region to study.  Unfortunately, 40% of them fail to return.

The fund has supported 3,145 jobs.  Support activity is widely distributed both by geography and sector.  Activity by county and industry is published in the quarterly reports.  I will send a copy of the quarter 2, 2017 report to both Deputies for their information.<\/p>  <p>  A total of 22% of all loan approvals have gone to Dublin; 16% to the south east; 13% to the Border region; 11% to the west; 11% to the mid-east; 10% to the south west; 8% to the mid-west and 9% to the midlands.<\/p>  <p>  The most popular sectors supported are wholesale-retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motor cycles at 22%, manufacturing at 12% and construction at 8%.<\/p>  <p>  There were 357 loans approved in 2015 totalling &euro;5.4 million, 397 loans approved in 2016 totalling &euro;5.4 million and 178 loans were approved up until the end of June this year totalling &euro;2.5 million.<\/p>  <p>  During 2015, in line with the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act 2012, the performance of MFI was reviewed in detail by my officials, and the implementation of changes led to better performance, flexibility and advertising of its products.  A key change was the removal of a previous requirement for a microenterprise to have been refused a bank loan before recourse to this channel.<\/p>  <p>  Microfinance Ireland is guided by its new strategy, The Way Forward 2017-2021.  At the centre of the new strategy is the strategic vision which provides for the need for MFI to create a value proposition by being the best in class micro-lender, creating and supporting jobs and fulfilling the borrowing requirements of microenterprises across Ireland.  The strategic vision also aims to exceed the strategic objective of the fund of supporting the creation of 7,700 jobs in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  This new strategy is bearing fruit as the organisation was recently awarded a certification of compliance with the European code of good conduct for micro credit provision.  This certification confirms MFI's position as a best in class micro credit provider in Europe, being one of the first institutions in Europe to qualify and the only organisation in Ireland to receive this award.<\/p>  <p>  With regards to loan guarantees, 108 facilities were sanctioned under the CGS in 2015 totalling &euro;20.4 million, 131 facilities sanctioned in 2016 totalling &euro;22.8 million and in 2017, up until the end of June of this year, 70 facilities have been sanctioned totalling &euro;9.2 million.<\/p>  <p>  The percentage of sanctioned lending breaks down as 55% to the east, 10.6% to the mid-west, 10.2% to the south west, 8% to the south east, 6.6% to the midlands, 5% to the west, 2.6% to the north east and 2% to the north west.<\/p>  <p>  The most popular sectors in receipt of support include information and communications technology at 20.8%, wholesale-retail trade and repairs at 16.8%, manufacturing at 13.9% and human health and social work at 9%.

Already the weakness of sterling has had negative impacts on those companies so there must be specific programmes of assistance to help the companies to try to maintain existing levels of employment and, where possible, to grow.

One of our core ways of dealing with the challenges in different areas is the action plans for jobs.  The north east-north west regional action plan is a key response to try to deal with the challenges and to support employment growth in the region.  Its aim is to support job creation across the region, including in counties Cavan and Monaghan, by ensuring there is collaboration between the public and private sectors and that Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and so forth are supporting that work.<\/p>  <p>  The core objective of the action plan is to have a further 28,000 at work in the region by 2020 and to ensure the unemployment rate is within the 1% of the State average.  The sectors being targeted include the traditionally strong sectors in the area such as agrifood, manufacturing, engineering and tourism.  The second progress report is being finalised and is about to be published.  Over 96% of the actions due to be completed under the plan have been done and 6,000 jobs were created in the Border area since the regional action plan for jobs initiative was launched in January 2015.  The unemployment rate in the region has fallen from 10.2% to 6.6%.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, we must continue this work but it is important to note that at this point in time live register numbers have fallen in County Cavan by 16.5% and in County Monaghan by 14% in the past 12 months.  That is good progress but we cannot be complacent given the challenges that may be ahead, particularly for the sectors that are reliant on the UK market.  Any changes in sterling would particularly affect them.  This is a key focus for Enterprise Ireland in working with clients and the sectors the Deputy mentioned.  The main message is to prepare for Brexit by business and by sector to ensure that firms can diversify and be supported in doing that.  EI has a plan in place to focus more on the eurozone and that means supporting the firms mentioned by the Deputy to diversify to the eurozone.  However, that will not be done overnight which is why a transitional phase in Brexit is very important.  That is why the supports that are available for firms must be used at this point.  This is what we probably should be doing anyway irrespective of Brexit, but there is a great deal of support available.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the regional enterprise development fund.  There was an announcement in the budget that the second tranche of that, &euro;25 million, will be available.  People can apply to that fund from January and decisions are currently being made in respect of the first tranche of that funding.  Regional development was one of the criteria that had to be taken into account so all parts of the country will benefit from the fund.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of firms that could be vulnerable in the context of Brexit and which need working capital, that is, firms that would be viable if they had access to capital in the short term, the Brexit loan scheme we have announced will be available to those firms in the Cavan, Monaghan and Border region as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200007#E00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1507801200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>We have had difficulty over the years in attracting foreign direct investment to the Border region.

The sectors about which I am concerned in particular are the agrifood, engineering and construction products sectors.  Many of them, thankfully, have developed on an all-Ireland basis.  They might have started in Cavan and Monaghan but they expanded and grew north of the Border.  Similarly, some companies that were established in the Six Counties have expanded their sites and processing facilities south of the Border.

Funding has been provided to Science Foundation Ireland for additional research centres, including the research centre announced in the budget.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that there is a need to drive up the innovation capability of Irish companies in order that they can compete internationally.  I would go so far as to say that if they do not innovate and diversity, Irish companies will find it difficult to compete in the current trading environment.  Advance manufacturing centres have an important role in allowing manufacturing companies to adapt to new technologies, which are dramatically changing the face of manufacturing.<\/p>  <p>  While the benefits of innovation to firms in terms of increasing new products and services are well understood, innovation can involve upfront expenditure.  As the Deputy pointed out, this can impact on cashflow for firms.  The research and development tax credit specifically recognises this issue and has been improved to help address this cashflow issue for companies.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland operates a range of supports to help companies mitigate the issues associated with undertaking innovation by providing funding and support to undertake these activities in-house, where appropriate, or helping them to engage with third level researchers. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland's innovation supports help companies of all scales and capability levels.  Even the smallest firm can avail of an innovation voucher, with 418 such projects completed to date under this scheme.  They can also engage with academic research groups which are aligning more closely with industry and business.  Enabling small companies to make links with the various research centres is a positive development.  We are seeing very positive engagement in the manufacturing centres.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200008#F00800","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1507801800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste referred to Innovation 2020.  I am very concerned about progress on this strategy, although I acknowledge that it is a national strategy and my question is directed at a lower level.  We learned during the week that Ireland spends approximately 1.45% of GDP on research and development whereas the figure is supposed to be 2.5%.  I am very concerned about this.  I reviewed Innovation 2020 last night and we are very far from meeting the objectives set out in the strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste also referred to Science Foundation Ireland's research centres and the funding provided in the budget for a new research centre.  While these centres do great work, they are not applicable to small business, which is the focus of my question. <\/p>  <p>  I met representatives of the Small Firms Association and ISME recently.  As a former chairman of a small business association, I know that small firms find it difficult to access supports, particularly high-level supports such as Science Foundation Ireland's research centres and fiscal measures such as the research and development tax credit and knowledge box tax credit, to which I had amendments made earlier in the year.  We must try to assist small businesses to avail of these schemes.  Small business groups inform me that while such initiatives are fantastic and make sense, large companies with significant reserves can take the risk of receiving a tax credit or having a tax audit done in later in the year, which may involve a clawback.  However, a small firm struggling daily with cashflow will find it much more difficult to do this because it cannot risk this type of capital expenditure upfront in uncertain circumstances.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200008#F00900","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1507802400,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I take the Deputy's point about companies taking the risk of putting time and money into innovation.  We have an important role to play in supporting companies in that regard.  Many companies tell me they get so caught up in their challenging day-to-day work that it is difficult to take any time out to innovate.  Sometimes, companies do not use the available range of supports.  We need to publicise further the research and development fund as well as the innovative high-potential startup fund, which has received a large allocation from Enterprise Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  While I take the Deputy's point that the big research centres are more connected to large-scale business, there is potential for collaboration.  Enterprise Ireland will connect companies with particular researchers and institutes in order to develop their products, and its commercialisation fund provides supports for academic researchers to pursue research outputs with commercial potential.  There are a number of schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Cashflow can be an issue for firms undertaking research and development.

I will propose two potential practical solutions if the T&aacute;naiste is minded to adopt or consider them, the first of which addresses difficulties experienced by small firms.  Some of these can be startup enterprises of one to ten people, so we are not discussing established companies with capital and reserves.  Under the JobsPlus scheme, a person is hired from the live register and the employing company receives a cash credit for every month that he or she remains in employment.  Would the Department consider an \"R&amp;DPlus\" scheme?  Along similar lines as JobsPlus, where demonstrable innovation takes place, an actual cash credit or financial advance would be made to the company to support that work.  It is a real measure and companies would not have to wait until the end of the year or face the uncertainty of it being clawed back.  Rather, they could avail of it in the same way that employers do under JobsPlus.<\/p>  <p>  My second proposal is the idea of a mentoring scheme in which lean processing, such as Lean Six Sigma, and other advanced business practices can be brought to bear on smaller companies that may not be aware or availing of them.  This could be done simply and cheaply.  It would involve pairing up retired industrialists with SMEs in their sectors through local enterprise offices, LEOs, and education and training boards, ETBs.

The budget has allocated &euro;4 million for it.  It promotes a transfer of knowledge between Ireland's public knowledge providers and small business companies.  Vouchers worth &euro;5,000 each are provided to enable small businesses to seek assistance, be it in terms of skill or knowledge, from publicly funded researchers to address problems or proposals in respect of their business activities.  This could be an important initiative for the small businesses of up to ten employees that the Deputy mentioned.  It is meant to get them started.  They may have ideas about how to innovate or diversify their businesses but do not know where to start.  The innovation voucher is useful, but somewhat underused.  It is important, in that it helps smaller companies to deal with the cashflow issues the Deputy mentioned.

The North East-North West action plan for jobs is the key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Border region, including Donegal.  We have seen the unemployment rate in the Border region fall from 10.2% in the first quarter of 2015 to 6.6%.

In 2015 and 2016, there were 11 IDA Ireland visits to the county while in the same period there were 446 in Dublin.  Just two of the approximately 600 new companies that have come to the country in the past nine years have come to Donegal.  Existing companies in the county, such as Optum and Pramerica, do well and continue to bring in new employment but we are not being prioritised by IDA Ireland for new employment.

Donegal is now home to 12 IDA Ireland companies, employing 3,039 employees.  That is important.  It is a 37% increase since 2012.  There are things happening and there are improvements.  One can see that from the employment figures for Donegal.  It is a 37% increase.  It is important.

The Deputy should be absolutely clear that IDA Ireland is focused on regional development.  We can work so far in terms of supporting a company to go into a regional area but at the end of the day the company decides where it wants to locate.  What all of us working together have to do is make sure our regions are in a position to continue to attract and support foreign direct investment.

It is something the Minister needs to address.  Companies such as Optum and Pramerica, which are growing, came to the county in the 1990s and 2000s and grew from there but we are not getting new investment by new companies.  They are not coming and we need to get our fair share of that.  It comes down to the Minister with responsibility and the Government driving it.  There is no point in telling us there is a policy of regional development when it is quite clear the policy is failing and not happening on the ground.  We need it to be addressed by the Minister.  On the threat Brexit poses to our county, the fact our economy is so dependent on Northern Ireland plays a big part in that.

The T&aacute;naiste will recall that back in 2012 the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, introduced the averaging rule in respect of the calculation of a person's entitlement to the State pension.  Yesterday, the Minister of Finance, Deputy Donohoe, participated in the annual phone-in radio programme with Se&aacute;n O'Rourke on RT&Eacute; and it was quite revealing.  He was challenged by a caller from County Longford who outlined his wife's situation.  She had entered the work force as a student and then taken a number of years out to be a homemaker and to raise her family.  She had also been disbarred from working in the Civil Service because of the State ban on married female civil servants.  She is now being financially discriminated against and disadvantaged to the tune of &euro;35 per week, which amounts to almost &euro;1,800 per annum.  She is not even entitled to the increase which was announced in the budget.  When challenged, the Minister's reply was that he found the situation to be bonkers and unbelievable.<\/p>  <p>  To say that people are outraged at this, as well as at the Minister's reaction and comment, would be an understatement.  It is inconceivable that the Minister for Finance would react like that without having anything substantial to offer these people who are being blatantly discriminated against by the State.  It is a shameful indictment of the decision made by the Government of the day, to which the T&aacute;naiste, her colleagues and the Labour Party were party.  <\/p>  <p>  As a former leading light in the National Women's Council of Ireland, the T&aacute;naiste will have heard its comments and how it has been campaigning and reacting in this regard.  Age Action Ireland also lobbied Oireachtas Members on a number of fronts in advance of the budget.  My own party, other parties and individual Deputies have been raising this issue in recent years.  Apart from platitudes and soundbites from the Minister, such as those he gave yesterday during his interview with Sean O'Rourke when challenged quite succinctly, what exactly do the T&aacute;naiste and the Government intend to do to address this blatant inequality?  It is gender-based inequality in the main because it impacts on women, as I have said.  It must be borne in mind that many women took time out of the workforce to rear their families, to look after sick relatives or elderly parents and to look after their homemaking responsibilities.

We had extensive discussion on this as we formulated the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020, which I published in May of this year.  The actions in that strategy include increasing women's access to pensions in their own right, improving their access to private and occupational pensions and assessing the impact any future reforms to pension policy in this area will have on women and taking actions if appropriate.  That has been accepted by the Government in the national strategy in respect of dealing with this issue.  In line with the national strategy the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and I also launched a public consultation on tackling the gender pay gap in August.  We need to drive a whole-of-Government agenda to deal with these gender pay issues, including the pension issue, female entrepreneurship, child care, skills, STEM subjects and so on.<\/p>  <p>  This is clearly a complex issue.

It is a complex issue to resolve in the sense that we do not want to create any new anomalies which would discriminate against people who have a contribution history.  The current rate plans applying to the contributory State pension were introduced with effect from September 2012 and reduced the previous rates which had been introduced in 2000.<\/p><p>These rate bands now reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person more closely than those that were in place between 2000 and 2012.  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in a cost of more than &euro;60 million in 2018, which would increase by an estimated &euro;10 million in each following year.  It would be expected to cost some &euro;70 million in 2019.  Spending this money on reverting to the old rates would not generally benefit the worst-off pensioners who are dependent upon the State pension.  This is because the main beneficiaries would be those who have other income means such that they do not qualify for a non-contributory pension, which is 95% of the contributory pension.  Given that the funds would come from the general pension provision, less well-off pensioners could expect to be worse off if such a course were taken.<\/p> <p> The savings created by the new rate bands were an alternative to cutting the core rate of pensions at a time when Exchequer savings were required and other social protection payments were being reduced across the board.  Had a similar approach been taken with pensions, affecting everyone over State pension age regardless of their means or their contribution record, the hardest hit would have been pensioners with no additional income, notably those paid a non-contributory State pension and widows and widowers living alone.  A significantly higher portion of such pensioners are women and this approach would have been expected to result in more women over 65 experiencing difficulties in terms of income.<\/p> <p> It is a complex issue and to resolve it is between &euro;200 million and &euro;300 million overall.  We do not want to see gender discrimination and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is having ongoing discussions with the Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200012#K00800","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507804800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>It is just not good enough for the T&aacute;naiste to come in here and say that this is a complex issue.

The years they were not in the workforce are being used to average down their contributions.  There is nothing complex about that.  It is just pure discrimination.  It has got to be fixed.

As has been said, 35,000 people have been left with a lesser pension payment than they would have received had they retired before 2012.  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, this is the result of measures introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, which changed eligibility criteria.  Deputy Burton's decision made it more difficult for those without an unbroken, full-time, long-term work history to qualify for the maximum payment.  The changes to the bands in addition to the averaging rule regarding PRSI contributions were completely unfair and have had an absolutely disproportionate impact on women, many of whom left the workforce to raise children or to care for their families.

It was a conscious decision.  The current Government continues to make decisions against the welfare of these women.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has described the situation as bonkers and unbelievable.  What is really bonkers and unbelievable is that he drafted and announced a budget on Tuesday that does absolutely nothing to rectify this matter.  I suppose that comes as no surprise.

The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely matched to contributions made by a person.

Connected to that is the issue of the European Union-Mercosur trade deal.<\/p>  <p>  Agriculture is Ireland's largest indigenous sector with over 300,000 people employed directly or indirectly in the agrifood sector.  County Tipperary has a proud tradition of excellence in the agrifood sector with many famous brands produced in the county.  The Tipperary Food Producers organisation is a community of SMEs working in the agrifood sector in the county, showcasing the best of Tipperary food, with over 30 members producing quality artisan products such as Cashel Blue Cheese, Crossogue Preserves, Lough Derg Chocolates, Crowe's Farm bacon and many others.

Third level fees skyrocketed, there were cutbacks to unemployment benefits for those under 25 and youth services were cut to the bone.  The message of successive Governments, first that of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party and then that of Fine Gael and Labour, was that the country could not afford young people and perhaps they could try their luck elsewhere.  As a result, tens of thousands of people, including dozens I grew up with, left for Western Australia, Canada, London, the United States and countless other places.  Those left behind faced unemployment or underemployment and miserly supports if they could not find a job.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is fond of telling the House of his republic of opportunity.  Young people do not want a hand-out or any special pleading but only the opportunity to have a decent standard of living.  However, my generation is being denied the opportunities that previous generations took for granted.  There was little in the budget to convince those who travelled to the four corners of the world there is anything in this republic of opportunity for them to come home to.  Some 15,000 students marched outside Leinster House last week seeking respite from the crippling fees that are discouraging many from pursuing the education that could give them real opportunities.  However, the Government appears deaf to their demands.  The Government also appears to be militantly opposed to equal pay for equal work for young workers in the public sector.

The budget contained the highest-ever allocation for education, involving an increase of &euro;554 million or 5.8% to more than &euro;10 billion.  It provided for 2,000 new teachers and special needs assistants.  Overall Government investment increased by more than &euro;1 billion in budgets 2017 and 2018.  We have moved from having an unemployment rate of more than 15% to full employment being expected next year.  That is a message of hope for the children in the country and for the people who left the country, many of whom, thankfully, are returning to take up the jobs the Government is ensuring are available.

If that is so, it has surely failed in that there will be no new social housing beyond what has been already announced and, incredibly, literally nothing on affordable housing.  This is a hammer blow to the ambitions of thousands.  This is a huge category of people, ranging from those in the tech professions in Dublin to tradespeople in Limerick.  It is a wide variety of people from all sorts of backgrounds who are unable to qualify for social housing and cannot get mortgages, and this Government is doing literally nothing for them.  They come to my clinics and ask me what options they have.  They have none, and this Government is doing nothing about it.  It made an announcement about the possibility of an affordable housing scheme this year.  There was nothing in this budget on that.  For seven years Fine Gael has been in Government.  The Government talks about working families.  That is absolute cant to those who are simply paying a fortune on rent and have no prospect-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200016#O00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1507806600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I call the T&aacute;naiste to respond.

It is a day of increasing importance, given the explosion of reported mental health problems in Ireland and right around the world.  The World Health Organization estimates that by 2030, depression will be the largest contributor to disease burden.  In Ireland, at least one in four people will have a mental health problem in the course of their lives, and for young people the figures are even more striking.  By the age of 13, one in three young people will have experienced a mental health problem.  By the age of 24, that will have increased to more than one in two.  Tragically, Ireland now has the highest rate of child suicide of girls in Europe, and ten people die by suicide every week in Ireland.  Why is this massive rise taking place?  It partly relates to a reduction in stigma surrounding mental health and, therefore, a rise in reporting.  However, it is also hard to avoid the conclusion that we face an epidemic of mental health problems or, as Mark Fisher put it, a mental health plague.  There are multiple contributing factors but there is increasing recognition of the role of social and environmental factors.  To be blunt, neoliberal capitalism has created a society with deepened, dramatic inequality.  It has driven the atomisation of people and the breakdown of communities.  These are the conditions in which, unfortunately, mental health problems thrive.  The Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK reported that inequality is a major determinant of mental illness.  The greater the level of inequality, the worse the health outcomes.  Children from the poorest households have a threefold greater risk of mental ill health than children from the richest households.  This risk is particularly strong for those facing homelessness.  A new study reveals the results for both parents and children are devastating and lifelong.  The risk is strong for those facing oppression such as young LGBTQ people, who are four times more likely to have mental health problems, and Traveller communities, which face suicide rates six times those of settled communities.<\/p>  <p>  What needs to be done about this?  The stigma needs to be taken out of mental ill health.  We need to fight fundamentally for a society without alienation and in which people do meaningful work, have control over their lives and are connected to others in their communities.  We need proper funding and staffing of mental health services right now.  We need universal access to counsellors in primary care and 24-7 direct-access mental health clinics supported by round-the-clock telephone support, but we do not have this.  We had A Vision for Change in 2006, which still has not been implemented.  The Government's announcement in the budget of &euro;35 million extra was not honest because &euro;20 million of that was announced last year.  It is an additional &euro;15 million.  I know the Government sent a letter this morning to Mental Health Reform stating that the money will be given and that A Vision for Change will be implemented, but I do not see the figures adding up.  It is stated in the confidence and supply arrangement that A Vision for Change will be implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200016#O01900","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1507806600,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Deputy Murphy will have another minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200016#O02000","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1507806600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>The Government has only one more budget in which to do this.

I absolutely accept the point Deputy Murphy makes in this regard because of the personal cost and the societal cost of mental health issues and the personal suffering.  As a Government, we want to support in whatever way we can the development of proper mental health services throughout the country.  A Vision for Change is the blueprint on which the Government is working.  The funding has been increased substantially over the years, with more than &euro;900 million in 2018 going on mental health services.  The issue to which the Deputy refers is new funding for mental health services, and budget 2018 allocates an additional &euro;35 million to develop mental health services in 2018.  The figures published are accurate.  The Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health have also committed an additional &euro;55 million in funding for 2019.  This means a total of &euro;105 million in additional funding for the implementation of A Vision for Change, which is due for review.<\/p>  <p>  A review is ongoing because the policy is many years old.  That total of &euro;105 million in additional funding for the implementation of A Vision for Change over the three-year period 2017 to 2019 and that extra &euro;35 million will help build on the work that was commenced in 2017 on the enhancement of what we need, namely, community care teams for children and adults, later life and mental health care, and intellectual disability services.  It will also help to continue our move towards a full 24-7 service, with an initial focus on increasing the provision of services on a seven-day-week basis.  The HSE has been asked to prioritise this in 2018.  The mental health budget will rise from &euro;711 million in 2012 to over &euro;912 million in 2018.  This is an increase of 28% in six years.<\/p>  <p>  If the budget shows our values in terms of putting more money into mental health care, it is very clear that we absolutely recognise the need to increase the budget to have a proper mental health service for all our population throughout the country.  The overall increase in 2018 in mental health spending will be just under &euro;60 million when the &euro;35 million for service development is combined with the &euro;24 million in additional funding for pay increases.  In finalising the HSE national service plan, there may be some adjustments to these figures to take account of procurement savings or other HSE-wide efficiency initiatives.<\/p><p>The budget will increase and fund more staffing in CAMHS, adult psychiatry and later life psychiatry.  In addition, further resources will be provided to programmes for eating disorders, dual diagnosis, mental health of homeless people, perinatal mental health, prison inreach services, mental health and intellectual disabilities services and service users' participation.  We can see there are significant increases this year, next year and the following year which meet fully the commitment for that &euro;35 million per year.  The total that has been decided will ensure the implementation of A Vision for Change is allowed for in those years.  As the Deputy said, that has been given in writing to the HSE by the Minister, who has asked it to make sure it starts the staff recruitment that is necessary to have that development of the services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200016#O02200","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507807200,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Some 20% to 25% of overall ill health is caused by mental health problems but less than 7% of the health budget is going on mental health.  The Government has played with figures.  It played with figures last year in terms of mental health and has done the same in this budget, as opposed to properly allocating the funding to bring us up to the percentage levels that apply in other European countries.  The latest figures this morning still do not make sense.  There is an answer in the D&aacute;il record in July from the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, stating that just to meet the staffing gap in order to meet A Vision for Change requirements would cost an extra &euro;128 million in a year.  If we accept the &euro;35 million figure, that would still require an increase for the next budget of &euro;90 million, and that applies without dealing with any of the capital costs.  To actually implement A Vision for Change, if the Government is not going to do it next year and will instead do it in 2019, it would need to allocate an additional &euro;150 million next year.  I do not see the Government doing that, although it should.  The Government should spell out how the figures match up.

Obviously, that has already started for 2017, 2018 and 2019.<\/p>  <p>  That is what it has been estimated it will cost but the Deputy should bear in mind what I have said, which is that this is just part of the funding for mental health services.

There is a very serious commitment to the development of mental health services, although we also need to review A Vision for Change and that review is under way, as I have said.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, have written to the Mental Health Reform group confirming an increased allocation for mental health over the three-year period, 2017-19, and they will meet that group, which does such excellent work, in the near future to discuss plans for mental health.

As has already been advised by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, Tuesday's budget will for the first time in ten years balance the national books and it does so while primarily supporting young families, improving people&rsquo;s lives, safeguarding our national finances and investing in our country's future.  This milestone should not be overlooked when considering where we have come from in terms of the levels of borrowing needed to run our country.  In many ways, it really is the end of the forgotten decade of cuts, forced emigration and austerity which followed the economic crash in 2008.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, this budget is a safe and modest expansionary budget which will see &euro;1.2 billion in spending and tax cuts being implemented.  We will spend &euro;60.5 billion as a country in 2018 but we are sticking to the careful approach we have taken with regard to public spending since 2011.  This careful approach has helped us to reduce the risk of future financial crises being homemade.  It has helped us to regain our feet following the crash and I am glad to see it continue in this budget.  The boom to bust policies of the past have wrecked this country time and again and we do not want to see them return.<\/p>  <p>  On the ground in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, this budget will have a wide range of benefits across local communities.  For example, social welfare spending is up by &euro;260 million, which means there will be a &euro;260 a year increase across the board for all weekly payments from March 2018, including for carers, pensioners, jobseekers and the disabled in Sligo, Leitrim, south Donegal and north Roscommon.  The Christmas bonus has also been retained at 85%.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to personal taxation and rewarding work, this budget will ensure that middle income workers are modestly rewarded by ensuring that the point at which an income earner will pay the higher rate of tax is increased by &euro;750 to &euro;34,550.  We will also reduce the rates of USC and increase the subsequent bands to ensure that all workers who will receive the increased minimum wage of &euro;9.65 from January will not pay increased USC as a result.  This is the fourth budget under Fine Gael in which the marginal rate of taxation has been reduced and it will continue to drop under our stewardship.<\/p>  <p>  In health, we will see more nurses hired to work on the front line of our hospitals in Sligo, Leitrim and south Donegal.  Some 1,800 will be hired nationally, with the health budget to be increased by &euro;685 million to &euro;15.3 billion.  Prescription charges for the over-70s will be reduced from &euro;2.50 to &euro;2 and a new telephone support of &euro;104 per year will also be introduced.  There will also be a reduction in the threshold for the drugs payment scheme from &euro;144 to &euro;134.<\/p>  <p>  In housing, additional resources are being allocated to fast-track the building of the local authority housing stock nationally and, in particular, in Sligo and Leitrim.  This has further been supported by an increase in the funding for the housing assistance payment.<\/p>  <p>  In education, this budget will deliver an additional 1,300 teaching posts in schools in 2018, along with an additional 1,000 special needs assistants in time for September 2018, bringing the total number of SNAs to over 15,000.  This measure will ensure that the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level in schools in Sligo, Leitrim and south Donegal will be reduced to 26:1 for the first time in the history of the State.<\/p>  <p>  The budget will also see the recruitment of a further 800 garda&iacute; and 500 civilian staff in 2018, which will mean more garda&iacute; on our streets and villages.  Funding has also been ring-fenced for large Garda infrastructural projects, such as the new Sligo regional garda headquarters, with a site location expected to be disclosed shortly by the OPW.<\/p>  <p>  The N4 Collooney to Castlebaldwin road upgrade, mentioned on page 135 of the expenditure report, will continue to be funded, with an overall tender expected to be ready to go by the end of 2018.  I await the statements from the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The earned income tax credit will be increased by &euro;200 to further support our SMEs.<\/p><p>There is a new &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme to support SMEs in accessing finance during the difficulties which Brexit will present.<br\/><br\/>In agriculture, a major industry in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, there will be a comprehensive &euro;50 million Brexit response package announced for 2018, along with a specific &euro;25 million agrifood loan scheme to assist with Brexit related issues.<br\/><br\/>I was also lobbied hard by farmers from the region about the areas of natural constraint scheme, ANC, and I am glad to learn that this fund will be increased by &euro;25 million 2018.  I am, however, quite concerned about the fact that, as it stands, the 6% stamp duty for agriculture land sales applies and I believe that this needs to be changed in the Finance Bill.<br\/><br\/> I welcome this safe and modest budget for 2018 and I also welcome the ever improving financial situation which we have faced since Fine Gael has taken power and I look forward to more positive budgets in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200017#P00900","speaker":"1343","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507807800,"counter":200,"content":"<p>First I must say that I am unhappy with the time allocation.  I respect everyone here but backbenchers like me would like to speak for longer than the four minutes and five seconds that I have left, notwithstanding the fact that most of my speaking will be praising the Government.<\/p>  <p>  Significant changes have been made in Ireland's unemployment figures, especially in Louth where there has been a 16% drop in the last year.  This is very welcome indeed.  Lots more families are working and family income is going up.  Older people will have an increase in their pensions.  Disability allowances and benefits will increase.<\/p>  <p>  There is increasing confidence in Ireland.  Having come through the roughest of times and the most difficult of times, particularly for poorer families and those who lost their jobs, there is confidence that Ireland is undeniably and absolutely on the right course.  I very much welcome the decisions that the Government has made in the budget.  It is a sign of the times and is the way things are moving forward incrementally.<\/p>  <p>  In education I welcome the reduction in the pupil teacher ratio, especially as it relates to younger students.  They will learn more and learn better if classes are smaller.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the commitment made in the budget to the Laytown-Bettystown link road, approval for which was given in 2016.  This will commence as soon as the approvals are sought.  I am disappointed that the Ardee bypass has not been announced, and Deputy Breathnach had better back me on this.  It is very badly needed.  The town of Ardee is expected to double in size.  The capacity of the sewerage system there has been increased from 5,000 to 10,000 population equivalents.  Over the next years Ardee town is going to grow phenomenally.  If we do not have the western bypass of Ardee then the town will come to a shuddering and unacceptable halt.  I want to make it clear that people are very unhappy with this.  It is the view of my constituents and it is my view and, as everybody knows, councillor Dolores Minogue will be very cross until this bypass is announced.  She is a very active campaigner who lives in the town.<\/p>  <p>  The biggest need in the State is housing.  I welcome the significant increase in the budget for housing.  I am, however, disappointed that the empty homes tax was not included in the budget.  It ought to have been included and it is essential that it happens, even though there might be a dispute over the numbers of houses that may or may not be vacant.  There is undeniably a significant number of houses in rent pressure zone areas that are empty, have been empty for more than one year and are not principal private residences.  We are definitely encouraging the owners to let the houses through an additional allowance in the budget relating to pre-letting costs.  More pressure could be put on those who do not need the homes for themselves so the houses could be put on the market and made available for families who are living in hostels and hotels.<\/p>  <p>  The Ardee bypass and the empty homes tax are the key minuses I see in this budget.  They should have been included.  I do, however, welcome the progress that has been made.  County Louth has benefitted significantly from the return to economic prosperity.  My concerns about the Border and about Brexit are shared by the Government and by all Deputies in the House.  I hope that the impact of Brexit, no matter how soft it might be, will not have a negative impact on our local economy.  I welcome the Government's line that it is up to the British Government to define and defend its proposals.  It is not Ireland's job to find the solution for them.  The answer is that there must be no Border.  For our economy North and South to continue to grow, Northern Ireland must remain part of the common travel area and must remain part of the customs union. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200018#Q00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1507807800,"counter":201,"content":"<p>This could be called the Mary Poppins budget.

Fianna F&aacute;il will aim to ensure that this year&rsquo;s HSE service plan will reflect our priorities in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Consider occupational therapy in Louth where there is a severe staffing problem.  Three therapists are on maternity leave and there have been no replacements.  Severe staffing shortages in critical areas right across all sectors, be it education, health or the local authority, will inflict damage in trying to create what the economy needs across these sectors.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the extra funding for the NTPF and that it is being greatly increased to try to deal with the severe numbers of people on hospital waiting lists.  I ask the Government and the Department of Health to examine further the cross Border health care initiative.  I believe this is not promoted properly and that many people in doctors' surgeries are not even aware of it or that they can avail of it.<\/p>  <p>  Many people will say they are happy with the price increase on cigarettes.  I have no difficulty with that because it is a good health measure.  I have been working with Retailers Against Smuggling and any further increases in the price of tobacco products will further exacerbate the increasing smuggling problem and cross Border trade.  This will impact on retailers and small shops south of the Border and in the major city areas where there is widespread sale of illegal cigarettes.  Ireland already has the most expensive alcohol and tobacco products in the EU and further increases in excise will only serve to drive trade across the Border where they are likely to buy other products besides cigarettes such as alcohol.  This will detract from the trade of our business people right along the spine of the Border.  In this context I encourage the Government to bring forward the Sale of Illicit Goods Bill 2017, which I introduced on First Stage in the D&aacute;il.  It is more important than ever that this Bill would go to Second Stage and be teased out, especially in the light of Brexit.<\/p><p>As I said yesterday when speaking on the financial measures in the budget, its shaky cornerstone is stamp duty on commercial property.  While I recognise in particular that there are concessions for young farmers in the consanguinity rights on transactions, small to medium farmers buying lands to expand their farms should get a concession in any discussion post budget.  All one has to do is look at the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>today to see the angst and concern arising from this issue.<br\/><br\/>The housing measures which have been announced are repetitive.<b><\/b>We heard about many of them before the budget, in which they are simply contained.  In that context, I commend Fianna F&aacute;il's Vacant Housing Refurbishment Bill 2017.I am concerned that we have in excess of 2,500 civil parishes in rural Ireland in which there are up to ten rural properties, respectively, which could be brought back into use.  There are thousands of properties out there that could be brought into use through a little bit of concession in county development plans.  It should be possible to explore the technological solutions in particular for properties on less than half an acre.  My experience in a local authority context is that one cannot build unless one has a half-acre site, but most of these properties could be brought back into use with a little bit of ingenuity around technology.<br\/><br\/>The reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio to 26:1 is most welcome.  However, we have to be straight up with parents and acknowledge that this includes resource teachers.  There will still be classes of up to 30 pupils at any one time.<br\/><br\/>Increased funding for low-income farmers through the areas of natural constraint scheme and low-interest loan packages is welcome but the increase in the earned-income tax credit does not go far enough and continues to discriminate against self-employed workers as against PAYE workers.<br\/><br\/>I ask the Government to ring-fence a percentage of funds for tertiary or third class roads.  In many counties, including my own, not one penny has been spent on local authority roads which are culs-de-sac.  While we have introduced an LIS scheme which is most welcome, it is only for non-county roads.  As such, we need to deal with it.<br\/><br\/>Fianna F&aacute;il's input has made this a fairer budget.  We would like to see greater spending, but there are many in the House who hurl on the ditch while failing to participate in government.  They will promise the sun, moon and stars, but one will have to go up for those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200018#Q00300","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1507808400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Finnish Delegation","time":1507808400,"counter":204,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200019#R00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1507808400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Before proceeding with the Order of Business, I extend on behalf of the Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and myself a most sincere welcome to a delegation from the Finnish Parliament, the Eduskunta, led by Mr. Ari Jalonen, chairman of its Transport and Communications Committee.

The budget was to see the fulfilment of promises made again and again in the most public and high profile way to put culture at the centre of Government and public life.  It was to be a real beginning of a new era, not simply in terms of financial allocation, but in terms of political prioritisation and, above all, real respect.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Ross, if he has time to listen to me.  It is very important for the arts.  This is a huge portfolio on which a lot of people depend.  At the heart of the issue of how this budget is being received by artists is not money, rather it is respect.  During the recession, cuts came and artists bore them.  Arts organisations made do with less, but got on with it regardless.<\/p><p>Being an artist is not a job.  It is not a career.  It is a vocation.  One does not give one's life to art to make money; one makes art for life.  It is the innate drive that inspires every artist.  In experiment, failure and, occasionally, in success, astonishing works of art are made.  Arts and culture are essential to living a full life and they have much to offer our communities.  Ultimately, they make for a better society.  Arts and culture are essential to positive citizenship and give language to thoughts we otherwise could not articulate.  In D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann today, we are speaking of the economy.  Behind this budget are volumes of reports and years of events.  Can anyone think, however, of a more profound or truer summary of the recession we went through and what led to it than Donal Ryan's great book, <i>The Spinning Heart<\/i>?  In this decade of commemoration, has any history been written that equals, let alone surpasses, Se&aacute;n O'Casey's trilogy of great history plays?  Where else but in art, song, fiction, visual art, music and dance can we really find the means to articulate great joy or awful grief?  Art is essential to citizenship, but we cannot articulate what we really feel and think about it.  It is essential for life.<\/p><p>The expectations of artists around this budget were based on the belief in promises solemnly made and that the Government too shared this profound sense of the vitality and potential of art, and of culture more widely, in our life.  The expectation was that a fractured, almost broken relationship, was to be repaired.  The expectation was that Government had at least listened to and genuinely heard the real pain within the arts, not just as to monetary cuts, but on foot of a sense of disrespect.  The expectation was that bygones would be bygones.  The expectation was that there would be a new beginning.  These expectations were not just about money, but, much more importantly, about real feeling and genuine respect.  This was expected to be, at last, a new and happy day.It was not to be.  The bare fact of budget 2018 is that the allocation has not matched the announcement.  The deeper truth is that artists feel, yet again, that they have been used as a platform and a backdrop to enlarge a State that has little or no real feeling or respect for them at all.<\/p><p>In the summer of 2014, there was a sudden and unexpected promise of a national cultural policy.  Years have gone by, but nothing has appeared.  The promise of a national cultural policy was, in any event, overtaken by the plan for Creative Ireland.  This great public brand-making and festival of announcements, glossy documents and videos would be the vehicle and the means to put culture at the centre of national life.  Some were concerned that against an insidious use of the arts as backdrop for political projects, Creative Ireland had no clear or effective governance.  There was no transparency about how spending decisions were made.  The Minister will recall that I asked, on many occasions, how the allocation for 2017 could be accessed by arts organisations, whether there was an applications process and what were the criteria.  There were none.  There was only a political project, albeit one that held out hope and which promised an enlarged budget.  We waited, but we have been disappointed and artists are dismayed.  The chair of the Arts Council spoke for all when she expressed her deep disappointment at the paltry increase for the council, which is the main and essential support for the arts in Ireland.  The council's grant for 2018 will go from &euro;65 million to &euro;68 million, which is stand-still money representing an unrealised expectation.  The announcement of Creative Ireland remains just that, an announcement.  It now lies with the national cultural policy in a field of unrealised expectation.<\/p><p>I will not use my own words, but will quote instead words used by the National Campaign for the Arts, or NCFA:<\/p><blockquote>The National Campaign for the Arts today expressed deep disappointment at the minimal increases for the sector in Budget 2018.  This is despite the Government greatly raising expectations in the last year through its high-level initiative Creative Ireland whose stated aim is to raise the priority of arts, culture and creativity across Government, and the Taoiseach's campaign pledge to double investment in the sector.<\/blockquote><p>This is not political comment.  It is a real reaction and it conveys genuine hurt.  The NCFA went on to say:<\/p><blockquote>Budget allocations to key organisations are modest, in particular the Arts Council moving from &euro;65 million to &euro;68 million, an uplift of just 5% compared to last year's increase of 8%, and equally disappointing in percentage terms compared to Culture Ireland&rsquo;s increase from &euro;3.5 million to &euro;4 million and the Irish Film Board from &euro;16.5 million to &euro;18 million.  These figures fall far below expectations.<\/blockquote><p>They are the bare facts but they do not convey the sense of hurt and disbelief at broken promises.  The arts today remain on the sideline; they are not at the centre.  There is a fundamental attitude of disrespect.  The Government parties see the arts as an occasionally useful platform, but have no fundamental regard or feeling for them at all.<\/p> <p> Those at the centre of the Creative Ireland project are now at the centre of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s political communications project in Government Buildings.  It was a seamless passage and an apt one.  From attempting to undermine the independence of the national cultural institutions, to promising a national cultural policy as a diversion, to creating Creative Ireland as a cadet school for the biggest show in town, which is Government Buildings, there is a consistent train of thought.  It is of the artist as an extra in a world that sees politics as show business, and in which the ultimate political aspiration is to be star of your own movie.  The multiple video clips of Ministers \"performing\" as politicians over the past few days was a cartoon of politics.  It is a caricature of what was promised to artists and the creative industries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200019#R00900","speaker":"1271","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507809000,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Budget 2018, like any budget, presented choices to Government.  Those choices centred around how best to distribute available resources.  It was clear in the run-up to this budget that there were not significant resources to be spent but, nevertheless, we must always endeavour to spend what is available in the fairest way.  However, much of the conversation by the Government in the run-up to this budget was how to cut taxes for higher earners while forgetting those most vulnerable and those on the lowest incomes.<\/p>  <p>  We face huge pressures in the areas of housing and health, in particular, with 8,000 people in emergency accommodation, more than 3,000 of whom are children, while there are 680,000 on hospital waiting lists.  It is incredible to think that we had to fight to convince the Government parties of the need to maintain a 2:1 ratio of investment in public services to tax cuts.  I was deeply concerned by the overwhelming focus of the Government and, in particular, the Taoiseach to increase tax bands at all costs.  It was the key tenet of the budget and appeared to be the most important thing for an Taoiseach, more so than investing in our public services.  No one opposes alleviating the tax burden on citizens but when the ESRI warns against such cuts in the context of a housing and health crisis, we have to ask whether the right choice was made.  On the contrary, Fianna F&aacute;il advocated for, and was successful in achieving, a reduction in the USC.  This tax reduction will reach far more people, in particular those on the lowest income.  This is clearly a much fairer way to apply a tax reduction.<\/p>  <p>  The key revenue raising measure in this budget is the increase in commercial stamp duty from 2% to 6%.  I have a concern about this measure and I acknowledge that I am not the first to raise it.  This tax is being used to fund permanent spending on public services but it cannot be said to be a reliable long-term source of tax revenue.  One of the criticisms of budgetary policy during the boom was the over-reliance on unstable tax revenues from the construction sector to fund long-term spending on public services.  I am concerned that using commercial stamp duty to fund an increase in spending on public services is similar to the budget policy once criticised by Fine Gael.  We cannot rely on commercial stamp duty providing a sustainable return to the Exchequer and it is also difficult to predict the annual yield because such a tax is based upon a transaction rate that we cannot be sure of.<\/p>  <p>  There are glaring omissions and failures on the part of the Government to address key expenditure issues in the budget.  The Minister for Finance has described as \"bonkers\" the ongoing pension issue for many women who find themselves in a position where their pension entitlements are severely reduced because they took time out of work to care for their family.  Some women are losing as much as &euro;35 per week.  It is worth noting that some of them, due to the old marriage ban, were forced to give up their job but now they find themselves being punished while the value of their work in the home has been diminished.  Those women deserve an answer from Government as to why this issue was not addressed in the budget.  This brings me to the issue of affordable child care, which affects many women and families across the country.  I welcome the improvements in this regard but the Government is moving at a snail's pace in addressing this issue.  For many families, child care can often be a greater expense than their mortgage, which is difficult to believe, and it is often cited as the greatest barrier to women remaining in the workplace or returning to the workplace.  Financially, families are often better off if one parent stays at home rather than footing a colossal child care bill.  As I said earlier regarding choices, the Government parties, despite all their talk about helping working families, chose to focus on increasing the tax bands and, by their own admission, the average family with two working parents might secure an increase of &euro;600 per year in their pockets.  This amounts to approximately &euro;4 each per week per person.  Given some families fork out &euro;2,000 per month on child care, could better choices have been made to distribute resources?<\/p>  <p>  In the area of housing, there is no doubt that the legacy of this and the previous Government will be their abysmal failure in providing homes for our people.  Under their watch, they have allowed record numbers of individuals, families and children to become homeless, the social impact of which will be felt for many years.  They hid behind the excuse that there was no money and, therefore, houses could not be built, whereas at other times in the State&rsquo;s history when resources were limited, houses were built.  In the 1930s and the 1960s, we made choices to prioritise housing above other areas and homes were built.  People of my generation have given up on ever owning their own home.  I do not say that to be dramatic or to over-egg this but it is the reality.  I say this in the context of spiralling rents, lack of rent controls and an assertion that an affordable starter home should cost between &euro;400,000 and &euro;500,000.  That is not an affordable home and the sooner people stop suggesting it is, the better.<\/p>  <p>  Where do I start on health?  I refer to my constituency of Mayo.  Currently, more than 500 children are waiting for speech and language therapy, and 393 are waiting for physiotherapy appointments.  This is due to a lack of staff.  Even if the vacancies were filled, demand would still not be met.  Once again, the children of the State are being let down when it comes to accessing basic health services.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to my portfolio of defence.  I am deeply disappointed at the lack of investment in this area.  A 2% increase in the day-to-day defence budget is pretty derisory, especially when the 4% increases in Army pensions is taken into consideration.  The budget means that our defence spending will yet again fall relative to national income.  GDP growth is likely to be at least 4% next year, which is welcome.  In 2012, defence expenditure amounted to 0.55% of GDP compared with 1.17% in Sweden and 1.47% in Finland, both neutral countries.  That total, of course, includes Army pensions.  When they are excluded, defence spending amounts to just 0.25% of GDP, which is exceptionally low.  Ireland lacks the minimum conventional capability to provide a credible defence and with the mass exodus of soldiers from the Defence Forces, the budget says to them that the Government does not value them, it will not invest in them and it is not taking the crisis in defence seriously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200020#S00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1507809000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The budget is basically built on shaky foundations.  It is like a three-legged stool with one of the legs badly cracked.  The budget is built on generating an additional &euro;360 million from stamp duty, yet we can see already the problems this is causing in certain parts of the country and for certain people, especially in the farming community.  I will deal with that in more detail later.<\/p>  <p>  I will first deal with the positive developments such as the provision of additional teachers, garda&iacute;, SNAs, and front-line staff in hospitals, which is welcome.  I hope when we examine the figures this time next year, they will reflect these increases and these additional staff will not just be replacing retirees.  We will count these figures at the end of next year to see if these staff have been delivered.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the increase in the old age pension.  It may not be a lot but it is at least going in the right direction.  I also welcome the increases in the FIS and the telephone allowance.  Many people wear a pendant and if they get into difficulty or have a fall, they can press a button and emergency personnel will come to their aid.  That increase is ferociously important because some people were walking away because of the costs associated with the pendants.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the decision to leave the corporation tax rate as it is.  I checked in on what was happening in Strasbourg over the past few days to see what Mr. Juncker was saying.  President Macron and a few other leaders are pushing for changes to the corporation tax regime and I hope Ireland will stand up and be counted in this regard.<\/p><p> It is welcome that a fund is being put together for builders.  At present, there are vultures who are charging builders up to 15% interest and a share of the profits.  However, we should keep the funding of this in-house.  I have been contacted by several credit unions.  Credit unions currently have &euro;15 billion to &euro;16 billion in accounts around the country and they are anxious to get on board with this.  I am aware that the credit unions were consulted when the programme for Government was being negotiated but, oddly enough, there has been no movement since.  If anything, the Government has gone backwards in helping credit unions.  Whether we like it or not, the banks have walked away from most rural areas.  People cannot even get change in some of them and they wonder if they are going into a confessional box in others because one can see nobody unless one goes into a room.  We have to reach a position where the credit unions are given the freedom to be the banks of 25 years ago, where one could say \"hello\" to somebody and where one could be facilitated in whatever one was seeking.  That freedom must be provided, especially in view of the amount of money they have.  The first step in that regard relates to the &euro;750 million from a fund in Europe.  That money, and even &euro;1 billion, is freely available in credit unions.  In fact, there is &euro;7 billion or &euro;8 billion available immediately in credit unions.  That should be used because at least the dividend from it is helping somebody in Ireland when the interest is paid.  I ask the Minister to consider that.<\/p> <p> On the housing measures, houses are not going to be built overnight.  As I have said repeatedly, no council is fit to build houses because councils do not have the resources or the staff.  Second, consider the number of vacant houses.  In this country we do not have a bull's notion of how to get a subcontractor in, have everything priced as the work proceeds and have something turned around in a month or two.  There are houses that have been left vacant for years in every county in the country.  They could help the housing situation.  Whether one is a Minister or otherwise, this is not a light that one can just switch on.  We must ensure that there is delivery.  Unfortunately, we are great at policy.  I have read five or six policies over the last few years.  Ultimately, however, people who are good at policy do not know how to deliver.  They are a different breed of person.  Unless we go down the road of delivering, we will get nowhere.<\/p> <p> The pensions issue is very disappointing.  Many women in this country gave up work to rear families but now that they have reached pension age they have been left behind.  A budgetary measure in 2011 has put them in this situation.  These people are now classed as second class citizens.  Their stamps are divided by 50 and they end up with perhaps half a pension.  We should appreciate that these are people who gave up work to bring up another generation.  As bad as child care is at present, that facility was not available at that time.  It should be the Government's priority to ensure that these people are treated as equal citizens, given their sacrifice and what they have done for this country.  That is most important.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is present.  With regard to roads, perhaps the Minister for Finance was only referring to a few areas but it was interesting to hear him mention Osberstown and an extra lane for the M7.  That is undoubtedly necessary because I travelled that road lately beyond Naas and it is chock-a-block.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, will thank me for saying that.  The Minister also referred to a new connection for trains in Dublin.  What is worrying is that I heard of nothing for the west of Ireland.  Many people have lost their lives on the N4 while works are required on the N5.  A ring road around Galway is needed.  The new M6 motorway is a magnificent piece of work.  However, it is built and we must move on from that and ensure that where it finishes there is an interconnection of roads to Knock and Charlestown to let other parts of the country develop as the areas around Dublin have.  I am not saying that Dublin does not need infrastructure.  However, all the Deputies in the west attend meetings with businesses once or twice a year.  These businesses are run by people who are creating jobs, employing people and keeping them in their local areas.  When one hears those people say that up to 20% of their goods are damaged because of the roads, that is worrying.  It is tougher to bring businesses to those areas if there is no infrastructure.<\/p> <p> We also need broadband infrastructure.  I do not know what the current position is but we appear to have been getting ready to roll it out for the past 18 months or two years and we are no further advanced.  All I can see in that regard is that it now appears that one company will have a monopoly, which is not good.<\/p> <p> With regard to renewables, we hear lovely statements about Ireland getting greener.  There is a budget of &euro;17 million of which &euro;10 million will go on electric cars.  They will be suitable in and around cities if one drives 4,000 km or 5,000 km per year, but let us be realistic about the situation in rural areas.  At present, gas is the only alternative and that costs extra money.  The Government must lead from the front with regard to transport.  If one has ten buses at present and one wishes to change them or buy new buses, one will get about eight, but the running costs for them if they are run on natural gas will be much lower.  A front-loading budget must be provided.  One leads by example.  It is no good taking advantage of people living in rural areas by telling them that they must buy this, that or the other to be greener.  They might not be able to afford it and they do not have a public transport service where there is a bus or taxi service available when they leave the house.  We have to start living in the real world.<\/p> <p> As regards the renewable heat incentive, RHI, there is a sum of &euro;7 million to be shared.  In the case of biomass, I believe we are letting Bord na M&oacute;na head off to Georgia to set up a plant there.  It will have the benefit of an Irish RHI being transferred to it.  The product will be shipped back and we will burn it at 40% efficiency.  That makes sense for whoever came up with that brainwave.  The RHI for biomass, biogas and wind is &euro;7 million, so it will not shake up the world despite all our talk about so-called climate change.<\/p> <p> Turning to agriculture, Deputies will recall that I sought &euro;25 million for the ANC scheme.  In fairness, that has been delivered and I welcome that.  The sheep grant was also delivered.  In the case of the loans, the &euro;300 million in the budget could be increased to &euro;500 million if we did a deal with the credit unions to fund it and the Government provided a backing system.  However, there is one issue that must be tackled.  I am currently inundated with representations from people from all parts of the country whose loans have been sold by the banks.  The vulture funds are taking over.  It is widely reported that they have bought most of these loans from the banks at 30% and 40% and now they are trying to skin the cat by looking for 100%.  There appears to be no talking to them.  The people involved cannot get money anywhere else.  At a time of recovery in the country we must ensure that part of this loan fund is given to those people, so we can buy those loans back and set them up once and for all at realistic figures.<\/p><p>Whatever has to be done to put a stop to what vulture funds are doing, it should be done because this is a downright scandal.<\/p> <p> As Deputies will be aware, the increase from 2% to 6% in the rate of stamp duty on commercial sales is the main talking point of the budget.  I spoke to many people involved in agriculture yesterday.  I am not saying the Minister tried to do this - it may be a consequence of trying to tame the vulture funds - but farmers have been caught in the crossfire.  Most farmers are not inclined to transfer land until they are at least 70 years of age or maybe even 80 years old.  Unfortunately, the children of farmers who may be 37, 38 or 40 years of age have been caught in the crossfire of the increase in stamp duty. <\/p> <p> I found out today that when a farmer transfers assets it becomes problematic on the deed of transfer with entitlements.  This will cause serious problems in rural areas.  Moreover, if shares in a co-operative are being transferred and the special criteria, namely, that the recipient must be under 35 years or the transferee must be under 67 years, do not apply, the parties will also be in trouble.  I tabled a reasonable amendment the other night but unfortunately no one had the good sense to accept it.  We must level the playing field on this issue in the finance Bill.  I will table a further amendment on the matter.<\/p> <p> The budget has another worrying and possibly unintended consequence.  Rural Deputies will have seen many businesses closing in their localities during periods of recession.  Deputies from all parties try to encourage people to buy or set up businesses in our local areas.  In fairness to the Government, it has introduced incentives to do this.  However, a further consequence of the increase in the rate of stamp duty is that it will also affect people in rural areas who decide to buy a business.  They may have only set out on the road and may only have a few employees.  If someone buys a business that has closed and starts a new business within six or nine months, the company will generate revenue, create employment and pay VAT.  I propose that a rebate should be provided in such circumstances, provided a business is reopened within six months, similar to the rebates that apply and which I support in respect of housing.  Without such a measure, the increase in stamp duty will stifle property purchases in smaller towns. <\/p> <p> The Minister spoke of the stamp duty increase generating &euro;360 million of revenue.  Sometimes one has to lose or spend a euro to make &euro;2.  From what I can see, however, this measure will stop investment.  That is my concern.  I am aware of a case where a great deal of work was done trying to persuade a person to buy a business which had been closed for eight or nine years.  In fairness to the individual in question, he took a punt on the business but unfortunately the measure the Minister introduced the other night will cost him more than &euro;20,000.  This is one of the consequences of the measure.  I am not attaching blame as it may have been unforeseen but sometimes when one reaches for the stars, one hits something on the way up.  Politicians have a duty to sort out this mess because it will stifle businesses.  Like all politicians, I do not have much regard for vulture funds but this measure will hit small businesses.<\/p> <p> I ask the Government to increase the loan facilities available.  Credit unions offer an opportunity to do so.<\/p> <p> I read that the budget for the Department of Rural and Community Development will increase by approximately 12%.  The Department will receive the smallest budget of any Department, yet it covers the majority of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200020#S00300","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507810200,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200022#U00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1507810200,"counter":217,"content":"<p>That is some decision.

Councils are skint and do not have money for secondary roads.  I ask the Minister to increase funding for this purpose.  Galway and Roscommon county councils do not have money for roads.  People have to use roads to get to work.  We cannot have potholes and overhanging hedgerows everywhere.  Whether one lives in Broadhaven, Dublin, Donegal or Kerry, one is making a contribution.

The Department has secured the largest increase in capital funding of all Departments to 2021 at &euro;7 billion, with more than &euro;200 million for sport and more than &euro;160 million for tourism.  These figures are sobering, but they also portray a vision for and confidence in the Ireland of 2021 and beyond.  I will point to something that shows great confidence, namely, the figure in the budget for us winning the 2023 Rugby World Cup bid.  I hope that the House shares this confidence and affirms the provision, which itself endorses our vision for Ireland over the next seven years.<\/p>  <p>  In the brief time available to me, I will outline a vision for what transport, sport and tourism will look like in those years.  I do not expect it to be acknowledged by the Opposition, but the Luas cross-city will open in the next two months.  This significant achievement is something that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, refused to abandon even at the worst of times.  It will open at great capital cost, but it will be of considerable benefit to the people of Dublin and this country and contribute towards the removal of traffic from our capital city by taking people out of their cars, which forms part of our vision for 2023 and beyond.<\/p>  <p>  On top of that, I recently announced - it was also announced in the budget - BusConnects, which will be a radical change in the way we transport people in the capital city.  It will be introduced in the next four years.  We will spend &euro;750 million on this commitment to the type of infrastructure that we want for Ireland.  It will introduce corridors that will move people around our capital city much faster than before, corridors that will be adjoined by cycling lanes.  We will also see a DART expansion thanks to this enlarged budget.  In 2021, there will be the commencement of metro north.  It is not to be completed - I apologise to the House for this - until 2027, but it will be completed.  The project is still being designed.<\/p>  <p>  Cycling will also form part of the bigger vision.  We have been criticised by many Deputies for not providing enough money for the switch to cycling that we wish to see.  I have allotted &euro;110 million towards cycling and walking over the next four years.  The resultant changes will form part of the pattern that will emerge in the transport system, not just in Dublin.  Some people called it a \"modal shift\".  I do not like that expression because I do not really understand it.  What it means is moving people out of their cars and into public transport, but one can only do that by providing the necessary public transport inside and outside cities.  That is what we will be doing, and that is what we are committed to doing.  It involves spending the significant amounts of capital that we have been granted in this budget.<\/p>  <p>  We have made renewed commitments to the environment in terms of electric vehicles.  These will be essential and will change the face of transport in this country in the coming years.  The pace of change has not been as fast as we would have liked, but the incentives that we introduced in terms of benefit-in-kind and others-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200023#V00800","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1507810800,"counter":229,"content":"<p>The rabble is starting to get restless, Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200023#V00900","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1507810800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I am sorry, but I did not catch that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200023#V01000","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1507810800,"counter":231,"content":"<p>The remaining 12 minutes are being split into three lots of four minutes each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200023#V01100","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1507810800,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I must wrap up.

The people were fed up taking money out of their pockets.  This budget has stopped that for the first time under the stewardship of the Independent Alliance.  We have been in government for two budgets and we have brought a balanced budget.  I can say one thing - it is great for the people of this country.  There is criticism in the House.  We will take that criticism but we have to take baby steps before we take giant steps and before we can run.

For the first time, we will give &euro;10,000 to an employer to take somebody off the dole for 12 months and give them a living wage.  This is something that will be rolled out next year.  It is something the Independent Alliance brokered and of which it is very proud.  <\/p>  <p>  People have talked about housing.  I have a housing Bill to keep people in their homes.

Two weeks ago, with the Minister, Deputy Ross, we opened the M17-M18.  There are other projects in the pipeline.  As well as that, we have projects that are of most benefit in the very rural areas such as the rural social scheme, the town and village renewal scheme and the CL&Aacute;R funding which is going out to the local authorities on almost a monthly basis.  It is being used by the local authorities to do what the people on the ground have been asking us to do over the past ten years, which is to do the small things and do them right.  It is not billions.  It is creating a huge positive effect on these rural areas and towns and giving them the recognition they need.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome what the Minister, Deputy Ross, spoke about today, which is the doubling of the sports capital grants from &euro;30 million to &euro;60 million.  It is an incredible feat and I thank him on behalf of the Independent Alliance and all the sporting organisations around the country because they will reap the benefit.  Sporting organisations are the backbone of our society and they keep society going in a positive way.  <\/p>  <p>  We have not achieved everything in this budget but when we negotiated the programme for Government, the five members of the Independent Alliance set out an agenda for Government in conjunction with Fine Gael and other Independents.  What we are doing at each budget is implementing the programme for Government.  We will not do it all in one year or all in one budget.  We have surprised a lot of people that we have put through our second budget in a very positive way.  As I said yesterday and the day before, I look forward to working with Government colleagues to make sure we bring forward a budget next year that will be positive and will provide a belief we all need in our country and to make sure it becomes the best country in the world to live in and to raise our families in.  I am proud to be part of a Government that is achieving that.  <\/p>  <p>  We have deficiencies in many places.  The farming community is getting a &euro;25 million increase in the ANC.  The sheep grant of &euro;25 million was brought in last year and will continue this year.  They are positive things for farming.  We have the introduction of an additional loan for farmers.  In terms of Brexit, which is the biggest challenge we are facing, the budget introduced a loan scheme for SMEs to support them.  <\/p>  <p>  We all have challenges but we are facing the biggest challenge with Brexit.  The difficulty with Brexit is it is very hard to quantify what the problem is because it is such a huge problem.  We have to work together for team Ireland to make sure everything we can do will be done as a team to ensure that we get the best possible outcome for Ireland.  In that regard, I welcome that we are increasing our diplomatic service across the world to ensure that we are promoting Ireland in new markets and places.  I had the privilege of being in Canada, the USA and China on trade missions as Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  People have a great respect for Ireland, but we need to be able to promote ourselves out there.  What better way to do it than have our diplomatic services out there and to fund them in a way that they can bring back the best benefit to this country.  We have had ten years of austerity.  This is the first budget which is balanced, as Deputy Moran said.  As well as that, it is the first step in giving some sort of recognition to the people of Ireland, who got us out of the recession.  I acknowledge that.

Some of the speeches I have heard here today so far have been extraordinary.  I will start with Fianna F&aacute;il.  I have listened to some of the Fianna F&aacute;il speakers over the course of the past hour.  I listened to the Fianna F&aacute;il representatives who officially responded to the budget.  On the one hand they say the tax cuts do not go far enough and then they say there should be more money for spending in health and education.  They say we need more money to abolish the USC and we also need more money to invest in public services.  They criticise the budget and they support the budget.  That is what we have heard from Fianna F&aacute;il since budget day.  This is from the same party that did not produce an alternative budget or any costings on how it would increase revenue to pay for the things it calls for.<\/p><p>Yet speaker after speaker waltzed into the Chamber, calling for increased investment, but with nothing behind them.  They are frauds of the highest order and should be called out for what they have tried to do in this year's and last year's budgets.  If they are going to call for increased investment, they should at least have the ability to say where they will get the money to pay for it and then produce the costings.  Of course, Fianna F&aacute;il has not done that and wants to have it both ways.<\/p> <p> I listened carefully to what the Independent Alliance Members had to say; they have now all left.  They all clapped one other on the back and congratulated themselves on how well they have done in the past couple of years and in this budget.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, wrestled with his conscience and told us leading up to the budget that he was going to resign.  We all knew he would not resign; it was all smoke and mirrors.  He is still there whistling a different tune this week.  He got no significant increase in disability services.  There will be no increase to provide the additional child psychologists and the occupational therapists that are necessary in Waterford, the part of the country in which I live.  Nothing in the budget will bring about increased services for children with disabilities in Waterford, where children over six have no access to child psychology services.  The Minister of State has not won a single concession there.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Moran, claims the budget was great for the country and he mentioned housing.  In reality the budget will ensure the health service will stand still because no additional funding has been allocated on top of what is necessary simply to provide the same level of services.  What does that mean?  It means more people lying on hospital trolleys for the next 12 months.  It means that people who must wait up to two years simply to see a consultant will continue to be in the same position.  There has been no additional funding.<\/p> <p> Contrary to what the Taoiseach says, we provided for all of that money in terms of demographics, public sector pay and all the money that was necessary to stand still, plus an additional &euro;400 million, which was in the Sl&aacute;intecare report to which all parties signed up.  However, while Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael can sign up to these reports when it suits them, they will not deliver on them.  They will not put the money behind them to make it a reality.  However, we did and we set out in our budget where we would get the money to pay for them.<\/p> <p> There is no additional housing on top of the targets that were set by the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, in Rebuilding Ireland.  There are no affordable homes.  There is no urgency from the Government on housing.  Every month for the next 12 months, figures will show an increase in homelessness and an increase in the number of people in need of housing.  The Government will simply ask what more it can do.  It had an opportunity at budget time to do something about it and failed to do so.  It pandered to Fianna F&aacute;il.  It picked the worst of the policies from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael; it did a little bit here on the USC and a little bit there on tax cuts for those who pay the top rate of tax.  It all amounts to a couple of euro.  In reality it means that we will continue with the crises in health and housing, which is not good enough.  Far from what the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, said, it is not great for the country.<\/p> <p> My portfolio covers foreign affairs, trade and Brexit.  We have not done nearly enough to ensure we protect the State from Brexit.  The money put aside for schemes is a pittance.  The Government is still not doing enough in respect of the ongoing talks between the British Government and the European Union on Brexit.  Mr. Barnier said today that the current round of negotiations will not move beyond the current position because insufficient progress has been made on the issues being discussed, including Ireland.<\/p> <p> The Irish Government has a role to play in this regard.  It must ensure that the entire island of Ireland is protected, that the Good Friday Agreement is protected and that businesses North and South are protected.  It is not just about the ongoing negotiations; it is about the kinds of supports we put in place for exporters, including the people who live in the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, who depend on the agrifood sector.  The same applies in my area; the entire south east is heavily dependent on agrifood.  What supports will be there for them?  There are businesses affected by currency fluctuations.  Businesses exporting to Britain are looking to the Government for supports.  The Minister of State and I recently attended a meeting organised by IBEC and the chambers of commerce.  They made demands of all parties that they claim need to be met.  I did not see any evidence of any of that in the budget, other than existing schemes dressed up as Brexit responses that are not really a response to Brexit at all.<\/p> <p> We still have one of the lowest capital spends in the European Union and we are not playing catch-up.  The Government announced an additional &euro;790 million, which is mostly standing-still money.  We provided for an additional &euro;1.6 billion.  Despite all the criticism we hear from the Government about the fiscal rules and how they need to be changed and all the rest of it, one flexibility available to us is that we can smooth capital investment over a four-year period, which means for every euro we spend, only 25 cent is calculated in terms of the fiscal space.  Even though we can front-load investment, the Government refuses to do so.  That means less money for roads, flood relief, broadband and all the infrastructure that is necessary.  Yet Ministers, Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies and Fine Gael Deputies will stand up calling for increased capital infrastructure in Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny, Carlow and all these areas.  However, when it comes to budget time, they are not prepared to put their money where their mouths are.<\/p> <p> For all of the waffle I have heard from the Ministers and the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies, the vast majority of people see the budget as a damp squib.  What is in it for the State and for society?  The test for the Government was whether it would actually do something about the real pressing issues affecting people.  Housing and health are the two big ones.  They are the issues that need to be dealt with and the Government has done precious little about any of those issues, which is to its shame.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200024#W01600","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507812000,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I echo what Deputy Cullinane said.  I wish to focus specifically on mental health funding.  The budget made little mention of what funding would be available apart from a measly &euro;35 million to be put into mental health services.  Unfortunately the Government did not clarify if this was additional money or whether the &euro;20 million announced in last year's budget would be carried over.  Stories were buzzing all over the place on the evening of the budget.  No one was given any proper detail at the press conference by the Minister and Ministers of State at the Department of Health on how much money would be put into mental health despite it having been raised.  I do not believe any of the journalists even asked a question on it, which was very surprising.  On budget night I wrote to the Minister's office asking for clarification and as of today I have still received no response, which is extremely disappointing given the position I hold.<\/p>  <p>  Instead of telling the D&aacute;il, the Government kept up the charade of the &euro;35 million of new money until yesterday afternoon, when it finally admitted to some - although not to the D&aacute;il or publicly - that &euro;20 million of this claimed new money was actually announced in budget 2017.  Therefore the actual increase in spending for this year is again &euro;15 million, which is a paltry sum.  If it is added up, it is probably &euro;50 million over the past two years.  A figure of &euro;50 million might possibly be acceptable, because our budget submission, which was costed, proposed an additional &euro;51.2 million.<\/p>  <p>  I congratulate Mental Health Reform, which has made clear that a minimum of &euro;35 million is needed each year just to cover the requirements in A Vision for Change, a policy that is now 11 years old.  Other new developments are coming on board.  I commend Dr. Shari McDaid and Ms Kate Mitchell of Mental Health Reform, who have done extremely valuable work.<\/p>  <p>  I am very concerned about the new money promised for next year.  I believe Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have actually been caught out on this.  It is like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.  It is practically useless.  It is the old promises - if they keep telling a lie over and again, people will eventually believe it.<\/p><p> I have to be honest.  We have heard titbits fired out about a republic of opportunity and about balancing the books.  I will be very brutal and very honest.  Is there a republic of opportunity and are we balancing the books for the parents who have just buried someone whom they lost to suicide?  Have we balanced the books for the pensioners who have spent two years on a waiting list for a hip operation?  I cannot see a republic of opportunity in that.  Have we balanced the books and given this great republic of opportunity to the young person who has to emigrate because he or she cannot afford to live in this country?  It is absolutely ridiculous.<\/p> <p> Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Independent Members of Government sat in a room and hammered this out.  I have listened to it all week and it amazes me that Fianna F&aacute;il can criticise what it has supported in this Chamber.  It is like baking a cake.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il discussed the ingredients, they put them into a pot and they cooked it.  Now they have started to taste it, Fianna F&aacute;il do not like it and are giving out to Fine Gael about it.  It is absolutely ridiculous.  As has been said over and over again, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have normalised poverty and homelessness.  They have practically normalised debt.  The Government had the cheek to talk about supporting mental health in this Chamber last year.  All it has done is lied.  There has been cut after cut.  We are black and blue from saying that Government must get a grip and accept the reality of this.  If Members of the Government do not want to be inside the Chamber, they should get out.  This is a place where work is supposed to be done.  It is not being done.  They come in here and talk the talk but when they leave the Chamber they shut their mouths.  They say to themselves that they are grand and that they are safe now and will be back again.  A person in suicidal form does not have a second chance.  We, as elected representatives, might have a second chance to be elected next time around if we are lucky.  People who present at accident and emergency departments on their last chance of survival do not seem to be a priority for this Government.<\/p> <p> People have asked me what leads people to suicidal ideation.  They are led to suicidal ideation by a Government which looks after itself and which looks after the privileged.  It cannot figure out why people's spirits are broken.  People's spirits are broken because the jobs are crap.  They are extremely low paid and there is no chance of getting on the property ladder.  There have been cuts to the health service, people emigrating, families breaking down and extremely long waiting lists in the health service.  The Government calls this a republic of opportunity.  This is a banana republic.  The Government should be ashamed.  When Members of Government speak out of both sides of their mouths to satisfy the public, they are only fooling themselves because the people are not stupid.  I hope God spares me and that I am re-elected.  There are rumours of &euro;18 million, &euro;19 million and &euro;20 million for mental health funding.  I do not believe it.  The Government is not made up of realists when it comes to helping people, but only when looking after itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200025#X00200","speaker":"1279","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507812600,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Deputy Cullinane began by saying that sometimes this Chamber is like \"Live at the Apollo\".  When I hear what some of the Ministers have said in recent days, it is sometimes like a parallel universe.  They think that people think this budget was good and that there is a perception out there that it was good.  It is not.  Someone on &euro;20,000 will probably have an extra euro in their pocket.  Somebody on &euro;30,000 will probably have an extra &euro;1.50.  The biggest disappointment I have with this budget is the lack of measures being introduced to deal with housing, homelessness and the health sector.  The dogs in the street know that there is a massive problem.  All of the services are under pressure.  There are massive problems with families being homeless and families having no chance of getting a home.<\/p>  <p>  The hospital in my own constituency, University Hospital Limerick, UHL, is at breaking point.  A brand new accident and emergency department opened in May of this year and it has done nothing to resolve the situation.  It has in fact got critically worse.  Some 902 people were on trolleys in UHL in September, which was the highest figure in the State by a country mile.  The money allocated to the health budget will mean that services will, at the very best, stay as they are for this year.  The situation will not get any better.  Some 700,000 people are on waiting lists and thousands of people are on trolleys every month across the city.  The number of homeless people has increased to more than 8,000, 3,000 of whom are children.  The Government, however, decided that it would allocate &euro;335 million to tax cuts.  This money could have made a difference in addressing those problems, but Fine Gael chose a different path.  Unfortunately, I do not see these problems being resolved before this time next year as a result of those decisions.<\/p>  <p>  To address business, enterprise and innovation, I was not overwhelmed by the measures introduced, although the additional resources for Brexit and innovation are welcome.  Additional funding of &euro;400,000 for the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, however, will barely make a dent in that agency's requirement.  At the beginning of the month, the CEO of the HSA said that it could need up to an additional 50 staff.  This funding will only meet one sixth of that target.  There was no mention of specific additional funding for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, despite the public outrage earlier this year when the trial of the former chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, Se&aacute;n Fitzpatrick, collapsed due to the botched investigation carried out by the ODCE.  The investigation was botched as a result of the lack of resources in that agency.<\/p>  <p>  One major issue I want to raise is the minimum wage.  I have raised this point in this Chamber on a number of occasions and it is something about which I feel very strongly.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes in introducing a living wage and in this budget we suggested raising the minimum wage to &euro;10 per hour as a move towards achieving this objective.  Unfortunately, the small increase of 3% announced on Tuesday will do little to help workers who are struggling to make ends meet.  Workers are not able to make enough on &euro;9.25 an hour and I do not believe that &euro;9.55 will do enough to help them with the incredible cost of rent, insurance and child care.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, previously described this proposal as \"miserly\", \"derisory\" and \"quite pathetic\".  He went on to say that a livable wage would not be reached with ridiculous increases such as this.  It is quite pathetic.  One would wonder how the Government decided on that figure.  I completely agree with what the Minister of State said and I am disappointed that his colleagues in the Independent Alliance did not back him up and ensure the introduction of an increase of more than 3%.  Fianna F&aacute;il did not even mention the minimum wage in its budget document.  This is no surprise as the last time it touched the minimum wage was to cut it by &euro;1.<\/p>  <p>  Another massive oversight in this budget is the fact that PRSI bands will not change in line with the minimum wage increase, meaning that almost half of the &euro;584 which people on the minimum wage think they will get due to the 30 cent increase will in fact be eaten up by tax.  The Taoiseach came in here yesterday waving around the Sinn F&eacute;in alternative budget.  He did not, however, point out that on page 54 we allocated funding of over &euro;20 million to ensure that workers and employers would not be hit with costs as a result of the rise in the minimum wage, which is something the Government did not do in its budget.  Its budget will mean that people on &euro;18,000 a year will see their effective tax rate increase by 1.4% while people earning &euro;100,000 will see a reduction of 0.3%.  That really says it all.  The International Monetary Fund, IMF, is today calling on governments finally to start taxing the rich to help the poor.  It is about time we started doing that in this country.<\/p>  <p>  One issue of huge concern to me and on which I have campaigned for years is the issue of drugs and drug abuse in the country.  I note the level of funding to drugs initiatives has remained static for 2018 despite huge problems in this area.  I am well aware of the problems which drug addiction is causing in Limerick and the mid-west and I am very disappointed that more resources will not be allocated to tackle this problem in 2018.  The new drugs strategy which An Taoiseach launched in July will mean nothing and will fail if additional funding is not delivered to those on the front line dealing with the scourge of drugs in Limerick and across the State.  I am on the board of the mid-west regional drugs and alcohol forum.  We have experienced cuts of up to 50% since 2008.  None of that has been restored.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, spoke about flooding.  We have a massive issue with flooding in Limerick.  We are waiting on flood defences to be built.  The latest information I have is that it will be 2021 before they are built.  There is not enough money in the budget to ensure that will happen.  In our alternative budget we had allocated enough money to do so.<\/p>  <p>  This budget is very disappointing.  It fails to provide the substantial funding needed for the emergencies which we have - the housing crisis and homelessness.  Fine Gael was clearly thinking of an election and not what is best for the country when it conjured up this budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200026#Y00200","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1507812600,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I am sorry to see Deputy Cullinane leaving before I get to deliver my response to his comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200026#Y00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1507812600,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I am sure it will be great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200026#Y00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1507812600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>The last speaker has it all wrong.  If one reflects on the journey we have travelled, this is the best budget for the country.  I remember sitting in here when unemployment was at 15%, borrowing was at 15% and interest rates were at 15%.  Some 300,000 people had lost their jobs.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in's solution was that we should walk out on our debts.  That would have made all those problems worse.  There is not a single speaker on the Sinn F&eacute;in benches who will recognise that over the last few years, while they have opposed everything this Government has sought to do, we have brought unemployment down from 15% to 6%.  We have brought the cost of borrowing down from 14% to 0.5% and less, and we have reduced State borrowing from where we could only raise moneys from the troika down to having a balanced budget, with a deficit of less than 0.5%.  That is real progress and 228,000 people are now back at work under the policies of this and the previous Government.  They are, by and large, working in very good quality employment; in IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland companies.  While there of course are also people who are employed in lower-paid sectors, we have had four increases in the minimum wage since 2011, which is a very significant improvement.  We have rowed back across all of those very difficult tax burdens that bound those people.  The universal social charge, USC, has been consistently rowed back in the past three budgets.  We have reduced the burden on hard-working families.  That has made a difference to people who were put to the pin of their collar to survive in a very difficult period.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in cannot acknowledge any of that progress.  What is more, their prescription for the economy for the future is just unsustainable.  It has proposed a budget that would see, at the upper end of income, a 75% tax burden on higher incomes.  There is not any economy outside North Korea that would consider it possible to grow employment opportunities by having taxes of 75% imposed on people at work.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200026#Y00500","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507813200,"counter":263,"content":"<p>That is fantasy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200027#Z00200","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speech","time":1507813200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>That includes a 60% proposal for income tax and a further 15% to be paid by employers.  The difficulty is Sinn F&eacute;in does not understand what it takes to create a fair society.  One cannot create a fair society without also having a strong and sustainable economy.  None of the policies put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in would support that.  Over its track record, indeed, it has opposed everything that sought to do that.  What the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, instead set out to do was, as he said himself, to safeguard our economy.  He has restored balance to our books at a time when even Sinn F&eacute;in is recognising that we are facing threats.  He has made sure that the growth in current spending is in line with the capacity of the economy so we are not repeating the mistakes that occurred in the early 2000s after we joined the eurozone when, year after year, the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Governments increased spending by 12% per annum consistently for a decade.  That simply was not sustainable.  People who express surprise that it came tumbling down must examine that.  We were trying to expand our economy beyond its sustainable capacity and what is more, we were relying on a property sector that was unsustainable.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to address the issue of fairness.  We are all constituency representatives.  We all meet people who come into our clinics and who would like to see improvements in health and mental health services.  What we are doing is consistently making changes that are sustainable to bring about those changes.  In my own area, which is particularly concerned with children, for a second time in three years we have reduced the class size at primary level.  In the 18 months I have been in this post, we already have 7,000 extra staff in our schools, 5,000 of whom are teachers and 2,000 of whom are special needs assistants, SNAs.  In the year to come, we will put in place another 1,300 teachers and 1,000 SNAs.  Nobody on the Sinn F&eacute;in benches will recognise that this makes a difference to the very sort of people they are talking about - those who are under pressure.  We put in guidance counselling.  We expanded the National Educational Psychological Service to help people who are in stress situations.  We rolled out for the first time a comprehensive well-being programme at junior cycle level and all schools are now developing a well-being strategy.  That is laying down the foundations to deal with the sort of challenges that young people encounter.  We have to have strategies to deal with this and I accept that we do.  That is exactly what we are doing.  We will have 9,500 extra people in our schools in the space of two years to help children to cope in a very challenging environment.<\/p>  <p>  For the first time in as long as I can remember, we have increased the payment to people who are on low incomes, for their children.  I cannot remember when that was last done in this House and I have been here a long time.  Families on low incomes are entitled to support for their children.  We are rolling out a child care support programme, which we never had in this State.  Now every child will be able to access some support for child care up to the age of three.  It is focused particularly on the lower-paid, who can access support of up to &euro;7,000 per year.  That is really significant investment in children for people who are low paid.  It is really important that we recognise the progress we are making.  We are giving two full years at preschool.  That has been expanded repeatedly from what was one year to two years.  We are building out the base of a long-term sustainable child care programme that will lead into better impact at primary school and passing on through secondary school.  We talk about a republic of opportunity because we are building from the base, helping the families in the least well-off position to support their children.  This year, we will again invest in DEIS, the programme for disadvantaged children.  We continue to expand support for children with special educational need.<\/p>  <p>  I will not take lectures about how one can change the fairness of our community.  We are steadily making things fairer.  Low-income pensioners lost the telephone allowance.  We have all knocked on doors and seen how people really felt undermined by that.  Now we are seeing the telephone allowance come back, as there is an additional allowance of &euro;2.50, as well as the &euro;5 general increase and the &euro;22.50 for the extra week of the fuel scheme.  That is a genuine attempt to support low-income pensioners who have suffered in these difficult years.  We are repairing the damage that was sustained over a decade but it is not going to be done overnight.  It will not be done by introducing a 75% tax burden on the very enterprises we hope will strengthen us against Brexit and other challenges.<\/p>  <p>  We have to future-proof this economy.  That is something the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has done very strongly.  In my own area, we will have a 73% increase in our capital budget by 2021.  That will allow us to invest in traineeships, apprenticeships, school places and all the things that build for the future in an education sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200027#Z00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1507813200,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the key budget measures I am introducing in 2018.  I am pleased to announce a further package of over &euro;300 million in 2018 to develop our cultural and creative heritage.  I have also secured an additional &euro;90 million in capital funding between 2018 and 2021.  This increases my Department's capital funding by almost 50% over that period, which will allow for multi-annual planning for the first time.  This points to the Government's clear commitment to incrementally increasing arts and culture funding over the coming years.  It also acknowledges the enormous contribution that arts, culture and creativity make to our nation's fabric, identity and well-being.  In 2018, my Department's budget will increase by &euro;13 million, comprising &euro;9 million in current expenditure and &euro;4 million in capital expenditure.  This includes an &euro;8.5 million boost in funding for arts and culture to accelerate the Creative Ireland programme, which is designed to mainstream creativity in the life of the nation.  Creative Ireland is a five-year all-of-Government programme aligned with Culture 2025 - &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach, and framed within A Programme for a Partnership Government.  The year 2017 has one of extraordinary discovery as the programme engaged with communities the length and breadth of the country.  I am delighted to be in a position to build on the positive engagement of the last year through allocating resources to arts, culture and creativity in budget 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, our heritage, language, islands and waterways are also vividly reflected in our cultural output.  They mark our sense of identity as strongly as our literature, music, dance, theatre and art.  In addition to their cultural merits, however, these areas make a significant contribution to supporting economic activity and employment across the country.<\/p><p>This is the case both directly and indirectly though cultural and heritage tourism.  The funding package I have secured for 2018 allows for increases across all programme areas.  In broad terms, the 2018 allocation to my Department includes over &euro;167 million for culture to accelerate the Creative Ireland programme; over &euro;47 million for the conservation and protection of Ireland's built and natural heritage; over &euro;48.5 million for the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and islands; and almost &euro;40 million for North-South co-operation projects, including support for Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga.<\/p> <p> It is an exciting moment for arts, culture and creativity from the opening of landmark exhibitions in our national cultural institutions to innovative community arts projects around the country.  The Creative Ireland programme is already yielding positive results in both rural and urban communities with more and more people engaging with creativity than ever before.  I am determined to build on this momentum in the coming year by prioritising funding increases to key institutions, agencies and initiatives which deliver arts and culture.  The &euro;170 million culture budget for 2018 is targeted at increasing citizen engagement and creativity through the five pillars of the Creative Ireland programme.  The Arts Council will receive an additional &euro;3 million to enhance its support to artists and art organisations of all sizes.  This represents a 5% increase to its annual budget, bringing it to &euro;68 million, a 20% boost in funding since 2014.<\/p> <p> I listened with some interest to the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson earlier.  I remind Fianna F&aacute;il that when it was in government, it decreased the Arts Council budget by &euro;18 million between 2008 and 2011.  In 2011, it left an unmerciful economic mess behind it for which the people paid dearly and others had to clean up.  That should be contrasted with what I have done since I was appointed Minister in 2014.  I have increased the Arts Council budget by 20%, over &euro;11 million.  Action speaks louder than words.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200027#Z00400","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507813800,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200028#AA00200","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speech","time":1507813800,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I am allocating a further &euro;1.5 million to the Irish Film Board to build on its vital work in supporting Irish film, television drama, documentary and animation.

Although autonomous bodies, the work of the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board builds on the pillars of the Creative Ireland programme.  I look forward to continued success in collaborating with them in the year ahead.<\/p>  <p>  I was surprised to hear negative comments about Creative Ireland from Deputy Niamh Smyth.  I felt she played the person, not the ball.  I found her personal comments regarding members of the Creative Ireland team both unnecessary and unbecoming of a Member of the House.  Nobody knows better than she does the great work the Creative Ireland team has done with local authorities.  She was more than happy to attend the launch of the Creative Ireland plans in Cavan recently, which makes her contribution today all the more surprising.<\/p>  <p>  Access to arts is the driving force of Creative Ireland, which is why I have allocated &euro;1 million to commence the initiative.  I am pleased this figure will be matched by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, bringing the budget to &euro;2 million for 2018.  The initiative will be delivered in partnership with the Arts Council.  For the same reason, I will double the arts funding to local authorities in 2018.  This will harness the energy of pillar two of Creative Ireland, enabling creativity in every community which saw 750 events taking place across Ireland in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Culture Ireland will receive an extra &euro;500,000 in 2018, a boost of 14%, which increases its budget to &euro;4 million.  The extra funds will allow my Department to deliver an enhanced cultural programme across Great Britain in 2018.  This will build on both the unique relationship between our two countries and pillar five of Creative Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Our national cultural institutions will all receive increases in funding in line with pillar three of Creative Ireland.  They will also be a priority in the &euro;90 million capital investment I have secured between 2018 and 2021.  A further round of the successful arts and cultural capital scheme is also planned for 2018 as part of this additional capital funding.  This will improve and enhance our arts facilities across the country, in particular in rural communities.  I will make further announcements regarding the &euro;90 million capital funding for 2018 to 2021, as well as the longer term ten-year capital plan in the coming period.<\/p>  <p>  I have allocated &euro;47.1 million to my Department's heritage programme in 2018, including &euro;36.7 million in current funding and &euro;10.4 million in capital funding.  Capital expenditure in 2018 will continue to focus on peatlands protection and restoration, along with the conservation and development of our built and natural heritage.  I am increasing funding for the structures-at-risk scheme and the successful built heritage investment scheme, which will operate again in 2018.  The focus on natural heritage will be threefold, namely the development and operation of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, on our nature reserves and continuing to meet our obligations under EU directives.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to developing North-South co-operation within the broader arts, heritage and commemorative activities of my Department, as well as through the funding for North-South bodies.  Almost &euro;40 million will support the two North-South implementation bodies, An Foras Teanga, comprising Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency, and Waterways Ireland.  These budgets will be subject to approval of the North-South Ministerial Council in due course.<\/p>  <p>  Up to &euro;48.6 million will be allocated to the Irish language, Gaeltacht and the islands in 2018, comprising &euro;38.1 million in current funding and &euro;10.5 million in capital funding.<\/p>  <p>  Each of the programme areas under my Department's remit will play a key role in the conservation, preservation and development of our unique cultural and creative heritage.

This, together with additional funding provided for later years, will ensure we are well placed to continue to build on the progress already made in meeting the diverse range of the housing needs of our citizens and deliver on the ambitious targets under the Rebuilding Ireland programme.  If we stick to this plan and continue with this investment of money, we will solve the current housing difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  The extra &euro;600 million provided, a 46% increase in funding for next year, will allow us to meet the housing needs of some 25,500 households and to focus increasingly on direct construction.  The additional &euro;500 million in capital secured as part of the review of the capital plan will allow the overall Rebuilding Ireland social housing budget target to be increased from 47,000 houses to 50,000, the figure recommended by the all-party Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness last year.<\/p>  <p>  The total funding envelope has increased from &euro;5.35 billion to &euro;6 billion.  Such a significant commitment of taxpayers' money, the highest ever in the State's history, proves untrue the argument that the Government is not for building social houses.  There is a range of measures to tackle house vacancy and affordability which will be announced over the weeks ahead.  The Traveller accommodation budget has increased again this year by over 50% with over &euro;12 million to be spent in 2018.  The housing adaptation grant scheme will have increased funding of &euro;5 million bringing it to &euro;53 million.

There will be a total investment of &euro;1.83 billion for housing in 2018 with 3,800 new social houses to be built next year by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  The social housing current expenditure programme will deliver an extra 4,000 extra social housing units next year.  The housing needs of 25,500 households will be met in 2018.  Every day next year, 98 households will have their housing needs met.  The housing assistance payment has been increased by &euro;149 million and it will enable 17,000 extra households to be supported and accommodated in 2018.  Funding for homeless services will be increased to over &euro;116 million.<\/p>  <p>  On coming into office, the Government has increased investment in the Garda.  The budget will provide resources to allow for the recruitment of an additional 800 Garda students, along with another 500 civilian Garda personnel.  I welcome this investment as my constituency, Louth, knows only too well the importance of having garda&iacute; on the beat.<\/p><p> We need to help families.  The budget reduced the universal social charge from 2.5% to 2% and from 5% to 4.75%, increased the earnings disregard for the one parent family payment and the jobseeker's transitional scheme by &euro;20 per week and decreased the threshold for receipt of family income supplement by &euro;10 per week.  Some 1,300 additional teaching posts are to be provided in 2018, while the pupil-teacher ratio at primary school level will be reduced and there will be more breakfast clubs for DEIS schools.  It also provided a &euro;5 per week increase in social welfare payments, which include disability allowance, carer's allowance and jobseeker's allowance and benefit.  A Christmas bonus of 85% will again be paid to all social welfare recipients in 2017.  A Brexit loan scheme was launched that will make up to &euro;300 million available at a competitive rate to help businesses with their short-term working capital needs.  The retention of the special 9% VAT rate for the tourism sector is particularly important in the context of Brexit and will help Border towns such as my home town of Dundalk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200028#AA00800","speaker":"1331","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507814400,"counter":275,"content":"<p>If my learned colleagues in Fine Gael cannot figure out how to share 20 minutes, is it any wonder not enough houses have been built in the past few years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200029#BB00200","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1507814400,"counter":276,"content":"<p>We shared the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200029#BB00300","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1507814400,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I would like to have heard more from the Minister of State, Deputy English.

However, Fianna F&aacute;il has had some influence on the budget through the confidence and supply agreement.  During talks with the Government over the past number of weeks, Fianna F&aacute;il prioritised investment in public services and further protection for vulnerable individuals, families and communities.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of education, I am especially pleased that the budget has provided for smaller class sizes, more career guidance counsellors and an increase in third level funding to include more critical supports for postgraduate students.  As regards health, the budget includes Fianna F&aacute;il's priority of significant new investment in the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, which will reduce the unacceptably long waiting lists for surgical procedures.  It includes more funding for disability services to reduce the unacceptably long waiting times for assessments.  For families and communities, because of Fianna F&aacute;il's priorities being insisted upon, the budget includes provision for more garda&iacute;, more affordable child care, the retention of mortgage interest relief for the negative equity generation, which is very important, and a modest increase for pensioners and those in receipt of social protection benefits, which is only the second such increase in the past ten years.  The budget would not look like that had Fianna F&aacute;il not influenced it.  We know from statements made by Fine Gael members in recent months that the budget would have prioritised tax cuts and wealth creators, which is an awful phrase straight out of the Margaret Thatcher handbook of Tory politics.<\/p>  <p>  The budget is far from perfect.  Its most disappointing aspect is the lack of urgency and investment in solving the homelessness crisis.  I listened carefully to the Minister of State, Deputy English, during the two minutes and 45 seconds he had to speak and I acknowledge significant additional capital has been made available for investment in social housing and that neither this Government nor any other could build enough houses to deal with the homelessness situation overnight.  However, all Members are aware of the awful reality that there are 3,000 homeless children in the State.  All Members have met homeless families and listened to the testimony of what it means for those mothers and fathers, both for themselves and in terms of what it means to raise school-going children in single rooms.  It is heartbreaking and is unacceptable to the country and to Fine Gael.

Surely to God in a modern Irish republic with the efforts of all Members we could match 3,000 homeless children to 180,000 or 100,000 vacant homes.  Surely to God we are capable of doing that and that is what we should be doing.  That is what is missing most in the budget.<\/p>  <p>  As regards Brexit, I acknowledge genuine and useful measures such as the agrifood sector loan scheme, funding for our embassies to grow, funding to build digital infrastructure, which is very important, a &euro;300 million SME loan scheme that is to be welcomed, and a modest amount of additional funding for State agencies, Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia in particular.  Although those measures are welcome, are they enough?  Are they a commensurate response to what the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, described as the biggest economic threat to face the country since the foundation of the State?  In that context, it is difficult to conclude that the budget is commensurate with the risk posed by Brexit.  <\/p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners report recently leaked to RT&Eacute; provides a stark analysis of the scale of what Irish businesses will face should the UK follow through on its stated intention to leave both the customs union and the Single Market.  The report states that 91,000 businesses in Ireland trade with the UK and will, therefore, be directly affected by Brexit, as will the farming community and the tourist industry.  The report says that the cost to those businesses in terms of administration and financial burden due to Brexit cannot be underestimated.  It predicts compliance volumes increasing by 800% and WTO tariffs kicking in if there is a disorderly Brexit.  That would mean 50% tariffs on Irish beef, half of which is sold to the UK.  That would be an existential crisis for our beef sector.  The same applies to a greater or lesser degree in other sectors such as agrifood, textiles, electronic equipment and so on.  We need to be aware that should the UK take back its territorial fishing waters, as a member of the British Government signalled to me it is considering, that would pose an existential threat to Ireland's fishing industry.<\/p>  <p>  The threat posed by Brexit is such that we cannot just mitigate the risks.  We need to work with those 91,000 companies to ensure they are doing everything they can to expand into new markets because that is how people have to start thinking.  Does the budget respond sufficiently to the threats posed by Brexit and the opportunities it presents?  Unfortunately, it did not, although some measures it provides for are welcome.  Unfortunately, that fits with the Government response to date to Brexit.  The Government, along with Irish officials and diplomats, deserves great credit for some of the diplomatic wins between Dublin and the European Union in Brussels.  The common travel area has strong support, which may not have been the case were it not for the work of the Government.<\/p><p>The issues for Ireland and Northern Ireland are front and centre in the negotiations, and this may not have been the case and is to be recognised.<\/p> <p> However, when it comes to the domestic response to Brexit, this Government has not done enough and continues not to do enough.  The Government still says Brexit has not happened yet, but Irish businesses all over the country are struggling with weaker sterling and lower sales orders from the UK.  The Government says detailed analysis on the impact of a hard Brexit is not available while suppressing that very analysis.  It cites Enterprise Ireland's support for 600 companies as evidence that Brexit is being taken seriously, but 91,000 companies trade with the UK.  What of the other 90,400?  The Government still has not produced detailed sector-by-sector analyses, which has been promised again and again and, as we now know, it has instructed Revenue, customs and other parts of the Civil Service to stand down and stop preparing for Brexit.  We must do everything in our power to avoid a hard Brexit, but the current political trajectory is that the UK will leave the customs union and the Single Market.  It is reckless not to act on this and to have stood down the Civil Service.  The &euro;300 million fund is welcome but, again, in the scale of Brexit this would represent just &euro;3,300 for each of those 91,000 companies.  A sum of &euro;300 million sounds like a lot; throw it against Brexit and it turns out it is not so much.  We must be more ambitious.  We need a national programme of support for these 91,000 companies.  This means extensive training in areas such as currency hedging, pricing strategy, supply chain analysis, marketing and product development.  It means adaptation funding for working capital and access to affordable loans and investment capital.  It means support for market analysis and product development and, critically, it means an inter-agency approach to helping these companies access new markets.  If we do this, it will go a long way towards mitigating the risks posed by Brexit and might just start to turn an enormous economic threat into a very significant opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200029#BB01600","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507815000,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I have been here for the past two hours and have listened to many contributions from all sides of the House.

In addition, I welcome the new telephone support allowance of &euro;2.50 per week for 124,000 people who are living alone.  The loss of the telephone allowance in recent years cannot be overestimated.  Older people chose to have their phone lines removed.  The standing charge and VAT were a step too far, with the phone calls the cheapest part of the bill in most instances.  Older people simply could not afford the phone bill in most cases.  This also had a huge effect on vulnerable older people who needed the landline for a panic button.  This security measure is extremely important for older people living alone who are vulnerable and dependent.  This is certainly a step in the right direction.  However, the criteria are strict, with only people claiming the living alone allowance and the fuel allowance set to qualify in budget 2018.  Again, I was disappointed that this year the living alone allowance was not increased and stays at a paltry &euro;9.  When one member of a couple in receipt of the State pension dies, the loss of the spouse's pension is extremely difficult for the surviving spouse to cope with as the household bills remain the same.  To lose a weekly income of approximately &euro;230 at a time of grief is difficult, and I specifically ask the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to look at this payment to see whether it is possible to increase the living alone allowance or to allow a reduced spouse's pension, even on a tapered basis, to ease the financial burden.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the health service, there will be additional funding for home care packages and a greater use of transitional beds to allow older people to get out of acute hospitals more quickly.  This is essential.  Given the modest budget, the key test is delivery for the 549 people on trolleys yesterday, of whom 41 were in University Hospital Waterford.  I shudder to think what the numbers will be like as the winter approaches, with the flu season kicking in and the surge in demand for hospital care.  I welcome the allocation of &euro;55 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  This fund worked before and will work again if the will is there.  Buying spare capacity in hospitals that have capacity makes sense.  Targeting medical procedures such as hip and knee replacements and cataracts is an important part of ensuring money is well spent.  Normally it is older people who are most affected by these ailments, affecting quality of life and mobility, and I believe a targeted approach would yield great results.  It would seriously improve quality of life and would mean less people presenting at accident and emergency departments.<\/p>  <p>  This was not a perfect budget, and in areas outside of the remit of the confidence and supply agreement, Fine Gael has not ensured that older people would not lose out.  There was no mention of post offices at all in yesterday's budget announcement.  The closure of post offices will disproportionately affect older people more than any other sector of Irish society.  The lack of recognition of the importance of post offices is a worry for my party and, more importantly, for older people who rely so much on the local post office.  An Post has confirmed that between 160 and 360 post offices will close across the country in the next four years.  A national review is ongoing, with ten post offices closed on a temporary basis pending the results of the review.  I accept that postmasters and postmistresses may choose to retire and it will not always be possible to retain the service in every town and village.  However, every effort will have to be made to halt the decline and encourage users and customers to vote with their feet and choose their local post office.  There is a whole generation that is not online or tech-savvy and who depend on the post office network.  I will continue to campaign to retain post offices in order to ensure that older people can remain connected to their communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200030#CC00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1507815000,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Every morning when I wake up in south Kildare, I think about the people whom I am proud to represent and about the decisions we make in this House that impact them and the quality of their lives.  Ultimately, that is what our job is all about, and it is the same on budget day.  On budget day and in the days since, I have been thinking about the children in overcrowded classrooms in Kildare.  I welcome the commitment to lower the pupil-teacher ratio, which was a key issue for Fianna F&aacute;il in negotiating our confidence and supply agreement, but it is too late for some schools.  I wish to highlight Ballyshannon national school as an example.  It is a four-teacher school, has 37 children in junior infants and is having a constant issue with the Minister for Education and Skills.  I hope this will be taken on board.  I think of the children with special needs.  Again, I welcome the fact that we will have more special needs assistants but I highlight, for example, that there are eight children with special needs in one unit in Scoil na Naomh Uilig in Newbridge who have no secondary classroom to go to in June.  This budget does not help or support these children.  I think of the 400 children and their parents in south Kildare who in two years' time will have no secondary school place to go to.  I do not see anything in the budget that addresses these needs.  I think of Anne and women like her in my constituency who, because they worked many years ago, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, are deprived of their appropriate pension because of legislation brought in in 2012.  I do not see anything in the budget to allay their fears and concerns.  I think of all of the people in business.  I met with 80 women in business this morning in Kildare through the local enterprise office.  I think of all that could have been done to support the small and medium-sized enterprises and other enterprises.  We absolutely need to give business that extra shot in the arm.  I think of the hundreds of people who lined the streets in Newbridge on Tuesday night, which was budget night but also World Mental Health Day.  Those people came out in a communal expression of grief in the wake of the five people who took their lives within five days in my community over the past week.  I do not see anything in the budget that will help or support them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200030#CC00300","speaker":"1257"}]
