The decision to establish the independent review mechanism was an unprecedented process initiated by the Government to bring an independent examination to bear on allegations of wrongdoing.  The initiative went far beyond anything that any previous Government did to address the types of issue raised by these allegations.<\/p>  <p>  As I have repeatedly emphasised, the independent review mechanism was not established to act as a commission of inquiry or investigation, nor was it designed to make findings.  Its purpose was to triage allegations to determine whether further action was needed and, if so, what that further action should be.<\/p>  <p>  As will become obvious, the range of matters covered by the cases referred to the panel was very wide.  It included property disputes, including some that were referred by Deputy Niall Collins, probate issues, disputes between neighbours and dissatisfaction with the outcome of civil and criminal court actions, as well as decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  These are all matters in which I, as Minister, do not have a role.  Nevertheless, they were considered by the panel despite the fact that, at face value, they were outside the remit of the independent review mechanism.<\/p><p>I am happy to confirm to the Deputy that the panel has provided recommendations to me in all 320 cases submitted to it and has therefore largely concluded its work.  The issuing of notification letters to complainants commenced on 29 June.  To date, 216 complainants have been notified of the outcome of the review of their cases.  Letters will continue to issue to all complainants until the process is completed.  I am clear and mindful that all complainants are anxious to know the outcome of the review of their case and every effort is being made to conclude the process.  Given the figures, I am confident that it will be concluded shortly.  In each case, a summary is prepared together with a draft letter to the complainant.  Mr Justice Roderick Murphy is continuing to review the summaries and the draft letters of notification to ensure that they are a fair and accurate reflection of the recommendations made by counsel.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>I have previously assured Deputies that where further investigation is recommended by the review then that will occur.  Where cases have resulted in recommendations for further action, including, for example, referral to the Garda\u00a0S&iacute;och&aacute;na\u00a0Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, or requesting\u00a0a report from the Garda Commissioner in accordance with section 41(2) of the Garda\u00a0S&iacute;och&aacute;na\u00a0Act 2005, I have accepted those recommendations.  The issues involved in the cases also range considerably, from tragic deaths to property disputes.  With respect to the cases for which the panel has recommended no further action\u00a0by the Minister, it should be noted that the reasons for this recommendation vary greatly but include the fact that the complaint disclosed no allegation of any wrongdoing by the\u00a0Garda; the case related to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution which is independent of the Minister in relation to decisions as to whether or not a prosecution is warranted; or the case related to the courts which are also independent and it would be improper for the Minister to interfere in any way with their decisions.  Furthermore, it should be noted that there are many cases which have already been through some form of process whether it was in the courts, GSOC or some other\u00a0body.<br\/><br\/>To conclude, I note that there has been considerable media coverage recently concerning the review process.  Some of the reporting has been quite inaccurate.  Nevertheless, I recognise the genuine concerns raised by those whose complaints were forwarded to the panel for review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000003#A00600","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445346300,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The Minister will be aware that the \"Prime Time\" programme on RTE carried a report in recent weeks on this matter during which a number of issues were aired.

It is well recognised that organised crime seeks to exploit the Border.  Cross-Border crime and the people involved pose serious issues.  I have held many discussions with the Northern Minister, Mr. Ford, about the challenges presented by cross-Border organised crime as well as our responses to same.  Recently, we discussed these challenges at a seminar in Sligo on cross-Border organised crime, where I was impressed to see the staff of the Garda and the PSNI working closely together to target this problem.  Down the years, many initiatives have resulted from such discussions.<\/p>  <p>  I support the valuable contribution made by the BIPA's report on cross-Border crime.  Well done to all involved.  A key feature of the ongoing work is the inter-agency nature of law enforcement co-operation, in that it involves the two police forces and the two customs services on the island as well as the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and the UK's National Crime Agency.<\/p>  <p>  Two cross-Border enforcement groups that target fuel fraud and tobacco fraud, respectively, have been in operation for some years and have made a considerable contribution to operational co-operation in the area.  Recently, at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, I put into the public arena some of the up-to-date figures on, for example, fuel smuggling and recent successes.  Given the fact that 131 garages have been closed around the country, this is a serious issue that requires attention.

In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  The programme supports the provision of 21st century policing services for urban and rural areas and allows front-line garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility and flexibility and in a more focused fashion, in particular with regard to various targeted police operations.

One important factor that emerged was the finding that a large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders.  Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars.  As I noted earlier, that is why I brought forward the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill, which is targeted at repeat burglars with previous convictions.  That will allow for consecutive sentencing where a burglar is being sentenced for multiple offences and allow courts to refuse bail.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation on its own is not enough and we want proper operational policing responses.  The Deputy asked about figures.  The Garda strategy to counter burglaries and related crimes has been co-ordinated under Operation Fiacla, which has led to 14,672 arrests and 8,358 charges brought to date.  I am providing the Commissioner with the means to enhance this operational response.

Clearly, there are different views on the management and handling of these issues and we will have an opportunity to discuss them.  I do not want to prejudge the debate but I am sure it will be an interesting one.  The debate has already started in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>  <p>  The proposals in the legislation have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012.  The new offences implement the recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.  The purpose of introducing these provisions is primarily to target the trafficking, which is very extensive, and sexual exploitation of persons through prostitution.  There is a very strong association between the trafficking of young women and girls into this country and prostitution and this legislation is targeting that situation.  <\/p>  <p>  I have considered all sides of the debate and my Department has examined the research.  We have engaged in extensive consultation and there is very successful implementation and research to prove it.  I have met people who have been involved in the implementation of similar legislation in Sweden.  I have also met the rapporteur who completed an extensive report on the issue in Sweden.  She visited Ireland recently and addressed a seminar on the matter.  Both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have made recommendations in this regard too.  On the basis of that research I have decided that this legislation is the way to go forward.  We need to combat trafficking and its drivers, as I am sure Deputy Wallace will agree.  There is a lot of evidence of wider exploitation of persons involved in prostitution, outside of those trafficked, such as those coerced or otherwise forced through circumstances, to engage in it.  <\/p>  <p>  I accept the point the Deputy makes about the vulnerability of sex workers which is why I have increased the funding for organisations working directly with them.<\/p><p>Interestingly, these organisations also recommended this type of legislation.

No serious action has been suggested in any of the 200 cases reviewed to date.  Will the position change in respect of the remaining 100 cases on which there have not been communications?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000017#P00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1445352000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>The Deputy makes a big assumption in stating the independent review group has not made any serious recommendations.

The Secretary of State has spoken to the British Parliament about the report which deals with the structure, roles and purpose of paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland.  Its conclusions are of concern.  It concludes that all of the main paramilitary groups remain in existence, including the UVF, the UDA, the Red Hand Commando and the Provisional IRA.  It states, &quot;Seventeen years after the 1998 Belfast Agreement, paramilitary groups remain a feature of life&quot; in Northern Ireland and &quot;all of the paramilitary groups maintain a relatively public profile in spite of being illegal organisations&quot;.  These groups have &quot;leadership structures and subgroups across Northern Ireland&quot; and are organised along militaristic lines, using labels such as &quot;brigade&quot; and &quot;army council&quot;.  The report further states:<\/p><blockquote>Members of these paramilitary groups continue to engage in violent activity, both directed by local leadership and conducted without sanction.  Violence and intimidation are used to exercise control at community level.<\/blockquote><p>It states that members of all groups have carried out murders since 1998 and it is further stated that members are involved in other serious criminal activities, which harms communities and damages the financial prosperity and reputation of Northern Ireland.  The report goes on to say that this includes large-scale smuggling operations, fuel laundering, drug dealing and extortion of local businesses.  It also says, very worryingly, that some weapons have not been decommissioned and that all groups have retained capacity in relation to weaponry.  While the report points out a number of positives in the work of the leaders of these various paramilitary groups, it states that despite these positives, \"we judge that individual members of paramilitary groups with a legacy of violent activity still represent a threat to national security, are engaged in organised crime and undermine Northern Ireland's post-conflict transformation\".  The report says that the structures of the Provisional IRA remain in existence, albeit in a much-reduced form.  It includes a senior leadership, the provisional army council, which has an overarching strategy.<\/p> <p> I put it to the Taoiseach that both Governments have taken their eyes off the ball with regard to comprehensively resourcing their intelligence capacity, particularly on the Garda side, and in terms of what has been going in on organised crime and racketeering.  Will a comprehensive, well-resourced joint agency be established at British-Irish Government level to focus on organised crime, particularly by members of paramilitary groups, including fuel laundering and other criminal activities?  Quite some months ago, the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly called for such a joint agency to be established on foot of the assembly's report.  Will the Taoiseach work with the British Government to re-establish the International Monitoring Commission, given the conclusions of the report under discussion that the PSNI does not have the same level of intelligence that it once had and, as such, there is now a need for such a body to be reinstated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000017#P02400","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445352600,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.

[W]e believe that the level of intelligence coverage is proportionate to the threat posed by these groups.  We are confident in our judgements and that these accurately reflect the best intelligence available to us.<\/blockquote><p>The report was commissioned by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on paramilitary groups following the comments made by the Chief Constable of the PSNI.  It was also commissioned following the recent horrific murders in Belfast and the very significant fallout for the political institutions that arose from them.  Governments here, in Northern Ireland and in Britain will examine the assessment very closely.  It clearly raises matters of very serious concern.  There are issues with regard to the existence of illegal organisations and command structures, access to weaponry and widespread criminality.  These things have no place and can have no place in our democracy.  They never did.  The future of the peace process depends on their being removed from life on this island once and for all.  I acknowledge that we have come a long way over the last 15 to 20 years along the road of peaceful resolution of differences.  Everybody can understand that.  We need to complete that process.  I made the Government's position very clear when I spoke in Cambridge some time ago on the matter; 21 years after the IRA's ceasefire, it should no longer carry any capacity for threat.  Statements to the effect that the IRA has gone away or left the stage are simply not credible.  There may have been a time when living with constructive ambiguity helped the peace process, but that time has now passed.  Paramilitarism in all its vestiges must be removed.  I addressed those issues in Cambridge.  I repeat in the House today that after 21 years of the IRA ceasefire and ten years after decommissioning and the IRA announcement, it is past the time when it should carry any capacity for threat.<\/p><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI will continue to work closely together to combat criminality in all its forms on both sides of the Border.  For the information of the House, the Minister for Justice and Equality will publish today the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assessment of paramilitary activities in so far as this jurisdiction is concerned in order that there is a full picture of the respective assessments of the law enforcement agencies on the island.  For his part, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to engage with all parties in Northern Ireland to address these issues.  I note, with regard to what Deputy Martin said, that the issue of dealing with criminality, including criminality as a result of the legacy of paramilitarism, is one that the State takes very seriously.  I note that 134 filling stations have been closed in respect of fuel laundering.  Tobacco smuggling and other issues are a serious priority for the Garda and law and order activities here.<\/p><p>For the information of the House, the DUP has confirmed that its Ministers will be reappointed next Tuesday and that they intend to go back to the talks.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has made it clear that the place to deal with these issues now is these talks, if we are serious about having the institutions work.  For normal politics to apply, one cannot have situations such as those I mentioned.  The place to deal with these is around the table where all parties are involved.  I hope the talks can be very clear, straightforward and frank, and that they will deal with the issues I addressed in Cambridge and that are referred to in the report from the PSNI to the three-person body and in the report to be published later this evening by the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000018#Q00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1445352600,"counter":140,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach did not answer the specific question I asked about the establishment of a British-Irish joint agency to deal with the widespread racketeering, organised crime and smuggling that has been going on for far too long.  The report is very clear that members of these paramilitary groups - the UVF, UDA, Provisional IRA and others - continue to engage in violent activity directed by local leadership and conducted without sanction.  Violence and intimidation are used to exercise control at a community level.  We know this because after the murder of Paul Quinn, not one person came forward.  After the murder of Robert McCartney, no one came forward despite the presence of so many people in a public house.  Why is that?  It is because control is exercised in a very brutal way.  That is not acceptable 17 years after the Good Friday Agreement, and something needs to change.  I put it to the Taoiseach that the Provisional IRA army council still exists despite all the denials we have had.  The investigation into the murder of Kevin McGuigan is ongoing, but it is judged that the assessment put forward by the chief constable in his public statement on 22 August remains accurate.  It also says that all of the groups have committed murders since 1998.  As we know, no one came forward and no one was prosecuted or convicted.<\/p>  <p>  There is a problem here, and both Governments, particularly ours, took their eyes off the ball.  I am told that in the last three to four years the intelligence capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with regard to what is going on along the Border and cross-Border area is not as strong as it should be.  It is under-resourced and not up to speed.  There is a sense that these groups have been allowed to act with impunity.  There are individuals ruling the roost in these areas on a continuing basis and there is a well-established organised criminal network involving individual members of paramilitary groups.  There is a twilight zone there that we cannot get at.  People might not like my saying that, and they may nod their heads, but that is the reality and it is what the report is saying.  I put it to the Taoiseach that a joint body, as recommended by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly some time ago, is needed.  That body said more determined action was required North and South of the Border to eliminate the activities of organised crime gangs involved in cross-Border illicit trading, including the establishment of a permanent full-time multidisciplinary task force.  Our own parliamentarians from Britain and Ireland are saying that something of that order is required.  Will the Taoiseach agree to doing that?  Deputy Brendan Smith has published a fuel laundering Bill and is calling for such legislation.

For instance, there are two cross-Border joint task forces at the moment between the PSNI and the Garda.  The cross-Border tobacco enforcement group includes representatives from the Revenue Commissioners, CAB, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the UK's HM Revenue and Customs, HMRC, and the National Crime Agency.  Obviously, co-operation also takes place with other revenue administrations, such as the European Anti-Fraud Office, or OLAF, as it is called.  Changes were made to the Finance Bills here in 2012 and 2013.  For instance, in February of this year, a joint operation was carried out with HMRC in which 14 premises on both sides of the Border were searched.  It resulted in a total seizure from both jurisdictions of almost 2.5 million cigarettes, 12 tonnes of tobacco and a manufacturing plant, and the arrest of five individuals.  There have been 99 individuals up before CAB, with over &euro;28 million taken from persons in that regard before the Special Criminal Court.<\/p>  <p>  I would also mention that the extent of smuggling and fuel laundering is an issue that has been very much to the fore for the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda and the PSNI.  One hundred and thirty-four filling stations have been closed.<\/p>  <p>  To answer Deputy Martin's question, I am not opposed to it, but I think we should wait for the publication of the report from the Garda by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI should speak.  We should examine in the talks in Belfast the two cross-Border anti-fraud, anti-smuggling, anti-criminal joint task forces that are there at the moment, and if I deemed it necessary or it was deemed appropriate that we should have a further joint operation, then I would not be opposed to it, but what we do need to say very clearly is that the rule of law has to apply, and what has happened, as Deputy Martin well knows, is that the legacy of the Provisional IRA has poisoned society in many cases along the Border.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000019#R00100","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1445353200,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Society in the North has been on a journey from conflict to peace, and it is the responsibility of all political leaders to help to complete that journey.  It is clearly not a task for a hurler on the ditch like the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I wish he would do everyone a service and for once engage positively on the North and the necessary process across this island.<\/p>  <p>  Today, I attended the funerals of Willie Lynch and Tara Gilbert, of their children, Kelsey and Jodie, and their unborn baby, and of Jimmy Lynch, all victims of a fire that killed ten citizens in the Travellers' halting site in Carrickmines.  There were widespread expressions of sympathy after that, which provided some hope that the treatment of Travellers, not just in terms of housing, could begin being addressed in a serious way.  Unfortunately, that hope was dented by the familiar negative attitudes as attempts were made to rehouse the families of the Carrickmines victims.<\/p>  <p>  This underlines the need for a fundamental review of the treatment of Travellers and their community in Irish society, which should be Government-led.  In the past seven years, funding for Traveller accommodation has been cut by 93%.  Some 1,536 families are in overcrowded or unsafe conditions.  Many Travellers have no access to basic facilities such as sanitation, water and electricity.  They fare badly on all key indicators of disadvantage, including unemployment, poverty, health, infant mortality, life expectancy and education.  At the root of all of this are the prejudice, discrimination and social exclusion experienced by these citizens.

The national flag flies at half mast on all public buildings today as a mark of sympathy and solidarity with the families that have lost their loved ones, all ten adults, children and an unborn baby.  Clearly, the issue of Traveller accommodation has been very much to the fore.  An audit is now being carried out of all Traveller halting sites throughout the country.  Deputy Adams will be aware that accommodation is provided for Travellers through a range of measures, including the standard local authority housing financed by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government; Traveller-specific accommodation initiated by the Department; private housing assisted by the State, including local authorities and voluntary organisations; and Travellers' own resources.<\/p>  <p>  The 2014 annual count of Traveller families showed that, of the 10,226 families that were accounted for here, the majority, 35%, were accommodated in standard social housing, 26% were in private rented accommodation, 5% were in assisted private housing, and 6% were housed under their own resources.  Thirteen percent were in group housing, 9% were in shared accommodation, just 1% were in transient sites, and 4% were in unauthorised sites.  Clearly, accommodation is an issue.  I find, having dealt with this over the years, that where communities are engaged with and have the situation explained to them, be it an emergency or not, generally - although not in all cases by any means - there is a willingness to work with local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Adams is aware that the Government will provide funding for Traveller accommodation, but it is best delivered through the local authorities, where the local representatives know the local people and engage with Traveller families that may be accustomed to or have lived in a locality for quite a long time.<\/p>  <p>  As to the point that the Deputy raises about the cross-Border issue, I do not think it is necessary to set up a new forum here.  Both sides of the North-South forum - the ministerial forum - could actually have fed their views to the Traveller accommodation personnel, who would prepare a report on that.  Maybe Deputy Mac Lochlainn does not agree.  I am not sure that having another separate administrative operation is the way to go here.  We have a system that does address a whole range of problems.  I do not see why the Cena group or the Traveller accommodation groups down here could not work with their counterparts and feed in their views through the various Ministers for local government, the environment or whatever.  Perhaps at the next meeting we might have an item on the agenda dealing with this to see how it might proceed.<\/p>  <p>  I take the point about inequality and the treatment of individuals who happen to be Travellers, along with other groups that might be deemed to be fringe groups also.

It is good that the flag is flying at half mast, but this week the Connors family will bury loved ones: Thomas, Sylvia and their children Jim, Christy and Mary.  There is nowhere to live.  The masses will be on Thursday, the burials will be on Friday and the families will still be homeless.  That is our responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  On other issues in the past, the Taoiseach has shown leadership.  He stood up and said that this was what we needed to do.  Our society can be defined by the treatment of these citizens.  The talks with the residents of Rockville Drive continue without resolution ten days later.  It is time for an intervention.  These families will only start to pick up the pieces when the funerals are finished, yet they still have nowhere to go to try to heal, mourn their loved ones and rebuild their lives.<\/p>  <p>  I am suggesting a forum in this State, as there is none.  I suggest that it be an all-Ireland forum, because at least some Travellers are nomadic.  In the North, they have the status of an ethnic minority.  In England, Scotland and Wales, they have the same status, but not here.  I am not suggesting that this would be a cure for all of the problems, but the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality made a number of recommendations that still have not been acted upon 18 months later.  I ask the Taoiseach to intervene and act on this issue.<\/p><p>I will return to what I was suggesting, namely, the bringing together of whomever the Taoiseach believes is appropriate.  I have just made suggestions.  The consultation must clearly involve the Travellers themselves, along with all the other responsible agencies and the Government, to deal with what the Taoiseach said was an issue of inequality.  Some good can come out of these ten dreadful deaths, but only if the Government acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000019#R00400","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445353800,"counter":146,"content":"<p>It will not bring back any of those who lost their lives, obviously.  The carrying out of a national audit will bring its own revelations, I would expect.<\/p>  <p>  A new housing approval body, Cena, has been set up and is to be in operation shortly.  Every local authority has a five-year rolling programme in terms of what it proposes to do about Traveller accommodation, be it through the provision of social housing, private rented housing or halting sites.  There are local Traveller accommodation consultative committees in every local authority area.  They comprise people elected by the people to discuss the question of Traveller accommodation, education, social services, etc.  They assist in the preparation of the five-year programmes that are to be set out and implemented by every local authority.  The National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee is in place.  Its members are appointed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998.  It has an independent chairman and comprises representatives from the various Departments and the County and City Management Association, and it is the national platform for Traveller accommodation consultation.  It supports the local Traveller accommodation committees, it commissions relevant research on Traveller issues, such as those raised by the Deputy, and it provides an advisory role regarding national policy and strategy issues.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the unfortunate tragedy that occurred in Carrickmines, the programme to review fire safety and Traveller accommodation is always of particular importance.  Some authorities have held initial meetings about the plan to prepare for the review or to take appropriate action to improve the position in halting sites or other forms of Traveller accommodation.  That is not yet finalised.<\/p>  <p>  There is a national body but the point is that while it is all very well to talk in here, it is the making of decisions that will allow for Traveller accommodation to be provided that meets resistance.  I would have believed that, following this horrific tragedy in Carrickmines, the local authority wanting to put in place temporary accommodation for a six-month period in a location close to where the temporary halting site has been in place for eight years would have been acceptable under the conditions set out.  I regret that has not happened.  There are probably still discussions ongoing between the local authority and the people living there.  I assure the Deputy that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, devoted considerable time to trying to achieve closure on this in the hope that the matter might have been sorted out before the funerals.  Unfortunately, it has not been.  Therefore, it is a question of being able to make decisions that will allow for appropriate accommodation and the provision of all the necessary facilities for Traveller people.  After all, they are of the same nationality as ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000020#S00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1445353800,"counter":147,"content":"<p>The majority of Irish people no longer have confidence in NAMA.

It provides leadership and strategic direction in fulfilling the Department's broad range of business and corporate responsibilities.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to supporting the constitutional functions of the Taoiseach and the Government and assisting the Chief Whip and three other Ministers of State, the Department of the Taoiseach is heavily involved in the formulation and implementation of Government policy across the full range of domestic, EU and international agendas.<\/p>  <p>  For example, in 2014, the Department dealt with 58 Government meetings involving 952 Government memoranda, 76 Cabinet committee meetings, 20,000 pieces of correspondence, 805 parliamentary questions and 173 freedom of information requests.  It also provided support for speeches, 220 functions, 190 meetings, 25 overseas trips and more than 100 press events attended by me.<\/p>  <p>  The Department's MAC comprises senior managers in the Department at Secretary General and assistant secretary level as well as the Department's head of corporate services and personnel officer.  The minutes of the Department's MAC are circulated to all staff and also published quarterly on the Department's website.  There is also regular and ongoing interaction on management issues between me, the Ministers of State in the Department and the senior management team, including through the Cabinet committee structure and other forums.<\/p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Civil Service renewal plan in 2014, the Civil Service Management Board was established.  The board is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach and comprises all Secretaries General and heads of major offices.  It is overseeing implementation across the Civil Service of all the actions in the renewal plan.  The board meets monthly and the minutes of its meetings are available on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for Civil Service renewal.  Last July, he published a report setting out progress achieved on Civil Service renewal in the first 200 days, including in the following priority areas.  First, the accountability board has been established to bring together Civil Service, ministerial and external perspectives on Civil Service performance.  It held its first meeting in July and will meet again in November.  Second, a performance review process for Secretaries General has been approved and will be introduced for the next performance year, 2016.  Third, options to strengthen the disciplinary code have been identified and a revised code developed, which is currently subject to the normal staff consultation process.  Fourth, open recruitment campaigns have been held across most Civil Service grades.  Fifth, the first Civil Service-wide staff engagement survey, involving more than 38,000 employees, commenced in September to get staff input and to provide a benchmark to measure and compare different Departments.<\/p>  <p>  Work is continuing on delivery of all the actions in the three-year plan with the focus for the next 200 days on the priority areas of strengthening the performance management process for all grades; implementation of a new programme of organisational capability reviews to review the capacity and capability of each Department; publicly recognising staff excellence and innovation, including holding the first Civil Service excellence and innovation awards event later this year; expanding career and mobility opportunities across the Civil Service; improving the delivery of shared whole-of-government projects; strengthening Civil Service communications; and the roll-out of a common corporate governance standard for all Departments and offices.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Civil Service renewal plan, a draft corporate governance standard for Departments has been developed and published for consultation.  Once finalised and agreed by Government, this will require each Department to produce a governance framework setting out the Department's standards of conduct, values and principles of good governance by which it operates.

I believe the opposite is the reality.  Ireland's civil servants rank highly in international terms and, generally speaking, they show great dedication and commitment to public service and to their country.  There is a need for ongoing reform but the programme announced last year by the Taoiseach will not, as he said, transform the Civil Service.  It will implement many important improvements, just as many other programmes have done.<\/p>  <p>  The Civil Service Management Board has announced that it will publish a code of practice for special advisers and one element of that is supposed to be a cooling-off period following departure from political service.  Will the Taoiseach explain if he is happy with the idea that political special advisers are now eligible to be appointed to permanent senior Civil Service jobs?  We have just seen the situation arise where a person who served as a political adviser in this Government up to the middle of last year, and before that for nine years worked directly in a political party, has been appointed as an assistant secretary, a permanent post carrying a starting salary of &euro;120,000 per annum.  Is the Taoiseach happy with that?  Is he comfortable with the idea that, notwithstanding the code of practice the management board is coming up with, someone can go from a senior political job to a senior Civil Service job while the Government he served is still in office?<\/p>  <p>  In addition to that, in the programme for Government there is a commitment to introduce a reformed incentive system for all grades in all Departments to reward cross-departmental teams that deliver audited improvements in service delivery and cost-effectiveness.  Most disability groups will confirm that is not working and that commitment has not been delivered upon.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would also say whether all delegation orders to spell out functions of Ministers are in order?<\/p>  <p>  Is it acceptable or reforming that minutes are still not being taken at meetings the Taoiseach and other members of Government attend?

The minutes of the board are available on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but I can only find records up until May.  Were any meetings held after May?  If so, when can we expect the minutes of these meetings to be posted?<\/p><p>The Taoiseach made the point that this Civil Service management board has a key role in the Civil Service renewal plan and in the reform under way.  The nub of this is contained in an earlier response from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, when he stated:<\/p><blockquote>Public Service Reform is a key element of the Government's overall strategy for recovery.  Led by my Department, the reforms delivered over the past four years have enabled us to maintain and improve public services in the face of the necessary reduction in staff numbers and budgets, at a time of increased demand for public services.<\/blockquote><p>That is the nub.  I agree that the public service - the Civil Service, in particular - is generally speaking a good service and that the people who work in it do their very best.  However, the Government's austerity programme has reduced staff numbers, cut budgets and cut the funding for public services significantly.  Is that not at the nub of some of the difficulties?<\/p><p>We have some of the highest rates of low pay in the developed world.  To put it better, we have some of the lowest rates of pay in the developed world in this State.  Given that the Government is the largest employer in the State, has the Taoiseach considered introducing a living wage of &euro;11.45 throughout the Civil Service?  Would that not increase morale and ensure greater productivity by civil servants?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000022#U00400","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1445355000,"counter":191,"content":"<p>The Government has tried to be practical and prudent in the allocation of resources made available by the people through their sacrifices in recent years.  While not every expectation could be met, the Government has, within the resources available to it, tried to prioritise the areas involved in this case.<\/p>  <p>  One of the first decisions made by the Government was to reverse the cut in the minimum wage, which brought another 300,000 back into that.  We followed that with the setting up of the Low Pay Commission.  This was the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Nash.  There was a reason for this.  Previously, we had a haphazard and uncertain system of determining wage increases for lower paid workers.  The Low Pay Commission did a good job in pointing out the critical points where consideration should be given for an increase in wages.  When the commission was launched earlier this year by myself, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, we said that when it reported the Government would respond through the budget.  That has happened.  By way of balance we know that, for example, when lower paid workers reach the level of &euro;352 per week, they would be worse off getting an increase to the minimum wage unless they received an adjustment in PRSI.  Clearly, in that regard we need a balance for employers in order that the burden does not fall unduly on the employer and we responded to that in the budget.  I would like to think that the best opportunity to deal with lower wages and increase a person's potential is to have upskilling, retraining and a better job.  The living wage is something that I accept in principle, of course.  However, I would like to think that we could give greater opportunity to those who work and demonstrate that work actually pays - for them that is the way it should be.<\/p>  <p>  Some points may be of interest to Deputy Adams.  In the first 200 days of the plan a number of things have changed across the Civil Service.  Open recruitment campaigns were held for principal officer, assistant principal officer, administrative officer, executive officer and clerical officer grades in the Civil Service.  They have built on existing arrangements.  Options to strengthen the disciplinary code were identified and a revised code was drafted as a consequence.  A total of 11 town hall events were held throughout the country, including in Dublin, Wexford, Kilkenny, Galway, Sligo, Cork and Athlone.  Events for Dundalk and Limerick are scheduled.  The primary purpose of the meetings held, and to be held, is to take observations and suggestions from members of the Civil Service and build confidence and trust.  These events facilitate regional input into the Civil Service renewal plan and allow staff an opportunity to network outside their normal office space.  A panel consisting of senior civil servants facilitated discussions with audience questions.  The issues raised included mobility within the Civil Service, open recruitment, learning and development and where opportunities exist for self-betterment.  The first mobility policy for senior managers at principal officer level was agreed and the first moves are expected shortly.  This builds on the existing mobility programme at assistant secretary level.  A chief human resources officer was appointed.  A total of 13 open policy debates have been held to date.  These have involved policy networks, practitioners, academics and experts in a range of policy areas.  The topics covered include education reform, national risk assessment, a labour market symposium and future investment in early years education.<\/p>  <p>  A Civil Service customer satisfaction survey was completed by 2,000 people and published in May 2015.  The survey results highlighted strong and stable satisfaction levels.  The first Civil Service engagement survey involved 38,000 people.  A proposed model for learning and development to improve capability through enhanced procurement and shared delivery of training throughout the Civil Service was agreed.  The Civil Service excellence in innovation awards is a new annual event to recognise staff excellence and innovation in the Civil Service.  As Deputy Martin pointed out, the reputation of our Civil Service is exceptionally high.<\/p>  <p>  A common corporate governance standard for all Departments has been developed for the first time.  This will be finalised following public consultation.  The approach for a new programme for organisational capability to review capacity and capability has been agreed in respect of every Department.  An information and communications technology strategy to deliver more online services and better outcomes in efficiency through innovation and excellence in ICT was published in the first quarter of this year and implementation is under way.  An enhanced performance review process for assistant secretaries has been developed and is being piloted by four Departments in quarter 3 of 2015.  That is progress and represents active engagement from the Civil Service in respect of how things might be improved with a view to services being provided more efficiently and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000022#U00500","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Records","time":1445355600,"counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000023#V00050"},{"type":"question","time":1445355600,"counter":193,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[15215\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000023#V00100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the formal processes and mechanisms for documenting decisions made within his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","time":1445355600,"counter":194,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[31706\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000023#V00200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he is satisfied that the standard of record keeping in his Department, including the maintenance of minutes of meetings, is adequate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1445355600,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.<\/p>  <p>  Records in my Department are created and held in compliance with the provisions of the Data Protection Acts, the Freedom of information Act and the National Archives Act.

It would seem to suggest that there is wriggle room for him and others to decide the taking of minutes may not be appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  In his constant drive to avoid being accountable, the Taoiseach has, of course, refused to answer detailed questions in the House about his role in the departure of the former Garda Commissioner.  Central to the evidence heard by Mr. Justice Fennelly is that not only did he not keep minutes of his discussions, he did not even record a decision, in particular a crucial meeting at which the Taoiseach was present along with the Secretary General of his Department, the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Attorney General.  A serious decision was taken at that meeting to send the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality to the Commissioner's house with a message that the Taoiseach may not have confidence in him the following morning.  The judge is absolutely scathing of the fact that there is no record or minutes of the meeting or of the decision taken.  No one took minutes of the discussions.  I suggest that is how one can end up with the situation whereby the majority of those present at the meeting end up disagreeing with the Taoiseach's evidence.  One person went as far as to describe the Taoiseach's story as a fantasy.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's failure to keep a single record of what he admits were a gravely serious set of meetings goes 100% against the statement he has just made and he has repeatedly made during Question Time over the past four years.  He said to me that under him every meeting would be minuted, even if he was talking to a constituency delegation.  He used a colourful phrase at one stage.  A delegation from a constituency came to speak to him, during which he thumped the table and he said even that was recorded.  He said no meeting would be too small to record everything in minutes. <\/p>  <p>  Some three or four years ago he made a nasty slur against his predecessor and used innuendo to the effect that records could have been disappeared and so on.  He belatedly withdrew that statement two years later and said he should not have said it, even though the decision his predecessor took had 149 documents backing it up.  The Taoiseach has said consistently that he wants the full minutes of everything that was discussed.<\/p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach explain why, at the meeting between him, the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Secretaries General of his Department and the Department of Justice and Equality and the Attorney General, the standards upon which he insisted were not met?  Can he accept that his failure to ensure any record was kept leaves us a conflict of evidence, whereby a member of his party has said his evidence was fantasy?  Surely that is a real step backwards rather than the proper reform which he advocated.  Does the Taoiseach regret that no minutes were taken or record kept of what was an extremely important meeting, leading as it did to a commission of investigation having to be established?  Mr. Justice Fennelly is absolutely scathing in his report about the absence of any record of the meeting.  Does the Taoiseach apologise for no record being kept and regret the fact no minutes of meeting exist?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000023#V00400","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1445355600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin referred to accountability.

The Taoiseach has frequently praised the work of the Economic Management Council because it supposedly keeps a very close eye on all economic and fiscal issues.  Does he not agree that given the lack of progress on homelessness and housing it seems the Economic Management Council, despite having 15 meetings in more recent times, is not in as much control of the situation as the Taoiseach might have thought previously?  Despite economic growth, more than 1,500 children, an 80% increase, live in emergency accommodation and up to 5,000 people are homeless.  There is policy chaos around housing and homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  The Economic Management Council must keep a close eye on the fiscal situation, but on the Friday before the budget approximately &euro;700 million was allocated to health on top of last year's &euro;600 million supplementary budget.  There seems to be either gross mismanagement or deliberate fraudulent estimates in health at the outset of the year, where clearly the budgets allocated are not realistic, adequate or robust enough, despite what the Minister says at the beginning of every year.  Last year, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, stated he had received enough.  Clearly he did not and neither did he get enough the previous year.  Does the Taoiseach believe the model of the Economic Management Council is adequate, because the health services are in chaos?  There is no stability in our health services at present.  They are in chaos.  Morale is very low.  Staffing and supports have been under-resourced.  We pointed out to the Taoiseach four key areas where savings revenue could be raised to support health services, including the recouping of fees from private medical insurers, agency staff, drug procurement and a tax on sugar sweetened drinks.  We backed this up with research from the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Fiscal Advisory Council, the Department of Finance's report and the Revenue Commissioners with regard to a tax on sugar sweetened drinks.<\/p>  <p>  The Economic Management Council's grip and impact on policy seems to be less and less influential.  We have no idea about the extension of free GP care to 12 year olds because the money allocated does not go anywhere near a full extension.  One wonders if it is like the promises made five years ago, in that they are not real in the sense of any commitment to implement them over the coming 12 months.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, has already clarified that not every child will be covered by the child care commitment in the budget and that it will be September at the earliest before the programme is introduced.  Is the Economic Management Council overseeing all of this?  The money needed to fulfil commitments made by Ministers is not provided, with the result that we have budgetary figures which are best open to question and, in some instances such as health, are in my view clearly very dishonest.<\/p><p>I do not know how the Economic Management Council of the Cabinet can stand over what has happened in health budgets over the past three years, particularly their inaccuracy, dishonesty and falsity.

We were given a phrase along the lines of \"probity controls\" and nobody knew what it meant.  To be fair to the Minister at the time, Deputy Reilly, he said he could not stand over the figures the day after the budget was announced.  The Economic Management Council and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform stood over them.  What happened?  When we went forward seven or eight months, it transpired that those figures were never going to be anywhere near meeting the need.  That caused chaos and distress for many families, and the same has happened over the past 12 months.  There has been much distress caused to front-line workers in the health area because they were told to operate within a budget.<\/p>  <p>  Late one night, a white paper or a Supplementary Estimate was produced, releasing an extra &euro;1.5 billion, and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was not even told about it.  There was much hype on a day when &euro;1.5 billion was given out, involving presentations and media handlers, but in the previous four or five days, another &euro;1.5 billion was given out and there was not a word about it in that we cannot get information about it.  We had to go searching for that information about what it is for and what Departments would be affected.  Over the past three years, the Government's handling of the fiscal position in health has been disgraceful.  I am very clear that it has been dishonest, in my view, as the Government wanted to get its figures right on the tax front.  It was a certain political operation for the budgets for the past three years and health was getting in the way.  These were never real figures for the health sector.<\/p>  <p>  That has been going on and there is a need for a very honest debate about our health services, particularly about what they need.  The HSE has not got the required level of funding to perform the level of services that the Government wanted it to perform over the past three years.  Nobody can dispute that reality, as there has been a chronic mismatch between the level of services that people want and which the Government has ordained should happen against the resources put to that end.  Despite meeting 15 times, the Economic Management Council has allowed chaos to reign in health, as well as in housing and homeless policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000025#X01500","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1445356800,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  When the Government was elected to office, the economic position was very precarious.  We were blocked from international markets, interest rates were 15% and we were haemorrhaging jobs by the hundred thousand.  Unemployment was at 15.2%, with national debt rising and the deficit at &euro;22.5 billion.  Given the changes, decisions and sacrifices accepted by the people, we are now in a very different position and we hope to have the deficit eliminated by the end of 2017 or early 2018.  That will bring about a very different scenario for the country, whoever the people decide to elect in the mean time.<\/p>  <p>  I have always considered that the operation of the Government in this case involves two parties, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party.  With respect, one of the important issues at a time of crisis was that the leaders of the parties - with a Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform working in the financial area - had regular contact, updates and dialogue, meaning that everybody knew, as the issue evolved from day to day or week to week, what decisions needed to be looked at and made.  I have said it before publicly that the Governor of the Central Bank said to me that it was quite likely that in a particular week it could have been necessary to put the Army around automated teller machines and tell people that capital controls would have to be introduced, which would have been absolutely disastrous for people in Ireland.  That was avoided.  The purpose of the Economic Management Council was to have continuous engagement where it was necessary and appropriate.  In its own way, it had an impact on keeping the discipline and character of the Government very much focused on the job we had to do.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has raised a couple of serious issues, including homelessness.  It is not acceptable that 1,500 children should not have a home to go to.  It is unacceptable.  The problem is that the total collapse of the construction sector meant we were coming from a very low base.  As Deputies know, we were building 90,000 houses per year and that dropped to approximately 8,500 per year.  It needs to be approximately 20,000 or 25,000 for a number of years in order to deal with the issue, so it will not be sorted out in the short term.  Through Cabinet sub-committees and the Ministers responsible for the environment, finance and others, there have been a series of decisions about what needs to be done.  Decisions were made at the Cabinet sub-committee and referenced through the Economic Management Council to the Cabinet last year in respect of homelessness and rough sleepers on the streets.  These dealt with the purchase of the night caf&eacute;, extra resources given to homelessness housing agencies and so on.  That made a big difference but the matter is now very challenging and it must be dealt with through the social housing scheme, which is nationwide, with money on the table.  With regard to private rented accommodation, the Department of Social Protection is in a position to assist in each individual case where there is pressure on a tenancy.  There is also the restoration of what are called \"voids\", or places that were not habitable; they are being done up and made comfortable for people.  The Minister is proceeding to use his authority under the Acts to expedite modular housing in two tranches of 150 and 350.  I hope he will have a modest number in position by the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  This is not an acceptable position.  The construction sector can give a response that must be practical and incentivised, and there should be a return in that case.  We have spoken about development levies and the building regulations, as distinct from planning regulations, which are completely independent.  There are questions, for example, as to whether one needs two or three car spaces per bedroom in units and other issues also must be addressed, such as requirements for fire safety conditions and so on.  Getting this moving is a multi-edged challenge.  It is not a question of money but managing the resource to make it happen.  We can consider the thousands of planning applications that contractors will not commence because there is no return because of development levies and the extent of building regulations etc.  These issues must be examined.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly; his Minister of State, Deputy Coffey; the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin; and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, are working very hard in that area-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000025#X01600","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1445356800,"counter":258,"content":"<p>It is chaotic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000025#X01700","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1445356800,"counter":259,"content":"<p>-----but I would like to see results as quickly as we can.<\/p><p>The Deputy mentioned the health area.

Of course, it is always difficult with demand-led services where a population is growing at the more senior level and where there is a greater demand for health services.  Next year, as Deputy Martin is aware, we are out of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  There will no longer be an opportunity to have Supplementary Estimates.  If money falls short in any Department, it will have to be made up either from savings in another Department or within the Department itself.  That is a very changed situation.  In respect of the allocations made in the Supplementary Estimates going into each Department, obviously the growth in the economy has been very strong.  Many of these were commitments in any event, and for 2016, Ministers were able to stay within the terms set out in the spring statement.  Having said that, there are still clearly pressures and demands in many Departments and it has not been possible for Government to meet all the demands.

It was originally established, as the Taoiseach has outlined, with the status of a Cabinet committee to manage the Government's programme on economic planning, budgetary matters and banking policy coming out of the crash.  I can understand, to a certain degree, the logic of that and the need to have a focus on those matters.  However, it appears that its power and influence have grown, in so far as it is possible to tell from the opaque answers we sometimes get to questions to establish this.  It appears that the EMC acts almost as a Government within the Government and then brings forward its decisions to the Cabinet, and also that some of the senior people - civil servants and political advisers - who attend these meetings may well have more influence on the decisions taken than do members of the Cabinet itself.  There is a question about whether the role, the decisions and the actions of the economic council are replacing the constitutional responsibility of the Cabinet.<\/p>  <p>  There are also big issues that need to be dealt with.  There are hundreds of citizens on hospital trolleys.  Has the economic council discussed that?  There is the issue of rent certainty or the lack thereof.  Has the economic council discussed that?  There is an ongoing issue around the lack of Government plans to tackle the housing and homelessness crisis.  The Taoiseach says that homelessness is not acceptable.  With absolute respect, let me say that homelessness is a direct consequence of his Government's policy and it is acceptable to the Government.  It would not be happening if the Taoiseach decided to stop it happening and if he got houses built for those people who need them.  I raised the plight of the Traveller community earlier.  Its accommodation funding was cut by 93%.  Imagine - a 93% cut.  Did the Economic Management Council take that decision?<\/p>  <p>  I asked question No. 7.  I do not recall the Taoiseach answering it, although he may have and I may have missed it, and if so, I apologise.  I asked him to confirm whether the Governor of the Central Bank briefed the EMC on the possible implications of a Greek exit from the European Union and the euro.  If he has not answered that, I would be obliged if he would tell us whether that happened.

Whoever they are should be sacked.  We are facing the worst housing and homelessness crisis in the modern history of the State.  No matter how much the Government talks about it and makes announcements, it gets worse on a daily basis.  Under the Taoiseach's stewardship, the housing lists have gone from 96,000 to 130,000.  That is a disastrous failure by any definition.  The number of children and families living in homelessness increased exponentially.  Waiting lists have gone from approximately eight or nine years, which was bad, to 18 years.  The wait is 18 years in D&uacute;n Laoghaire if one joins the housing list now.<\/p>  <p>  This is an index of disastrous failure, which is now not just affecting people who would traditionally have had difficulty affording a home, but is reaching up into every sector of society.  Nobody who is not very rich can afford to put a roof over his or her head.  That is where we are at.  Anybody who finds themselves, for whatever reason, without a roof over their head and looking for one, is, by definition, in trouble, unless they are earning &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000 a year, which most people are not.  We now have the phenomenon of the working homeless, people who are going out to work and are sleeping in different hostels on different nights, trying to do a full day's work while not knowing where they will be sleeping that night.  That is what is going on.  It is beyond belief.<\/p>  <p>  I am asking what advice the Economic Management Council is getting on this.  The Taoiseach made a very telling statement on budget day: when asked about rent controls, he said that while he was looking at the matter - we keep looking at these matters but doing nothing about them - he would not be doing anything that would interfere with the market.  In other words, it was an economic decision that was informing his refusal to introduce rent controls.  As he well knows, one of the major contributory factors to the homelessness and housing crisis is spiralling rents that are unaffordable and consequent evictions, or the inability of people to access affordable housing, because we are essentially dependent on the private sector.  Is this not the problem?  Whatever advice or economic doctrine the Taoiseach is working on is telling him we must not interfere with the market, and that is the fundamental problem; in fact, we absolutely must interfere with the market.  He needs some advice from somebody who will tell him that we desperately need to interfere with the market and that we must not allow the market to dictate this issue or imagine that the market is going to solve it, when he has pursued this policy of hoping the market will sort the problem out for the entire duration of this Government and the market has self-evidently not sorted the problem out.  Does the Taoiseach accept that?  Does he accept that the advice is wrong, the policy has been wrong and the problem is continuously getting worse?  If we do not get that admission, we are on a hiding to nothing in terms of a chronic situation.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, on the economics of housing, the Taoiseach keeps saying that we need to increase supply.  First of all, it has not happened.  He keeps referring to the fact that we built 90,000 houses during the boom and now building has dropped to abysmal levels, so what we need to do is get supply up.  Would he acknowledge the basic economic point, and does the EMC even discuss this point - that even when we were building 90,000 houses per year, mostly private, during the boom, the housing crisis was still getting worse?  The numbers on the housing list were increasing even then.  The idea that supply equals demand - this economic notion - is just nonsense.  Is the Taoiseach getting any contrarian advice, to use the Nyberg phrase, in the aftermath of the analysis of economic crash?  Is he getting any contrarian advice that is challenging the orthodoxy-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000026#Y00800","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1445357400,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Just allow for a reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000026#Y00900","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1445357400,"counter":271,"content":"<p>-----that supply equals demand, because it clearly does not?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000026#Y01000","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1445357400,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Deputy Adams raised the point about the Economic Management Council and whether it was assuming the constitutional responsibility of the Cabinet.

It is not assuming any constitutional responsibility beyond its remit and any recommendation from the Economic Management Council has to be validated, verified and accepted by the entire Cabinet.<\/p> <p> The sub-committee on health discusses the issues surrounding health with the relevant Ministers from different Departments on a cross-departmental basis and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform would have met each of the Ministers individually in regard to their proposals for what they required in regard to the final decision to be taken as to what they would be allocated.<\/p> <p> I cannot recall at which meeting, if any, that the Governor might have briefed on the Greek exit, although on a number of occasions the Cabinet discussed that matter as to what might happen.<\/p> <p> There were 15 meetings of the EMC last year and while the EMC worked with the banks, there were three meetings with the banks.

Many of the problems stem from the chronic lack of supply of housing which causes a knock-on problem across the property market and wider society, from renters to first-time buyers to low-income households, and the only sustainable solution is to increase the supply of affordable housing generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000026#Y01100","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445358000,"counter":274,"content":"<p>It did not work during the boom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000027#Z00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1445358000,"counter":275,"content":"<p>If there is a room available in D&uacute;n Laoghaire for rent and there are 20 persons looking for it, clearly, the owner has a choice who to give that to and, as a consequence, rent rises.

Work is under way on replacing section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 and enactment is expected in early 2016.  The amendment to section 4 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 to address the discriminatory treatment of persons whose decision making capacity is in question.  On the deprivation of liberty, legislative clarity is required on nursing homes and similar residential care facilities which have statutory responsibility for a decision that a patient should not leave for health and safety reasons and the appeals processes that should be in place.  Section 42 of the Electoral Act 1992 regarding the ineligibility of a \"person of unsound mind\" to stand for election will require careful consideration and the position must be published.  Given that the term \"person of unsound mind\" is gone, the legislation must be dealt with.  Ireland has taken the view that we should publish and deal with the necessary legislation before we ratify the convention, and this is set out in the road map we approved today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000028#AA00900","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1445358600,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Scrap and precious metal thieves are roaming the countryside, and I have been a victim of them.

Above all, it focused on the complex challenge of migration.  It is clear that major problems remain on the ground.  This has been underscored in the past few days.  However, significant progress has been made in a short period.  A structured and comprehensive approach is now in place to deal with the many urgent challenges that lie ahead.  Last week's meeting began with short discussions on the five presidents' report on completing economic and monetary union and on the United Kingdom's plans for a referendum on EU membership.  It was agreed that we will return to both issues in December.  President Hollande made a presentation in advance of the global conference of the parties on climate change, which will open next month in Paris.  The European Council also noted the publication of the international and independent report into the downing of flight MH17 over Ukraine.  I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, to touch on elements of the discussions on Syria, climate change and Ukraine in his wrap-up remarks.  As I have noted, the European Council spent an overwhelming amount of its time on migration.  Therefore, I will begin by speaking about that issue.<\/p><p>The European Council has dealt with migration on a number of occasions this year, including in March, April, June and September.  If further reminder of the scale of the challenge were needed, it came when the <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>rescued 102 people off the coast of Libya on the morning of the Council meeting of 15 October. The achievements of the Naval Service in the past six months are a source of great pride for the Irish people.  I know I speak for the entire House when I express our deep thanks and admiration for their wonderful work.  Nevertheless, the challenge remains.  The European Commission came forward with a comprehensive range of important proposals in September and October.  They provided the framework for the Council&rsquo;s discussions.  Ireland has consistently argued that the Union&rsquo;s efforts must be comprehensive and must balance practical measures with a compassionate response.  Our calls for solidarity and responsibility are reflected in the Council&rsquo;s conclusions, which aim towards a comprehensive strategy and a determined and sustained effort over time.<\/p><p>One of the central components of last week's discussions was the need to co-operate with third countries.  Turkey is paramount in this regard.  The Commission has accelerated co-operation in recent weeks.  On the eve of the European Council, it negotiated an action plan which aims to support Turkey in its current challenge of hosting over 2 million refugees from Syria and to enlist its assistance in reducing migration flows.  The Turkish Government has spent some &euro;7 billion in this area.  The European Council gave its support to the Commission by welcoming the action plan and signalling its openness to helping Turkey to work within existing frameworks towards visa liberalisation and a range of forms of enhanced political and economic co-operation.  It was recognised that the accession process needs to be re-energised in accordance with the negotiating structures.  The relevant Council conclusions which set out the accession procedures and criteria must also be respected.  The Council underscored that the comprehensive co-operation agenda must be based on shared responsibility, mutual commitments and delivery on both sides.  I do not think anyone is under any illusions about how challenging it will be for all concerned to achieve the substantive step-up in relations that is now envisaged.  As Turkey plays a geographically and politically central role in its region and is an EU neighbour and candidate country, it is hard to imagine solutions to the current crisis that do not substantially involve it.  Therefore, we hope rapid progress can be made over the coming period on the issues set out in the action plan.<\/p><p>Discussions also touched on the recent conference on the western Balkans migratory route and on the upcoming Valletta summit.  This latter summit will aim to find agreement with African partners in a fair and balanced manner on how to tackle the root causes of the crisis, how to support development, how to provide for effective return and readmission and how to dismantle the criminal networks that are exploiting this situation and putting lives in danger.  The European Council noted the importance of funding for international efforts to support refugees in Turkey and other countries.  The WFP and the UNHCR were specifically mentioned in this regard.  Ireland is a significant donor and partner to both of these organisations.  The European Council also discussed strengthening and protecting the EU&rsquo;s external borders.  This was a matter of serious discussion.  The measures discussed in this context dealt largely with building on the Schengen system and enhancing the borders agency, Frontex.  Although it co-operates closely with its European partners, Ireland is not a member of the Schengen area or of Frontex.  Many of the issues raised, such as the possibility of a European border and coast guard system, are for other member states to consider in the first instance.<\/p><p>When the Council looked at the response to the influx of refugees in Europe, there was a focus on contributing member state personnel to support Frontex and the European asylum support office in the so-called &quot;hotspots&quot;, or emergency processing centres, in Greece and Italy.  Ireland recently decided to commit six experts to the European asylum support office.  Preparations are under way for their training and eventual deployment to the member states where they can be of most assistance.  The Council did not discuss any specific further relocation initiative, but instead resolved to keep the whole issue under review.  The Commission has proposed a permanent relocation system.  Under Protocol 21 to the Lisbon treaty,  Ireland can choose whether to opt in to relocation measures.  As this House knows, we have agreed to accept approximately 2,450 people on relocation within the EU.  However, there is no obligation on us to participate in further relocation decisions if they are proposed.  Ireland will monitor the situation carefully with a view to considering any further national response as and when the issue arises.<\/p><p>There was also some discussion of the Dublin system under which asylum seekers are supposed to register and make applications in the first EU country they enter.  This is a cornerstone of the whole common European asylum system and Ireland strongly supports it.  It is clear that it has been under intolerable strain in the face of the immense pressure of recent weeks and months, but equally there is a view that much can be done to improve its operation and that any reform must be carefully analysed before change is contemplated.  Again, this is a matter to which I am sure we will return on the basis of European Commission analysis and proposals.<br\/><br\/>The Council discussion also included a consideration of the political and military developments in Syria which have such a dominating impact on migration.  I want to draw attention to the Council&rsquo;s clear statement that the Assad regime bears the greatest responsibility for the 250,000 deaths and the displacement of millions from Syria.  There are, of course, other actors such as UN-designated terrorist groups who bear responsibility as well but in the end it will only be a political process on the basis of the Geneva Communique of 2012 that will move matters towards a resolution.  The EU remains fully engaged in working to find a political solution in close co-operation with the UN, with special representative Staffan de Mistura and with the countries of the region.  I would reiterate again, as the European Council did, that there cannot be a lasting peace in Syria under the current leadership and until the legitimate grievances and aspirations of all components of Syrian society are addressed.  In the context of discussing regional conflicts, the European Council also noted developments in Libya and called on all parties to swiftly endorse the agreement negotiated by Bernadino Le&oacute;n.  The EU stands ready to provide political and financial support to the Libyan Government of national accord as soon as it takes office.<br\/><br\/>I would like to recall again that Ireland has been active in ongoing efforts to tackle the migration crisis.  The Government and the Oireachtas have voluntarily agreed to accept around 4,000 asylum seekers and refugees under resettlement and relocation programmes.  This is well in excess of any notional quota that might have been attributed to us by the European Commission.  This includes 520 refugees whom we have offered to resettle from refugee camps, some of whom have now started arriving in Ireland.  Approximately 2,450 people will be relocated from Italy and Greece and possibly other member states under the Commission proposals from June and September.  A further 1,030 people will be taken on resettlement or relocation, with the final breakdown between these two categories still under consideration.  As I noted earlier, we have deployed a naval vessel and full crew in the Mediterranean since June; initially the <i>LE Eithne<\/i>, then the <i>LE Niamh<\/i>and now the <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>.  The total number of people rescued by our naval vessels since May now comes to 7,848 and I commend the Naval Service again on its very admirable work.<br\/><br\/>The European Council discussions touched upon the work of two UN agencies.  This year, Ireland&rsquo;s core funding to the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, came to &euro;5.8 million.  Furthermore, at the start of September, we committed to doubling our annual contribution to the World Food Programme from &euro;10 million to &euro;20 million per annum for the next three years.  We also provide other supports to areas most affected by instability and conflict.  By the end of 2015, Ireland will have provided a total of &euro;41 million over the last four years towards assisting those displaced as a result of the Syrian crisis.  The Irish Government provides over &euro;80 million each year to humanitarian relief efforts around the world.  So far in 2015, Ireland&rsquo;s targeted humanitarian funding has reached people in countries such as Iraq, South Sudan, Somalia, the Central African Republic and Yemen.  All of these measures have been supported by a swift response at home led by the Department of Justice and Equality.  The establishment of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and a new inter-departmental task force, chaired by the Minister for Justice and Equality, are important steps in the Government&rsquo;s contribution to this crisis.<br\/><br\/>I would now like to turn to the issue of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s membership of the European Union.  As expected, at last week&rsquo;s meeting President Tusk provided Heads of State and Government with a brief update on the progress of the technical work that has been under way in Brussels between British and EU officials since June.  In addition, he outlined how the process will advance in the weeks ahead before the European Council returns to this issue in December.  Much of the recent focus has been on the need to move forward to more detailed debate on concrete issues.  I welcome, therefore, Prime Minister Cameron&rsquo;s undertaking last week to write to President Tusk in early November setting out the reforms that Britain will seek.  This should provide a basis for the UK&rsquo;s EU partners to engage more fully with the issues and to allow for collective discussion.  Ireland will play a full part in this process, which is expected to start at senior official level, and I look forward to discussions at the December European Council.<br\/><br\/>As I have said many times in this House and in other fora, the matter of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s membership of the European Union is one of real national importance for Ireland.  Indeed, this issue is a strategic priority for the Government.  In my own discussions with Prime Minister Cameron, I have been unequivocal about how much value we attach to the fact that both our countries are members of the European Union.  Given the importance of the issue, it is worth stressing once again just how closely developments are being monitored.  In addition to my own discussions with Prime Minister Cameron, there are regular meetings between Government Ministers and their British equivalents.  Indeed, the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs will meet with his British counterpart this Friday.  At official level, the engagement is equally regular, with officials in my Department, our permanent representation in Brussels and our embassy in London in frequent contact with British and other colleagues.  In all of these exchanges we remain clear and consistent on our position that Ireland will be open and pragmatic.  We are mindful of specific UK concerns and we will be supportive where we can but we are also fully conscious of our own national interests and of the views of other member states.  During the next phase of the discussions, Ireland will work constructively with the British Government and all our EU partners.  Our common goal remains the same, to find a consensual basis for the UK&rsquo;s continued membership of our Union.<br\/><br\/>Given the European Council's focus on the pressing migration issue, there was only a very brief consideration of the report by President Juncker and the heads of other institutions on completing the Economic and Monetary Union, EMU.  The completion of banking union is a vital part of the EMU process but, disappointingly from Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, there was no specific reference to this in the final conclusions.  On the report itself, several member states from outside the euro area were keen to have it spelled out that future EMU debate must take place in an open and transparent manner and in full respect of the Single Market.  We would sympathise with and support this approach which was reflected in the conclusions.  The European Council is to revert to the issue of EMU in December.  We very much favour a pragmatic and gradual approach which focuses in the first instance on steps that can be taken to more effectively implement existing instruments.  The Commission is expected to publish a first set of concrete proposals this week and it is expected that these will address reinforcing the economic governance framework, including an in-depth review of the six pack and two pack and reorganising the European semester, as well as on the external representation of the euro area at the IMF and other international organisations.  We look forward to examining these proposals in detail when they are published and as they are considered by Finance Ministers.<br\/><br\/>Many commentators have suggested that it will be our response to the massive waves of people who are now seeking refuge within our borders that defines what the Union will become in the years ahead.  I recall that the EU was born from adversity and has always managed to survive it.  While the solutions which are negotiated between 28 separate individual member states are often complex and while progress can be slow and difficult, I have great faith that with solidarity, responsibility and compassion, we will again manage to guide the Union to a prosperous and stable future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000029#BB01300","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445359800,"counter":325,"content":"<p>After years of unprecedented financial and economic crises, the European Union is today dealing with the largest humanitarian crisis it has ever faced.  However, its leaders continue to fail the basic test of responding with urgency, imagination and generosity.  This summit slightly nudged along a response but achieved little else.  With winter closing in and people about to be caught in desperate circumstances as border after border is being closed to them, what was needed was an agreement to do whatever it takes to help them.  This did not happen and therefore the summit has to be seen as a failure.  The fact that hundreds of thousands of people are risking everything to seek shelter in Europe shows that it is still seen as a place of hope and safety for many.<\/p><p>While the basic values of Europe are under attack in many places, they remain an inspiration for others.  The last thing we can do is allow the values of extremists to triumph.  We cannot allow them to make us fail in our obligation to do all that we can.<\/p> <p>  The Council President, Mr. Donald Tusk, has done good work in identifying the different elements which need to be addressed to provide a comprehensive response to the crisis.  Unfortunately, other leaders have been willing to identify the problems but unwilling to commit to the solutions.  There is a refugee crisis because millions of people are fleeing vicious conflicts.  They do not want to be refugees but want to live in their own homes.  The worst impact has come from the war in Syria, which was started by President Assad through his determination to hold power at all costs.  The early resistance to him was overwhelmingly from moderate communities, which have borne the brunt of his savage repression.  They offered talks, built coalitions of moderate forces and tried to find an end to the misery faced by the Syrian people.  In response, they experienced some of the most brutal actions ever undertaken by a state against its citizens.  The use of chemical weapons and the systematic clearing of cities caused millions to flee to neighbouring countries.  <\/p> <p> The Assad regime has been a client state of, first, the Soviet Union and now Russia for nearly half a century.  The efforts of some, both here and elsewhere, to claim the United States and Europe are responsible for the war are ridiculous and show again their double standards.  The emergence of the ISIS group has made the position worse.  It represents no one but the most fanatical religious hard-liners who are seeking to ethnically cleanse the entire region.  The systematic expulsion and murder of Christian communities and other religious minorities and the brutality shown towards non-Sunni Muslims are something most of us thought belonged to a different era. <\/p> <p> It says something very significant about both Assad and his Russian military backers that the majority of their effort is going into attacking the moderate opposition, rather than ISIS.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party strongly agrees with the basic position of the European Union that there can be no long-term peace with Assad in place.  There is too much blood on his hands and he has rejected too many opportunities to end the conflict for him to be a credible leader of a people which has never fully supported him.  No one has yet come up with a credible route forward, especially given Russia's ongoing veto threat against any United Nations resolution which could threaten Assad's position.  The first priority must be to continue the search for a way through this, achieve an agreed international position for a transition in Syria and create a united front against the barbarism of ISIS.  However, the most immediate concern must be the millions of people in camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.  Every person in these camps who is capable of leaving is rightly considering doing so.  They offer shelter but little else.  Even basic employment and education services are not available and medical facilities cover little more than the bare minimum. <\/p> <p> I welcome the call by the Council on member states to give more as it also recognises the problem.  The appalling budget deal means the European Union simply does not have the resources to step change its response.  It is, therefore, up to member states to do so.  We need an urgent commitment by states to give whatever it takes to bring facilities in the refugee camps up to basic standards and to do so before the full force of winter sets in.  The Government has spent the past week talking about how we have the opportunity to be generous.  Let us show generosity by taking the lead and immediately announcing a major increase in support for the Syrian refugee camps.<\/p> <p> For those who have decided to seek refuge in Europe, the immediate danger is now acute.  As we could all see from television reports yesterday, the weather is causing an acute crisis on the European Union's south-eastern borders.  There is no alternative to the core principle of solidarity and sharing responsibility between members.  Ireland must continue to reject the base populism of extremists and accept its shared role in helping the people concerned.  If there is no material improvement in the position in the next fortnight, Ireland should seek to have an emergency summit called.  There is no more time to waste.<\/p> <p> The summit's conclusions are vague on the deal being discussed with Turkey on seeking to prevent people from leaving camps in Turkey to travel to Europe.  As I stated, making conditions in the refugee camps bearable is an essential first step.  However, the idea that membership of the European Union, or at least access to core policies, should be bartered away in an emergency is not acceptable.  If leaders go too far, there will be an inevitable public backlash.<\/p> <p> Just as important is the issue of whether the European Union is agreeing to turn a blind eye to all actions by the Turkish Government in return for help.  As I stated previously, the position in Turkey is of great concern.  A drift away from essential democratic norms is evident in a number of important areas.  These include the pressure on independent media and a growing indifference to minority rights.  The Turkish Government appears to have been eager to escalate the conflict with the PKK and has pushed aside earlier, highly encouraging progress towards peaceful reconciliation.  Our sympathies should go out to all those affected by the bombing in Ankara, which was directed against a democratic peaceful movement dedicated to finding a place for the Kurdish people in Turkey.  Whatever is ultimately proposed as an agreement with Turkey, it must be based on humanitarian and democratic principles.<\/p> <p> A clear failure of the summit was its backing away from an essential component of the much needed banking union.  The lack of a shared regulation and resourcing of banks in the eurozone has been identified as one of the causes of the financial crisis which ultimately caused so much economic damage.  The creation of a banking union has been agreed as an absolute requirement of learning the lessons of the past and returning the eurozone to secure long-term growth.  Unfortunately, the Taoiseach and his colleagues have tried to muddle through with a policy which leaves in place key weaknesses.  To maintain confidence in the banking sector and its ability to lend to businesses and the community, a credible deposit guarantee mechanism is required.  In the context of the eurozone, the experiences of Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Cyprus have shown that the required confidence will only be established if guarantees extend beyond national economies.  This is one of the only ways of breaking the implied link between financial and sovereign debt.  The draft conclusions for last week's summit included a strong statement about a common deposit guarantee system.  In the face of inflexible resistance from Germany, however, this was removed and replaced with a banal statement about something being done at some point in future.  This is foolish in the extreme and undermines the very idea of a banking union. <\/p> <p> As a result of German resistance, we have a regulatory framework which does not extend to many systematically important banking sectors.  We have a recapitalisation fund which covers a tiny fraction of potential need and we now have a deposit insurance system which is basically the current failed model in new clothes.  We are nearing the end of the entire process of reform of economic and monetary union and the outcome is not encouraging.  There is no provision for fiscal transfers between states at times of need, no credible banking union and only a limited lender of last resort.  Not one of the identified weaknesses which led to the crisis has been addressed.  Instead, we have more talk about fiscal control as if this was the answer to everything.  Unfortunately,  Government policy has been solely driven by short-term domestic politics.  The Government has not set out a policy on the necessary reforms, has refused to ask for relief for debts incurred by Ireland as a result of what are now accepted to have been failures of European policies and has instead encouraged the view that Ireland was to blame for everything.  <\/p> <p> Statements on European Council meetings will probably not be held more than once or twice before the next general election.  It would be worthwhile for the Taoiseach to take time to examine the overblown rhetoric he used in previous contributions.  He should look at how often he spoke of everything being fine and described issues that are still in crisis as having been sorted.  He will see a Government that ignores what it said in its first years.  Let us not forget the billions of euro in retrospective recapitalisation the Taoiseach told us he would apply for before quietly abandoning that position without explanation.  Let us not forget his claim that Europe had been reformed and all was fine.  Let us not forget that instead of going to Europe with a clear agenda, time after time his only approach has been to wait to see what was agreed and then claim it as a great victory.<\/p><p>That is how he returned from one summit: claiming to have moved mountains to win a major interest rate reduction for Ireland when, in truth, he had asked for one quarter of what Greece secured and which was automatically extended to Ireland without discussion.  Time and again, other countries negotiated while the Taoiseach sat back with a public relations team ready to spin.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach's relationship with the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, has delivered nothing discernible for Ireland.  Their joint approach to Northern Ireland has been hands-off and, therefore, very damaging.  On Europe, it has meant meetings which were long on rhetoric and devoid of detail.  Five years after Mr. Cameron's announcement that he wanted an in-or-out referendum and two years after the renegotiation of British membership of the European Union was launched, we still have not heard from the British what they actually want.  We have not heard from our Government what we are willing to support.  It appears that the Prime Minister was finally forced last week to agree to say what he is looking for.  The first demand is for an opt-out from the concept of ever-closer union.  This is part of the treaties which has no specific legal effect and is of no concern.  The second demand is for an explicit statement that the union is a multi-currency union.  This is intended to separate the workings of the Union from those of the eurozone.  In practice, this could be very damaging.  The completion of a real fiscal and banking union requires a central entity to develop, enforce and administer policies.  This can only credibly be the institutions of the European Union.  What we urgently need in this regard is a proposal for the long-term governance of the eurozone, without which the British idea is risky at best.  The third demand is for a means to re-nationalise areas that have been subject to joint decisions within the Union.  If this is a Trojan horse for the Tory agenda of removing basic worker protections and other regulations implementing equality and safety policies, we should not accept it.  Finally, there is a general demand to protect the City of London and give it guaranteed access to all eurozone opportunities.  This is basically Britain saying that eurozone countries must bear all constraints of membership but share all the opportunities.  This is of particular concern for Ireland, as the return of certain euro markets to the eurozone is standard policy and one from which we might significantly benefit.<\/p> <p> Taken together, the list is a vague one that is more about English nationalist concerns than improving the European Union for other member states or even other parts of the United Kingdom.  Britain's remaining in the European Union is important for Ireland, but not at any price.  We need to know exactly what it is looking for and we need a debate on how far it is in our national interest and the interest of the European Union as a whole to make concessions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000030#CC00200","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445361000,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I endorse the Taoiseach's commendation of the Naval Service, most recently in respect of the crew of the <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>, who rescued 102 people on 15 October.  T&aacute; siad ag d&eacute;anamh s&aacute;robair.  T&aacute;imidne uilig agus t&aacute; muintir na h&Eacute;ireann f&iacute;orbhu&iacute;och agus f&iacute;orbhr&oacute;d&uacute;il as na mn&aacute; agus na fir ar an long seo.<\/p><p>Before the last European Council meeting, I raised the ongoing refugee crisis with the Taoiseach.  As his statement outlines, that dominated the Council meeting.  It is worth repeating that we are in exceptional times.  In the face of such a humanitarian crisis, our collective response must go above and beyond the bare minimum.  Hungary has now sealed its border with Croatia and thousands of refugees are stranded in inhuman and dangerous conditions, as Slovenia has limited the numbers it will allow in.  In human terms, this means that men, women and children who are literally fleeing for their lives are stuck in freezing and wet conditions as winter approaches.  The congress of the European People's Party, EPP, will take place on Wednesday and Thursday in Madrid.  I do not know if the Taoiseach is attending that cruinni&uacute;.  If so, will he discuss Hungary's criminalisation of refugees with Hungary's Prime Minister, who is a fellow member of the EPP group?  Will the Taoiseach condemn his atrocious comments that refugees are terrorists and that somehow Hungary is defending Christian or European ideals by criminalising refugees?  I am sure that, as a decent man, the Taoiseach does not subscribe to these baser instincts.<\/p><p>Slovenia and Croatia have both indicated that they will keep the present corridor open as long as Austria and Germany keep their doors open, but it is clear that EU states are incapable of formulating a common and humane position despite facing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War.  More than 615,000 people, most of them Syrians, have reached Europe so far this year, compared to just over 200,000 for the whole of 2014.  More than 475,000 people made it to Greece from Turkey in 2015.  Despite these figures, the EU has agreed to resettle only 160,000 refugees so far.  This is not good enough.  It is unacceptable, and EU Governments need to show greater leadership.  We have witnessed violent demonstrations by far-right elements and attacks on refugee centres in some EU states.  Over the weekend, a candidate for the mayoralty of Cologne, who works with refugees and has promoted policies which would assist them, was stabbed in the neck.  I have heard that she is in a serious but increasingly stable condition and has won the election.  I wish her a speedy recovery.  Additionally, an Afghan man trying to make his way into Bulgaria last week was shot by border guards and killed.  This must be the first time in a very long time that an EU border guard has shot and killed a refugee attempting to enter the EU.<\/p><p>Before the Council meeting, I asked the Taoiseach to argue for a humane and moral approach to the refugee crisis.  However, the conclusions of the meetings do not represent such a position.  The only agreement seems to be one to provide Turkey with &euro;3 billion in aid, ease visa restrictions for Turkish nationals, and offer a prospect of granting Turkey safe-country-of-origin status in return for that state's co-operation.  This completely ignores Turkey's deplorable human rights record, especially against Kurds, and Turkey's own role in the Syrian conflict.  Additionally, the EU's support for the Turkish Government is a political boost for the AK party ahead of the elections in Turkey on 1 November.  Peace rallies have been attacked by suicide bombers, most recently in Ankara, when 102 people lost their lives.  Our sympathy is with them and their families.  Some say the Turkish Government is deliberately failing to provide adequate protection for these rallies.  We must be mindful that many of the refugees fleeing Turkey are Kurds and that sending them back, as appears to be contemplated, could allow for major human rights violations.  The EU is offering a carrot to the Government of Turkey and a stick to refugees.  This is not a morally sustainable position.<\/p><p>Before the Council meeting, my colleague Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe raised with the Taoiseach the issues in Palestine and Israel.  I see nothing in the meeting's agreed conclusions to indicate that this was raised by the Taoiseach as requested by my colleague.  Did the Taoiseach raise that issue?  If not, why not?  If so, what was the consequence?  The death toll from political conflict in this region is rising and Israel is continuing to seal off neighbourhoods in occupied east Jerusalem.  While the Palestinian question may sometimes be submerged by the awfulness of other crises in the region, it remains a constant.  It is constant in terms of the suffering of the people involved and in terms of the destabilising effect that this unresolved issue between the people of Israel and the people of Palestine has on the wider region.  The Israeli Government is using violence against Arab residents while continuing military operations across the West Bank and Gaza.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000032#EE00200","speaker":"1066"}]
