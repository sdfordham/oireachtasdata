It could have responded narrowly to this judgment by setting a temporal limit.  Instead it decided to opt-in to the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive bringing Ireland into line with our EU partners and place the entire system on a legislative basis, which will be subject to EU oversight.  This is a significant and important reform, not only in addressing the issue of labour market access but also extending to children&rsquo;s rights, rights for unaccompanied minors, vulnerable people, new appeals processes, healthcare and education provision. <\/p>  <p>  During the course of the debate in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality, and in both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il, I outlined the proposal and rationale for opting into the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive under the terms of Protocol 21, annexed to the EU Treaties.  I also outlined the compliance process involved with the EU Commission which they require, and which will take four months to complete. <\/p>  <p>  Because of this timeframe, it was necessary to address the situation that will exist from 9 February until the opt-in process is completed.  During this interim period, those seeking international protection will have access to the labour market through the existing employment permit regime in the same manner as other Third County nationals.  In addition to accessing the employment permits regime, the Government decided to offer early certainty to those seeking self-employment from February 9 and prior to any confirmation of our opt-in.  In this regard, I used my executive power to provide an additional access for qualified applicants to engage in self-employment on terms that can be mirrored in a permanent scheme once the process of compliance with the Directive is completed with the EU Commission.  <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the interim arrangements, which removed the temporal limit of access to the workplace, is in keeping with the decision of the Supreme Court.  My colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has responsibility for the employment permits regime including the criteria, terms and applicable fees.  I understand that generally, any fees accompanying such access are usually paid by the employer.  <\/p>  <p>  I would stress that the interim scheme is designed to be of very short duration until the opt-in process is completed. Once this happens, access to the labour market will be underpinned by EU law.  I expect that this permanent scheme will provide for a broader access to the labour market for qualified applicants &ndash; the details of which will be worked out and announced in the coming months taking all factors into account. <\/p>  <p>  I am confident that this progressive approach by Government, which for the first time will see many elements of our protection process subject to EU law and verification by the EU Commission, will be a further major effective and reforming step as we seek to improve the standards of our reception conditions and determination of efficient protection applications. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600058#WRA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reform","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600058#WRA02200"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[5681\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600058#WRA02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the expected timeframe for the conclusion of the work to be carried out by the independent and change implementation group in respect of reform of his Department;

The Deputy will appreciate that the manner in which particular investigations are conducted is solely a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team and I have no role in relation to such investigations.  However,\u00a0I met with the Garda Commissioner and members of his team yesterday\u00a0and the response by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to organised crime was\u00a0one of\u00a0the issues discussed.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This shooting occurred within days of the brutal killing of Derek Hutch near Cloverhill Prison and the non-fatal shootings which took place outside the National Stadium on the South Circular Road on 26 January 2018.  I can assure the House that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also conducting comprehensive investigations into both these incidents and I wish them well with their enquiries.<\/p>  <p>  Let me be clear.  This type of criminal behaviour has no place in civilised society and will not be tolerated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or this Government.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have faced down this type of threat in the past and will do so again. <\/p>  <p>  I note that there has been some commentary recently to the effect that that the State provides less resources to policing organised crime north of the river Liffey.\u00a0 That assertion is ill-informed and unfounded. Garda operations in Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner-City have been underpinned by the increased resources made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by this Government.  In Budget 2018, for example,\u00a0approximately &euro;100 million was made available for Garda overtime to support ongoing Garda operations, such as Operation Hybrid.<\/p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; have made\u00a0significant progress in tackling the threat of organised crime, particularly in Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner-City. Operation Hybrid has been established to coordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and address public safety concerns about community safety, particularly in the North Inner City,\u00a0and benefits from significant support by Armed Support Units.  As of 21 January 2018 this response has included:<\/p>  <p>  -  72 arrests.<\/p>  <p>  -  13 charges in total (of which 10 charges related to murder investigations, 3 charges for related offences).<\/p>  <p>  -  34 firearms seized (in relation to murder offences).<\/p>  <p>  -  In the region of 260 searches.<\/p>  <p>  -  15,260 lines of enquiry conducted with more than 50,450 high visibility checkpoints implemented with significant support from Armed Support Units. <\/p>  <p>  -  A significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence has also been examined.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the conviction\u00a0last week in the Special Criminal Court of Eamonn Cumberton for the murder of Michael Barr in the Sunset House pub in April 2016, and the convictions of two other men, apprehended in possession of a large number of firearms, were feud related.  They came about as a result of concentrated efforts by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle the perpetrators involved in this ongoing feud.  We have also seen reports of a series of very significant drugs seizures by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as important seizures of significant banking information used to fuel the activities of organised criminals.  These seizures have significantly hampered the ability of these gangs to operate.<\/p>  <p>  The Government enacted new legislation to further target criminal activities including the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 which provides additional powers for Garda&iacute;; in particular, powers to allow for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to prevent them being disposed of.<\/p>  <p>  While the allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, the Minister for Justice and Equality is advised that since January 2017 a number of new Garda&iacute; have been assigned to Store Street, Bridewell and Mountjoy Garda Stations.  Furthermore, work is progressing towards the reopening of Fitzgibbon Street Garda station with funding for the project having been made available under the mid-term review of the Capital Plan 2015-2021. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There is also a dedicated Divisional Community Policing Office now based in Store Street for the North Central Division to ensure that the issues highlighted by the local community and stakeholders are dealt with expeditiously and effectively.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will not allow these criminals to prevail.  They will ensure that the perpetrators of these heinous crimes will be apprehended and brought to justice as quickly as possible and I can assure the Deputy that these endeavours will continue to be fully supported by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600058#WRA03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Constitutional Amendments","counter":32,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600058#WRA03100"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[1836\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600058#WRA03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will report on the constitutional referenda scheduled for 2018.","asker":"1253","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":34,"content":"<p>On 26 September 2017, the Government decided on an indicative timetable for a number of referenda to be held in 2018 and 2019.

The projected 4,000 civilians represents a medium-term target of 20% of the Garda full-time workforce comprised of civilians.  This target will be achieved through a twin-track approach of firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing roles where their skills\u00a0can be used to best effect\u00a0with the backfilling of these\u00a0roles\u00a0by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.\u00a0 The Garda Inspectorate identified some 1,500 posts held by Garda&iacute;\u00a0that could be examined for suitability for civilian staff.<\/p>  <p>  Progress is being made in relation to civilianisation.

The bulk were to address critical skills gaps and capacity\u00a0issues with a proportion sanctioned to make a start on the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing duties.\u00a0 Of particular significance is that\u00a0a number of civilians have been appointed to newly created senior leadership posts at Executive Director level to take responsibility for Strategy\u00a0and\u00a0Transformation\u00a0and Legal\u00a0and Compliance.\u00a0It is also\u00a0expected that a Chief Data Officer will be appointed shortly.

Such incidents cannot be tolerated in our society and this Government will continue to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling the gangs, including mobile criminal gangs, who target rural areas, including Co. Kildare.<\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and Districts and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  I can assure the Deputy that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that optimum use is made of these resources.  <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Kildare Division on 31 December 2017, the latest date for which figures are currently available, was 360 Garda&iacute; with 20 Garda Reserves and 30 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 80 have been assigned to the Kildare Division.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, very significant resources have been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including an overtime allocation of almost &euro;100 million announced in Budget 2018, to support large-scale policing operations including Operation Thor.  It is also worth noting that Operation Thor has now entered its &lsquo;Winter Phase&rsquo; which will run from 29 October 2017&ndash;1 April 2018.  Indeed, provisional operational material, released by the Garda&iacute; last month, indicates a significant drop in burglary rates for the 2 month period of November\/December 2017. This success has been attributed to the Winter Phase of Operation Thor.  Of course, these figures should be viewed with caution until such time as the publication of the official crime statistics has recommenced. <\/p><p>The scale of Garda activity against burglary and property-related crime under Operation Thor has led to concentrated Garda activity.  As of 18 January 2018, 105,790 targeted checkpoints and 99,210 crime prevention patrols have been conducted nationwide.  To give you an idea of the impact of the Operation, I can inform you that this concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 6,600 arrests and 7,420 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, include handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. <\/p><p>Operation Thor has targeted mobile criminal gangs engaged in burglary and related crimes and it is encouraging to note that since the launch of the operation in November 2015, the burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend.  The CSO official recorded crime statistics for 2016 show a decrease in burglary offences of 30% when compared to the previous twelve-month period in 2015.  This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor.<\/p><p>The Capital Plan 2016&ndash;2021 provides for an investment of &euro;46 million the Garda fleet.  This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013 to 2015.  Indeed, in the period 2013 to end of 2017 almost &euro;44 million will have been invested in the fleet with some 2,000 vehicles coming on stream in that period vehicles to ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>These additional investments in policing make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor.<\/p><p>This Government has also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.  This new legislation is now available to support the work which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities.  This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations.  These include the well established Community Alert Programme, which receives annual funding from my Department, as well as the work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme. <\/p><p>On 2 January 2018 I was pleased to announce that my Department will be providing an additional &euro;50,000 in financial support to Community Text Alert Groups as a further measure in this Government's support to crime prevention.  This is in addition to the &euro;100,000 which I announced at the National Ploughing Championships in September 2017 . The Rebate Scheme, which also ran in 2016, will allow Text Alert Groups registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply for funding to contribute towards their yearly running costs.  The Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and I would like to urge groups wishing to participate in the Scheme to contact Muintir na T&iacute;re for more information.  The website is www.muintir.ie.<\/p><p>Other policing initiatives include Theft Stop which was launched by the Garda&iacute; and the Irish Farmers Association.  Theft Stop is designed to deter criminals from taking and selling farm equipment by ensuring it is clearly marked with a unique ID (such as an EirCode) and then registered on a nationwide database. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country. <\/p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the\u00a0Garda\u00a0strength of the\u00a0Kildare Division on 31\u00a0December 2017, the latest date for which figures are currently available was 360,\u00a0an increase of 48 since 31 December 2015, with 20 Garda Reserves and\u00a030 Garda civilian staff\u00a0also attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. \u00a0To achieve this\u00a0the Government\u00a0has put\u00a0in place a plan for\u00a0an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom\u00a080 have been assigned to the\u00a0Kildare Division.\u00a0 I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - an increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to\u00a0maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce\u00a0to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. \u00a0This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. \u00a0Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements,\u00a0reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation or other more fixed group would have.\u00a0 Relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid with shifting memberships,\u00a0 alliances and a membership which may depend on circumstance.<\/p><p>However, criminal legislation has been updated in recent years, with a view to\u00a0 ensuring that it provides a comprehensive range of provisions for the prosecution and punishment of crime, in particular the activities of those involved in organised crime.<\/p><p>Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.\u00a0 These offences include participation in a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation.\u00a0 The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.\u00a0 On conviction, this offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment.  <\/p><p>The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such act actually takes place or not.<\/p><p>Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were introduced aiding prosecution for the offences under the Act.<\/p><p>Provision was also introduced so that where a serious offence is committed as part of or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600059#WRB05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Policy","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600059#WRB05200"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[5297\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600059#WRB05300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the action he is taking to address the inadequacies and loopholes which exist in legislation governing the immigration system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1300","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[5298\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600059#WRB05400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to prepare and issue a White Paper to provide an overview of the entirety of the immigration laws and to identify the way in which the immigration system can be improved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1300","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 87 together.<\/p><p>By any standard Ireland operates an open immigration policy which often requires a flexible approach to respond to various requirements and needs. <\/p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to work with the relevant Oireachtas Committees to introduce a comprehensive Immigration and Residency Reform Bill.

We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom\u00a058 have been assigned to the\u00a0Wexford\u00a0Division.\u00a0 I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p>  <p>  I am also pleased that funding is in place to\u00a0maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce\u00a0to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.\u00a0 This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. \u00a0Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements,\u00a0reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the\u00a0Wexford\u00a0Division. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600060#WRC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Policy","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600060#WRC03500"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[5694\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600060#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if persons applying for naturalisation that are not decided upon within the six-month guideline will be provided with a detailed explanation as to the reasons for the delay including the provision to the person of additional information required to process the application in a timely manner.","asker":"1238","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":144,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.\u00a0 All applications are examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory conditions for naturalisation\u00a0set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, such as good character and lawful residence.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.

An increase of &euro;1,000 from 1 April 2017, on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000 per annum was paid on 19 July 2017.

The first point on the payscale for a Sergeant, including Military Service Allowance, is just under &euro;40,000 per annum. A  newly qualified non-graduate entry 2nd Lieutenant can expect a minimum of &euro;35,000 per annum after 15 months of training, while a graduate entry Lieutenant can expect a minimum of &euro;39,860 per annum after 15 months of training.<\/p><p>In addition to this, as a result of successful negotiations with PDFORRA, the pay of general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, was increased further.

Ireland was represented by Minister of State McEntee.  I welcome the adoption of these negotiating Directives.  From the start of the EU-UK negotiations Ireland has been to fore in arguing for effective transitional arrangements that ensure an orderly UK withdrawal from the Union, minimises disruption for citizens and businesses and leads to an ambitious and comprehensive future relationship agreement.  Through the various preparatory bodies and at the GAC (Art 50) we were active in working with our EU27 partners and the European Commission to shape the negotiating Directives.  The Directives were in turn based on the European Council Guidelines agreed with the Taoiseach and his fellow Heads of State and Government at the European Council on 15 December last. <\/p><p>I welcome that the EU is proposing a status quo transitional arrangement after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. Such an arrangement will provide certainty and limit disruption for our citizens and businesses.  Under such an arrangement the UK will be expected to continue to apply the full EU acquis.<\/p><p>As concerns the duration of such a transition, the Government agrees that in the interests of long term certainty, and to accelerate agreement on the future relationship agreement, it must be time bound . This is the overall view of both the EU and of the UK.  Therefore a date of 31 December 2020 has been set for the end of the transition period. But equally, as the negotiations progress, the overriding objective on both sides must be to avoid any gaps and any cliff edge effects. It is therefore welcome that the General Affairs Council agreed to keep the Directives in all their aspects under constant review, taking account of developments in the Brexit negotiations.<i><\/i>This provides the flexibility required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600061#WRD05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600062#WRE00300"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[5835\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600062#WRE00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of secondees from companies (details supplied) that are working in his Department.","asker":"1259","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":213,"content":"<p>There are no secondees from the companies named in the Deputy&rsquo;s question working in my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600062#WRE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Peace Process","counter":214,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600062#WRE00600"},{"type":"question","counter":215,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[5935\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600062#WRE00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the degree to which Ireland and the EU continue to maintain a positive influence in the Israeli Palestine peace process with particular reference to President Trump's administration growing partiality in the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":216,"content":"<p>Ireland, along with our EU partners, supports the achievement of a two state solution to the Middle East conflict.

The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated any differently to any other driver subject to their ability to demonstrate, and the insurance company to verify, their continued driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company. What this means is that the returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending that time abroad.\u00a0 Furthermore, under the protocol insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, insurance companies have agreed to provide relevant and helpful information on their websites to make it easier for consumers to understand the implications of their move abroad from a motor insurance perspective.

In addition, EU directives require that\u00a0financial institutions\u00a0ascertain the identities of their customer in order to\u00a0prevent the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing.<\/p>  <p>  Section 33 of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, as amended, sets out the requirements in relation to customer due diligence ('CDD').\u00a0 Pursuant to section 33, designated persons are required to identify the customer and verify the customer's identity\u00a0on the basis of documents (whether or not in electronic form) or information, that the designated person has reasonable grounds to believe can be relied upon to confirm the identity of the customer.\u00a0 The Central Bank does not prescribe what documents or information designated persons should obtain from a customer in order to satisfy the requirements of section 33.\u00a0 This is a matter for each designated person to determine.<\/p>  <p>  General Principle 2.11 of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the CPC) provides that\u00a0'[a] regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customers and within the context of its authorisation it: without prejudice to the pursuit of its legitimate commercial aims, does not, through its policies, procedures, or working practices, prevent access to basic financial services'.<\/p>  <p>  Guidelines on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing are available on my\u00a0Department's website at\u00a0http:\/\/www.finance.gov.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Criminaljustice2012.pdf\u00a0. Appendix 2 of these guidelines is a non-exhaustive and non-mandatory list of alternative documents that can be used to verify identity in circumstances where a prospective customer cannot, for justifiable reasons, meet the standard identification and verification requirements, or has experienced difficulties in the past when seeking to open accounts.  If an individual has difficulty with a bank, I would advise them to examine this list to see how they can meet identification requirements and then approach the financial institution again.<\/p>  <p>  If the consumer is not satisfied with the financial service provider&rsquo;s decision(s) to refuse the provision of services (including a refusal to provide a bank account or a mortgage), they can make a complaint, using the bank&rsquo;s internal formal complaints procedure.\u00a0 If the consumer is not satisfied with the outcome of the complaint, they may wish to refer the matter to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman to have it independently investigated. \u00a0Contact details are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, 3rd Floor, Lincoln House, Lincoln Place, Dublin 2 Locall:\u00a0 1890 88 20 90; Email:\u00a0 info@fspo.ie;\u00a0 Website:\u00a0www.fspo.ie\u00a0.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding mortgages, there are a number of statutory and regulatory provisions in place governing the provision of such loans to consumer borrowers.\u00a0 These include the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code and the Central Bank macro-prudential rules for residential mortgage lending.\u00a0 When taken together these require lenders to, inter alia, carry out a credit worthiness assessment (and for that purpose lenders will be required to gather relevant information about a borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation such as information on the borrower&rsquo;s income, expenses, assets, debts, employment status, known future change in circumstances etc.), and to offer mortgage credit only where the results of the assessment indicates that the borrower is likely to be in a position to meet the terms of the proposed credit agreement.\u00a0 In addition, subject to a limited discretion available to lenders, the maximum amount of residential mortgage credit lenders will be in a position to provide in any individual case will have a regard to the value of the residential property which will act as security for the loan and the income of the borrower(s).\u00a0 Other than the requirements which apply to the provision of residential mortgage credit generally, it should be noted that there are no Central Bank regulatory provisions which specifically prevent or restrict the ability of a lender to provide mortgage credit to recently returned residents.\u00a0 However, it should also be noted that, subject to complying with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements, it remains a commercial matter for each lender to determine its overall lending policies and to make its own underwriting decisions on individual loan applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600062#WRE04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Bank of Ireland","counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600062#WRE04800"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[5719\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600062#WRE04900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Central Bank has received a copy of the Financial Conduct Authority's report into the actions of an organisation (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":254,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that it has an ongoing engagement with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on a range of issues.

Sufficient demand emerged in 28 areas, and consultations followed with the main Catholic patrons in each of these areas to discuss divesting options.  <\/p>  <p>  In the majority of the 28 areas surveyed, the level of parental demand for a wider choice indicated a long-term projected size of up to half a single stream school (comprising of 4 classrooms) being required to accommodate such a level of demand and this is clearly outlined in the Reports on the Surveys regarding Parental Preferences on Primary School Patronage published by the Department in December 2012 and April 2013.  Based on the current pupil teacher ratio of 26:1, half a single stream equates to a junior infant intake of 13 pupils.<\/p>  <p>  The schools under the patronage divesting process are opened in areas of relatively stable populations and accordingly there is little prospect that new schools will be established there over the next number of years for demographic reasons.  Therefore, the only mechanism for alternative patrons to become involved in school provision in these areas was through the possible divestment of some existing school provision in the areas provided there was sufficient parental demand for wider choice of patronage.<\/p>  <p>  A number of schools opened under this process, including Tramore ETNS, New Ross ETNS, Trim ETNS, Tuam ETNS and Castlebar ETNS were contacted by the Department in the context of their enrolment numbers reflecting their school accommodation capacity. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of any school applying to expand its intake, the Department examines school size in order to preserve a balance among all schools in an area and to ensure that one school is not expanding at the expense of another.  In addition, schools which are located in temporary accommodation may need to restrict their intake in line with the temporary accommodation available.  While the situation may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice, the Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that the existing schools in the area can, between them, cater for the demand in that area. The Department&rsquo;s principal priority in the allocation of scarce capital funding has to be in providing sufficient school places in areas of demographic growth. <\/p>  <p>  Should a school&rsquo;s patron wish to make a case for an increase in the school&rsquo;s intake level, a proposal can be submitted to the Department where it will be reviewed in conjunction with the current demographic data, available accommodation and capacity levels of all schools in the relevant area.  A case has been submitted to the Department in respect of a number of divested schools and this is currently under consideration.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently carrying out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to identify areas of demographic growth and determine where additional school accommodation is needed in order to plan for school provision.  It is anticipated that these exercises will be completed in the coming weeks.  In this context, the outcome of these nationwide demographic exercises will input into consideration of the case submitted in relation to the schools opened under the patronage divesting process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600064#WRG05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation Provision","counter":377,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600065#WRH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":378,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[5440\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600065#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress on the plans for development at a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":379,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department received an application for the provision of additional accommodation at the school referred to, which includes the provision of general classroom and special needs accommodation.<\/p><p>My Department met with the ETB involved and the scope of works relating to the project is currently being finalised.\u00a0 My Department will be in further contact with the ETB in the matter shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600065#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600065#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[5442\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600065#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if approval will be given to an application for a special needs assistant for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1279","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":382,"content":"<p>Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are provided to assist recognised schools to cater for pupils with disabilities, who have additional and significant care needs, in an educational context and where the nature of these care needs have been outlined in medical and other professional reports as being so significant that a pupil will require additional adult assistance in order to be able to attend school and to participate in education.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which is an independent statutory agency, is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school.<\/p><p>The NCSE allocates SNA support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in Department Circular 0030\/2014, which is available on the Department's website at <i>www.education.ie,<\/i>in order that students who have care needs can access SNA support as and when it is needed.\u00a0 The Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support.<\/p><p>In considering applications for SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources.

It gives students better learning opportunities, and rewards and recognises non-academic performance and achievements, with a central focus on the student&rsquo;s quality of life, wellbeing and mental health.  The new junior cycle has been developed on a partnership approach, involving teachers, their unions and many wider interests over a considerable period of time.  The new approach draws on the best available international research evidence in order to ensure the best possible learning experience for students at this vital stage of their development.<\/p>  <p>  The written exam for English has been reduced from a 5 hour exam to a 2 hour exam.  This reflects the move to a dual approach to assessment.  The Classroom Based Assessments have been introduced to allow students to show their understanding of skills and concepts that would not be possible in an externally assessed examination.  This dual approach reduces the focus on one terminal examination and increases the prominence given to classroom-based assessment.

I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers.  The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of the changes I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511, at a cost of over &euro;200 million across the public service.<\/p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010. It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.

The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.<\/p><p>These provisions must have regard to the right to a fair trial, including the provision of legal aid where appropriate, which is a Constitutional right upheld by the courts in a number of judgments.  The Supreme Court ruling in the case of <i>State (Healy) v Donoghue [1976]I.R. 325<\/i>effectively determined that the right to criminal legal aid is, in circumstances which are quite wide in practice, a Constitutional right.  Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights states that &quot;<i>Everyone charged with a criminal offence has [the right] to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require&quot;. <\/i>As the Deputy will be aware, an accused person is entitled to a presumption of innocence and legal representation and any obstacles to obtaining necessary legal aid which were found to be unreasonable could give a defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.<\/p><p>My Department is preparing a draft General Scheme of a Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Bill, the key purpose of which is to transfer the administration of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme to the Legal Aid Board and to give effect to <\/p><p>Government Programme commitments in respect of criminal legal aid, including introducing a more rigorous and objective means testing system for criminal legal aid, provision for contributions, and new sanctions.

It is intended that it will make a significant difference over its lifetime to the position of people with disabilities in Irish society.<\/p><p>The Strategy contains eight themes as follows:<\/p><p>- Equality and Choice<\/p><p>- Joined up policies and public services<\/p><p>- Education<\/p><p>- Employment<\/p><p>- Health and Wellbeing<\/p><p>- Person centred disability services<\/p><p>- Living in the Community; and<\/p><p>- Transport and Accessible Places <\/p><p>Underpinning these themes are a set of high level objectives, and 114 measurable and time-specific actions that relate to the areas of education, employment, provision of public services, health, transport, and personal safety and autonomy.  The key commitments to action it contains may be summarised as follows:<\/p><p>- Extension of Irish Sign Language remote interpretation service.<\/p><p>- Resourcing of the Sign Language Interpreting Service (SLIS) to increase the number of trained Sign Language and Deaf Interpreters, to put a quality-assurance and registration scheme in place and to provide on-going professional training and development for Interpreters.<\/p><p>- Legislation that will ensure that all public bodies provide Irish Sign Language users with free interpretation when accessing or availing of statutory services.<\/p><p>- Examination of the recommendations of the Make Work Pay Working Group with a view to introducing meaningful reforms.<\/p><p>- Full implementation of the Comprehensive Employment Strategy.<\/p><p>- A review of transport supports to determine the type of cross-departmental transportation options that will best help people with a range of disabilities to get to work, and implementation of the most viable proposals.<\/p><p>- Development of proposals to address access to, or affordability of, necessary aids\/appliances\/assistive technology required for everyday living, for those people with disabilities whose entry, retention or return to work could be jeopardised due to being unable to afford these items.<\/p><p>- Introduction of a scheme that will significantly reduce the notice time for travelling for mobility-impaired customers requiring assistance.<\/p><p>- Development of proposals in relation to attaching conditions regarding wheelchair accessibility on passenger coach and train licensed services.<\/p><p>- Examination of the recommendations of the report of the Personalised Budgeting Taskforce, with a view to introducing individualised funding\/personal budget.<\/p><p>- Development of Codes of Practice to support implementation of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2016.<\/p><p>- Full implementation of the Access and Inclusion model of supports for children with disabilities to allow every child participate meaningfully in Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme <\/p><p>- Full implementation of the Transforming Lives programme.<\/p><p>The Strategy is a &lsquo;living document,&rsquo; with consultation on a mid-term review to take place towards the end of this year, and revised iterations of the Strategy being published periodically, containing update and more ambitious actions in the light of progress to date. <\/p><p>The Strategy is a cross-government approach that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies including:<\/p><p>- Department of Justice and Equality<\/p><p>- Department of Education and Skills<\/p><p>- Department of Health<\/p><p>- Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection<\/p><p>- Health Service Executive<\/p><p>- National Disability Authority<\/p><p>- Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government<\/p><p>- Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport<\/p><p>- National Transport Authority<\/p><p>- Department of Public Expenditure and Reform<\/p><p>The focus in implementing the Strategy is on continuing interdepartmental cooperation and a joined-up approach, which is overseen by the Steering Group.  Implementation is being supported by independent analysis and advice from the NDA, and also by periodic review and oversight by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy as appropriate.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Given the significant number of actions contained in the Strategy, I do not propose to provide updates on each.  However at the most recent meeting of the Steering Group, which I chair, on 8 December 2017, I was advised as follows in relation to the 109 actions due to start, be progressed, or be completed in 2017:<\/p><p>- Some 64 actions were recorded as being on track.<\/p><p>- Minor delivery issues, including incomplete reporting were recorded against 22 actions.<\/p><p>- Significant delivery issues were reported against nine actions.<\/p><p>- Six actions were recorded as being completed.<\/p><p>- Status information was due to be received on a further eight actions<\/p><p>While I am broadly satisfied with the progress made so far, it is imperative that the Steering Group continues to focus on analysing the actions which recorded significant delivery issues, and gaining an understanding of why these initiatives been delayed, and accurately identifying the barriers and removing them. <\/p><p>While implementation is of course a critical stage of the process, it is also essential that we measure the overall impact of the Strategy itself, and determine whether the lives the lives of people with disabilities have improved as a result of the implementation of the actions contained in the strategy. Accordingly, it is essential that a suite of indicators is developed that will enable measurement of change in key areas addressed by the Strategy.\u00a0 This critical piece of work is being advanced by the National Disability Authority, and the Group will sign off on agreed indicators at our next meeting on 13 April. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600068#WRL00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Statistics","counter":535,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600068#WRL00900"},{"type":"question","counter":536,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[5486\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600068#WRL01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the recommendations that have been implemented further to the report of the make work pay group published in April 2017; the recommendations that have yet to be implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1330","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":537,"content":"<p>The Make Work Pay report was published on 6 April 2017, following the deliberations of an interdepartmental group established under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities.

Multi-disciplinary approaches are also utilised to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted, including through the use of the proceeds of crimes legislation, money-laundering legislation, the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 relating to organised crime and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau. <\/p><p>Given the fluid nature of such groupings it is extremely difficult to quantify the number of criminal groups operating at a particular time.

Relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid with shifting memberships, alliances and a membership which may depend on circumstance.  <\/p><p>However, criminal legislation has been updated in recent years, with a view to  ensuring that it provides a comprehensive range of provisions for the prosecution and punishment of crime, in particular the activities of those involved in organised crime.<\/p><p>Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.

In relation to persons granted refugee status, under the International Protection Act 2015 they are given permission to reside in the State for a period of three years and are eligible to apply for citizenship after 3 years.  All those with refugee status are granted a Stamp 4 immigration permission which includes full access to the labour market and State services. <\/p>  <p>  At the end of January 2018 there was a total of 248 persons pending in the protection system for more than seven years at either first or appeal stage, including failed asylum seekers awaiting a consideration of an intention to deport or a grant of leave to remain.  To put this figure in context, nearly 22,000 persons have applied for asylum over the past 10 years.  These cases tend to be complex in nature and are often the subject of multiple appeals including judicial reviews.  There can also be complex family situations where one family member may be preventing the finalising of the applications for the entire family. <\/p>  <p>  Figures of asylum applications that are over 10 years old and yet to reach a final determination are not readily available and it would require staff resources to be diverted from processing of cases which must take priority.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the\u00a0Garda\u00a0strength of the\u00a0Kildare Division on 31\u00a0December 2017 was 360,\u00a0an increase of 48 since 31 December 2015, with 20 Garda Reserves and\u00a030 Garda civilian staff\u00a0also attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.<\/p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years in addition to the 2,800 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom\u00a080 have been assigned to the\u00a0Kildare Division.  I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net\u00a0increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to\u00a0maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce\u00a0to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College.  Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements,\u00a0reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>As the strength of the sworn members increases to 15,000 it will be important to ensure that there appropriate levels of support and supervision are maintained.

There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.

The Review Group was assembled to review all training in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and included leading members of public and private sector organisations.  It was tasked with recommending ways to improve and reinvigorate Garda training to align to best practice and meet the new challenges of a changing society.<\/p>  <p>  The Review Group conducted best practice site visits at nine international police training facilities.  During these site visits particular attention was given to the training and development of new entrants.  The various models of foundation police training observed internationally were considered in the analysis of the previous training programme, the B.A in Police Studies.  The analysis identified areas for development of that programme and also established methods of enhancing the preparation of Student\/Probationer Garda&iacute; for core operational Garda duties.  It was recommended that the development of a new training programme for student\/probationers be structured over three phases of training.  This modularised programme aims to address core policing skills through blended learning, increased use of scenario-based practical training and drawing on problem based learning (PBL) methodologies.  The current foundation training programme was developed and was first delivered to new entrants in September 2014.  This new training programme is known as the B.A in Applied Policing programme.  It is accredited by the University of Limerick, which oversees the delivery and quality assurance of the training programme in line with the requirements of Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  I am informed that\u00a0on four occasions each year a Board of Examiners meeting is convened by the University of Limerick to review and ratify results for the B.A in Applied Policing Programme.  At these Board of Examiners meeting, the University of Limerick tasks external examiners, who have international police expertise, to review and make recommendations regarding best practice in relation to the B.A in Applied Policing programme.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of leadership and management, the Leadership Management &amp;amp; Professional Development (LMPD) Training Section attached to the Garda College is responsible for developing, delivering and facilitating the leadership and development training for newly promoted personnel.  All programmes delivered underpin the philosophies of the Training Review Report 2009 to achieve a commitment to lifelong learning within the organisation.  To ensure up to date development, substantial elements of the programmes which specifically deal with supervision, leadership and management are put out to tender to ensure the organisation gets the best available and up to date external training in this field.  I am advised that all Garda personnel who deliver the LMPD programme have level 9 NFQ qualifications in the area of leadership, organisation behaviour, executive coaching, and level 8 NFQ in leadership and governance.  They are also professionally qualified at international level in the area of emotional intelligence and psychometrics, and hold practitioner&rsquo;s qualifications in &ldquo;Leadership GRID&rdquo;, an international leadership development programme.  In line with Garda Inspectorate reports, LMPD has incorporated coaching and mentoring in all programmes and has external executive coaches as part of senior management development and 360 feedbacks.<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised that each year members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na attend international training programmes under the auspices of CEPOL, the European Agency for Law Enforcement Training.  These programmes take place in EU Member States and include a broad range of policing related programmes.<\/p>  <p>  To support continuous professional development each Garda Division has a Continuous Professional Development School, which provides training on a variety of topics and issues ranging from procedural to legislative changes and the implementation of new initiatives.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner's\u00a0Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 which is under way recognises that it is critical that all personnel are kept up to date on relevant policies and changes in the law and that continuous professional development must be a constant within An Garda\u00a0S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I have been informed by the Commissioner that, as part of\u00a0this programme, investment in learning and development in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be enhanced so that all personnel will receive the training, mentoring and leadership development that they require to continue to develop their skills\u00a0so that they can perform more effectively in their roles and progress their careers.<\/p>  <p>  There is, of course, always benefit in taking stock to see whether things can be done better or in a different way.  The Commission on the Future of Policing is examining all aspects of policing in the State including training.  I understand that Commission members have met with those in the University of Limerick and have also visited the Garda College as part of their work.  The Commission is due to report in September 2018 and I look forward to its recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600070#WRN02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Equipment","counter":645,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600070#WRN02200"},{"type":"question","counter":646,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[6029\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600070#WRN02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which adequate provision continues to be made to ensure the availability of the most sophisticated technology to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the course of duties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":647,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, decisions in relation to the provision and allocation of Garda equipment and resources, including ICT, are a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that Garda&iacute; must have the modern technology and resources necessary to detect and investigate crimes, and to prevent loss and harm to citizens and their property on a 24\/7 basis.

The Lisbon Treaty extended this competence to cover foreign direct investment, as well as making the European Parliament a co-legislator alongside the Council on trade matters.  The European Commission acts as lead negotiator on behalf of all EU countries regarding trade agreements with non-EU countries.  Member States (in Council) approve negotiating directives (or mandates) before negotiations begin, are kept informed of developments as the negotiations proceed and have final approval at Council.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission sought the opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in relation to the competence of the European Union to sign and conclude the EU Singapore Free Trade Agreement.  The CJEU&rsquo;s Opinion issued on the 16th of May 2017, and found that the Free Trade Agreement between the EU and the Republic of Singapore (EUSFTA) cannot be signed and concluded by the EU alone: it has to be signed and concluded both by the EU and by each of its Member States, i.e. that it is a &lsquo;Mixed Agreement&rsquo;.  The Opinion found that some aspects the agreement fall within the EU&rsquo;s exclusive competence while other aspects will require additional approval from national and regional legislatures.

The competences shared between the EU and the Member States are provisions on investment protection in so far as they relate to non-direct foreign investment (i.e., portfolio investments); and provisions on Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS).

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of transport to adults with a disability attending HSE-funded day services is not a core health service, and the HSE endeavours to ensure that all service users access public transport, including rural transport services, if possible.  This is in keeping with the principle of mainstreaming with a clear focus on ensuring persons with a disability have access to the normal range of services and participate in community life as far as possible.  In general, day service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the Free Travel Pass.<\/p>  <p>  However when all other options are exhausted, and a person cannot avail of a day service because they do not have transport to attend, some transport is provided by disability service providers on a case by case basis as resources allow.  Service providers are continuously reviewing their transport arrangements to ensure that they are used as effectively and equitably as possible within available resources.  This may result in the provision of a reduced quantum of service to the service user, and the HSE does its best to provide transport in certain cases without reducing services.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE intends to liaise with the National Transport Authority and disability service providers to explore ways in which the Authority&rsquo;s services could assist people with disabilities.  The National Transport Authority has a total of 17 Transport co-ordinating units called Local Link which provide safe secure and reliable Public Transport services in local and rural areas of Ireland through a combination of scheduled Public Transport services and door to door services.

As Minister for Health, I want to ensure that both the current use of mesh implants in uro-gynaecological procedures in Ireland, and the on-going clinical management of women who have had these procedures in the past, are in line with international best practice and emerging evidence.  At my request, the Chief Medical Officer is preparing a report on the many clinical and technical issues involved, including the issues raised at Leader&rsquo;s Questions and in previous Parliamentary Questions on this topic.  I am informed that this work involves engagement with national and international bodies, the professional colleges and others.  This work is underway and will take a number of months to complete and I would ask the Deputy to await the outcome of that work.<\/p><p>I would have no objection to meeting with women affected and their representatives once this report to me is completed.<\/p><p>The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) advises that they are not aware of scientific evidence which concludes these devices are unsafe when used in line with their intended use.  The HPRA continues to liaise closely with European Competent Authorities, the European Commission and with International regulatory agencies in relation to the international evidence relating to these devices.  No regulatory action has been taken to date by Competent Authorities in any European country in respect of these devices.<\/p><p>The  HPRA has also consulted with a number of clinical experts in this field.  The advice of Dr. Suzanne O&rsquo;Sullivan, President Continence Foundation of Ireland (www.continence.ie) and Consultant Obstetrician and Urogynaecologist in Cork University Maternity Hospital is that &ldquo;The MUS [mid-urethral sling] has become the operation of choice in Europe, Asia, North and South America and Australasia for treatment of stress urinary incontinence with several million procedures performed worldwide.  Whilst each patient differs in terms of symptoms, background medical history, optimal treatment approaches may differ.  Relative to other procedures mid urethral slings have been shown, in large studies from all over the world, to be no less safe (and usually more safe) than other procedures and with improved short, medium and longterm outcomes.  These mesh slings have major advantages of shorter operating and admission times, and a quicker return to normal activities together with lower rates of complications&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The safety of surgical meshes used in urogynecological surgery has also been reviewed in Europe by the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).  SCENIHR was requested to provide a scientific Opinion on the safety of surgical meshes used in contemporary pelvic surgery.  The Opinion of the SCENIHR was approved in December 2015 and is available, together with a summary of the outcome, on the website of the European Commission .<\/p><p>The SCENIHR summary outlines that &lsquo;clinical outcome following mesh implantation is influenced by material properties, product design, overall mesh size, route of implantation, patient characteristics, associated procedures (e.g. hysterectomy) and the surgeon&rsquo;s experience&rsquo;.<\/p><p>SCENIHR states that &lsquo;synthetic sling SUI surgery is an accepted procedure with proven efficacy and safety in the majority of patients with moderate to severe SUI, when used by an experienced and appropriately trained surgeon.  Therefore, the SCENIHR supports continuing synthetic sling use for SUI, but emphasises the importance of appropriately trained surgeons and detailed counselling of patients about the associated risk\/benefits&rsquo;.  SCENIHR also highlights that &ldquo;the implantation of any mesh for the treatment of POP via the vaginal route should only be considered in complex cases, in particular, after failed primary repair surgery&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The Department strongly advises that any woman who experiences or suspects that she has experienced a complication associated with TVMI surgery should discuss this with her GP or with the hospital from which she received the implant.

The Programme for Government commits to shifting the model of Irish healthcare towards a more comprehensive and accessible service that can deliver better patient care closer to home in communities across the country.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare supported a shift to primary and community-based care. <\/p>  <p>  General Practitioners play an important role in the primary care system.  There is a clear need to modernise the GMS contract and ensure that general practice is a viable and rewarding career for medical graduates.  My aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions.  A new contract must be flexible and be able to respond to the changing nature of the GP workforce. It must also include provisions in relation to service quality and standards, performance, accountability and transparency.  This will be key in making general practice a more attractive career.  I am confident that with the continued constructive engagement of the parties involved, progress on these important issues can be made in the period ahead. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to the continued development of GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future. I want to ensure that existing GP services are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly qualified GPs.  <\/p>  <p>  Efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible\/shared GMS\/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of enhanced supports for rural GP practices.  These steps should help to address the future demand for GPs by enticing GPs who may have ceased practicing for family or other reasons back into the workforce, facilitating GPs to work past the standard retirement age and encouraging more GPs to work in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the State is seeking to train more GPs to provide GP services to the population.  In 2009, there were 120 GP training places and in 2018 there are 198 places available, an increase of 65% over this nine-year period.  The Government is committed to further increasing this number to 259 places annually in future years. <\/p>  <p>  As with other health professionals, GPs were subject to fee reductions under FEMPI.  In the context of the publication by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, of the Public Service Pay and Pension Bill 2017, on 7 November 2017, I announced that in 2018 I will undertake a process of engagement with representative bodies of contracted health professionals, aimed at putting in place a new multi-annual approach to fees, in return for service improvement and contractual reform and in line with Government priorities for the health service.  I am currently considering, along with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the most appropriate approach in this regard.

The review also noted that current quality assurance governance arrangements between BowelScreen and its provider units are appropriate.<\/p><p>The HSE advise that patients received open disclosure at the time of diagnosis and that open communication was maintained thereafter.  Patients and their families were made aware of the commissioning of the External Review and were notified of the findings of the review in advance of its publication.<\/p><p>The outcome of this review, and the earlier SIMT report, is that more robust procedures are now in place for the benefit of  patients.  To date BowelScreen has:<\/p><p>- Implemented a new policy to manage safety incidents, so that serious issues are managed in a standardised and appropriate manner;<\/p><p>- Developed enhanced policies and procedures to strengthen early warning systems and to ensure that a proactive response is taken;<\/p><p>- Revised the relevant agreements with hospital partners to include all relevant quality assurance guidelines; <\/p><p>- Augmented and clarified the requirement for detailed clinical audit at local level;<\/p><p>- Increased the minimum Adenoma Detection Rate (this is the standard measurement of clinical quality in endoscopy) from 25% to 45% and commenced measurement at individual clinician level;<\/p><p>- Completed the revision of Programme Quality Assurance Guidelines; and<\/p><p>- Put in place arrangements to commence reporting on interval cancers once the data is available.<\/p><p>Meanwhile, the HSE launched its revised Incident Management Framework on 24th January 2018.  The Framework incorporates guidance on making decisions about appropriate pathways for investigation and review, including in situations where staff may have concerns in relation to the performance of a colleague.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600074#WRR05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treatment Purchase Fund Eligibility","counter":885,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600075#WRS00600"},{"type":"question","counter":886,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[5523\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600075#WRS00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a person (details supplied) will be considered for treatment under the National Treatment Purchase Fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":887,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017.<\/p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles.<\/p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN.<\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster for three months.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.<\/p><p>These patients were identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and continued to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017.  However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives.<\/p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications.  GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system.  The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.<\/p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. <\/p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. <\/p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. <\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster for three months.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.<\/p><p>These patients were identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and continued to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017.  However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. <\/p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications.  GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system.  The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.<\/p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.

The aim behind LCR was to ensure sufficient balance in the market overall between older people and younger people, between those who tend to claim more and those who tend to claim less, and thereby ensure the sustainability of the community rated approach.   LCR encourages more young people to take out health insurance as a way to avoid late entry loadings of 2% per annum which may apply at age 35 and older.  <\/p>  <p>  While approximately 45% of Irish people hold private health insurance, everyone &ndash; with or without insurance - is entitled to access healthcare via the public health system.   <\/p>  <p>  Under the legislation, credits are available in certain circumstances, but only to persons who have held private health insurance.

In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded. <\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. <\/p>  <p>  Multiple Sclerosis is one of the conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).

It is proposed that, when all the registration boards have been established towards the end of 2018, the Department will ask the Health and Social Care Professionals Council (CORU) to prepare a risk assessment, in terms of public protection, of the principal health and social care professions seeking designation under the Act and to make recommendations concerning options or their possible future regulation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600077#WRU04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Support Services Funding","counter":1028,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600077#WRU05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1029,"qnumday":416,"qnumall":"[5881\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600077#WRU05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to provide increased funding for an organisation (details supplied) in 2018 in view of its requirement for extra funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1030,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses, the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System &ndash; a system of National Influenza Centres and WHO Collaborating Centres around the world &ndash; continuously monitors the influenza viruses circulating in humans and updates the composition of influenza vaccines twice a year. For many years, WHO has updated its recommendation on the composition of the vaccine (trivalent) that targets the three most representative virus types in circulation (two subtypes of influenza A viruses and one influenza B virus) and since the 2013&ndash;2014 northern hemisphere influenza season, a fourth component is recommended to support quadrivalent vaccine development. Quadrivalent vaccines include a 2nd influenza B virus in addition to the viruses in trivalent vaccines<\/p>  <p>  The influenza vaccine purchased by HSE is based on WHO advice on the composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2017\/8 northern hemisphere Flu season issued on 2 March 2017.

This season (2017\/18) the HSE procured the trivalent inactivated Influenza vaccine (Split Virion) BP seasonal influenza vaccine for all those in the recommended at risk groups and health care workers and carers.

It is also one of the most effective ways a parent can protect the health of their child. Ireland&rsquo;s childhood immunisation programmes have had a huge impact in improving the health of the Irish population.  Diseases that used to be common in this country and around the world such as polio, measles, diphtheria, whooping cough and many other serious infectious diseases are now preventable by vaccination. <\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  HPV is one of the most closely studied and monitored medicinal products.  The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of short term adverse side effects for the vaccine, as described in the product information.  The most frequently reported side effects are local redness and \/or swelling at the point of injection and fever.  These are usually mild and temporary reactions to any kind of vaccination.  Fainting has occurred after vaccination with Gardasil, especially in adolescents.   <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is committed to providing accurate information for parents about diseases, the vaccines to prevent them and side effects to allow them to choose whether to give consent to vaccination.  All the information provided to parents about vaccination is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics (SPC) and Patient Information Leaflet (PIL). <\/p>  <p>  All medicines, including vaccines are subject to on-going review and evaluation of all available data from a range of sources, including systematic scientific literature review, to consider any impact that their data may have on the overall assessment of the benefits and risks of a medicinal product.  Taking into account the totality of the available information, the benefits of the HPV vaccines continue to outweigh their risks.  The safety of these vaccines continues to be monitored at EU level through the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and its expert committees, which includes representatives from member state competent authorities such as the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines including vaccines that are licensed in Ireland and operates a national adverse reaction reporting system, which members of the public and healthcare professionals are encouraged to submit any suspected adverse reactions through this system.  All Reports received by the HPRA are routinely transmitted to the EMA's adverse reaction database for inclusion in global signal detection and monitoring activities. The Patient Information Leaflet provides information on the vaccine, its uses and on any precautions that require advice from a healthcare professional before it is administered.<\/p>  <p>  Adjuvants (immune potentiators or immunomodulators) have been used for decades to improve the immune response to vaccine antigens.  The incorporation of adjuvants into vaccine formulations is aimed at enhancing, accelerating and prolonging the specific immune response towards the desired response to vaccine antigens.  Advantages of adjuvants include the enhancement of the immunogenicity of antigens, modification of the nature of the immune response, the reduction of the antigen amount needed for a successful immunisation, the reduction of the frequency of booster immunisations needed and an improved immune response in the elderly and immunocompromised.<\/p>  <p>  The question asks me to comment on academic research concerning the HPV vaccine. It would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, to express views on individual pieces of academic research.<\/p>  <p>  I would urge any parent who has doubts or questions about vaccination to engage with their family doctor, or alternatively to visit the HPV website - www.hpv.ie.

Difficulties in harvesting fodder in some of these areas were compounded by the need to house livestock earlier than usual, resulting in additional pressure on fodder supplies over the course of the winter.  <\/p><p>I prioritised the payment of farm supports to assist farmers with cash flow.  The European Commission agreed to my request, informed in part by the poor weather conditions of last autumn, for an advance payment of the 2017 Basic Payment Scheme and Agri-environment schemes.  These payments commenced after the earliest date possible which was 15 October 2017, and balancing payments issued in early December 2017.  These payments together with those issued under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme, injected over &euro;1.3 billion into the Irish rural economy by the end of last year and are providing a very welcome boost for Irish farm families and will help to finance additional fodder purchase where necessary.<\/p><p>However, in order to provide additional assistance to those livestock farmers severely affected by ongoing fodder shortages, mainly in parts of the West and North West, I have introduced a targeted Fodder Transport Support measure operated through the Co-operative structure.  This measure applies only to fodder purchased in the period from January 29 2018 until April 20 2018.  Application forms and full details on the operation of the measure are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>Farmers, who have an identified fodder shortage, having completed a fodder budgeting exercise with their FAS agricultural advisor, will be eligible to receive a financial contribution towards offsetting the costs of transport of fodder in excess of 100 km.  As fodder is traded between farms on a regular basis, it is essential that the support measure is targeted at those who most need it and does not impact on the normal functioning of the market for fodder and for this reason a minimum transport distance applies.  Eligible applicants will receive a transport contribution of &euro;8 per standard bale of hay or straw for feeding, and &euro;12 per standard bale of silage or haylage.  <\/p><p>Financial assistance under the Fodder Transport Support Measure is payable in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408\/2013 on <i>de minimis<\/i>aid in the agricultural production sector.<\/p><p>While this measure builds on my early supports to farmers through prioritisation of farm payments, and the convening of a Fodder Group, I urge affected farmers to avail of the additional fodder budgeting support being provided by Teagasc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600080#WRX01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sheep Welfare Scheme Data","counter":1140,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600080#WRX01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1141,"qnumday":459,"qnumall":"[5358\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600080#WRX02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of persons that undertook each of the various welfare measures of the sheep welfare scheme.","asker":"1284","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1142,"content":"<p>The information\u00a0requested be the Deputy is\u00a0provided in the following table:<table><tr><th>Welfare Measures<\/th><th>Number of Persons<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Lameness Control<\/td><td>4,781<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mineral\u00a0 Supplementation Ewes post mating<\/td><td>15,819<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Parasite Control (Faecal   Egg Count)<\/td><td>1,879<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Scanning<\/td><td>11,614<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Flystrike Control<\/td><td>4,667<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meal feeding lambs post weaning<\/td><td>1,348<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mineral Supplementation Lambs pre weaning<\/td><td>3,783<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600080#WRX02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Livestock Issues","counter":1143,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600080#WRX02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1144,"qnumday":460,"qnumall":"[5359\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600080#WRX02300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the dates on which fluke alerts were issued in 2017.","asker":"1284","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1145,"content":"<p>My Department issued a press release\u00a0detailing the forecast for liver fluke\u00a0for the winter period on 21 November 2017.  <\/p><p>This forecast was published on my Department's website and was also reported\u00a0in a number of\u00a0farming publications and in a number regional newspapers between 24 November and 2 December.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600080#WRX02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme Eligibility","counter":1146,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600080#WRX02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1147,"qnumday":461,"qnumall":"[5388\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600080#WRX02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if additional funding is available to young farmers in addition to the 60% grant for those that are in partnership with their parents on the family farm;

forestry, by county, in each of the years 2013 to 2017.","asker":"1345","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1228,"content":"<p>The EIA Directive (meaning Directive 2011\/92\/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 as amended by Directive 2014\/52\/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014) requires that certain types of development, including afforestation and forest road works, must be assessed to determine the likely environmental effect of the development, before a licence can be granted.<\/p>  <p>  The licensing system operated by my Department, as set out in the Forestry Regulations 2017, (SI 191\/2017), (&ldquo;the Regulations&rdquo;), provides for an environmental impact assessment (EIA) to be carried out in certain cases. \u00a0An EIA is mandatory for initial afforestation involving an area of 50 hectares or more, and for forest road works involving a length of 2,000 metres or more. \u00a0Applications for such projects must be accompanied by an environmental impact statement (EIS), to enable my Department to undertake the EIA. \u00a0An EIS is an environmental impact assessment report satisfying the requirements of Article 5.1 of the EU Directive and prepared by competent experts. \u00a0The information to be contained in an EIS is set out in Schedule 4 of the Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Forestry Regulations 2017 provide that all proposed afforestation and forest road works below the above mandatory thresholds must be screened for EIA, to consider whether or not significant effects on the environment are likely. \u00a0This consideration must take into account criteria involving the characteristic of the project, its location, and the type and characteristics of the potential impact, as set out in Schedule 3 of the Regulations. \u00a0Where it is considered that a proposed sub-threshold development is likely to have significant effects on the environment and should therefore be subject to an EIA, my Department requires the applicant to submit an EIS to enable the EIA to be undertaken.<\/p>  <p>  EIA screening is an assessment undertaken by my Department as part of the normal procedure for evaluating the silvicultural and environmental suitability of a proposed development. \u00a0The District Forestry Inspector undertakes EIA screening by responding to questions under the various headings: project description; existing land use; cumulative effect and extent of the project; water; soil; protection of Freshwater Pearl Mussel; archaeology; landscape; designated habitats; non-designated habitats; social; accidents; trans-frontier; public participation and NGO participation. \u00a0This is supported by spatial analysis concerning the area of forest within various hinterlands of the proposed development. \u00a0In undertaking the EIA screening, the Inspector uses information gained from their scrutiny of aerial photographs of the site and various Geographic Information System (GIS) layers available in the IFORIS mapping system, combined with their knowledge gained through (inter alia) the scrutiny of other third party datasets, through field inspection, and through a review of referral responses (if any) received from consulted bodies, and submissions from third parties.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has various options to address individual environmental concerns that arise in relation to a proposed forest development. \u00a0For example, specific conditions, such as increased setbacks or exclusions, can be added to the licence, to avoid any impact. \u00a0My Department may seek further information in the form of an expert report in relation to, e.g. archaeology; potential Annex 1 habitats; concerns regarding groundwater; and address any potential impacts identified thorough licence conditions. \u00a0Furthermore, my Department has incorporated several protocols into the assessment process, designed to avoid impact concerning particular sensitivities, e.g. surface water acidification; Hen Harrier; Curlew; Freshwater Pearl Mussel; and Small White Orchid.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, while the EIA screening process may identify potential environmental impacts, these can often be addressed in an individual basis and do not culminate in a significant environment impact, which would otherwise trigger an EIA.\u00a0 No environmental impact assessments were carried out in relation to afforestation in the years 2013 to 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600082#WRZ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS

I have also\u00a0welcomed the harmonised approach\u00a0subsequently taken to the more intensified checks\u00a0carried out on product from Brazil at EU Border Inspection Posts, and in which Ireland has played\u00a0a full part. <\/p>  <p>  It is vitally important that meat and meat products being exported from any country to the EU fully comply with EU standards, and that there are robust and reliable systems in place to ensure that this is the case.

Indeed my colleague, Minister of State Andrew Doyle, made a very strong intervention on this point at\u00a0last week's Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in Brussels, and spoke to Commissioner Hogan on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  I have been very consistent in urging caution in the approach to these negotiations, and have expressed\u00a0Ireland's very grave concerns about the offer of a beef tariff rate quota of 70,000 tonnes made by the EU to Mercosur last October, and our determination not to have this exceeded.<\/p>  <p>  I believe there is a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of these trade negotiations, and I\u00a0will continue to insist\u00a0that they are\u00a0handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector.  I will also continue to work very closely with Member State colleagues in this regard.  In particular, I believe full account must be taken of\u00a0the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s own assessment of the cumulative impact of trade deals on the agri food sector,\u00a0and the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600082#WRZ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"TAMS Applications","counter":1238,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600082#WRZ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1239,"qnumday":493,"qnumall":"[5966\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600082#WRZ01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the case of an application for a TAMS grant by a partnership (details supplied) will be examined; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1240,"content":"<p>The applicants in question applied under TAMS II for a slurry tanker, trailing shoe and dribble bar but only submitted a claim for and were paid for the slurry tanker and dribble bar. <\/p>  <p>  The applicants indicate that they now wish to purchase an umbilical slurry spreading system but have yet to make an application.

The study will be completed by the end of February and I will consider the findings at that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600082#WRZ04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":1267,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600082#WRZ04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1268,"qnumday":503,"qnumall":"[5409\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600082#WRZ04500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of ecar power points planned and available to the public in each local authority area, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1269,"content":"<p>The ESB, through its eCars programme, has rolled out an extensive public charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs) with approximately 900 EV charge points of which circa 70 are rapid chargers.\u00a0 A map showing all public charge points in Ireland, including the status and availability of the charge points, is available on the ESB&rsquo;s website at www.esb.ie\/ecars.<font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The management and possible\u00a0future expansion of its eCars network is an operational matter for the ESB.\u00a0\u00a0The recent decision by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU)\u00a0in relation to the future ownership of the public charging infrastructure envisages the sale of the infrastructure by ESB Networks in the long-term.\u00a0 However, the continued ownership of the charging network by ESB Networks for a transitional period of up to ten years is provided for in order to safeguard those who rely on public electric vehicle charging infrastructure and result in as little impact to the network as possible in the short to medium term.\u00a0 <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The table, provided by ESB eCars, sets out in tabular form the number of current publically available standard and fast chargers available in each county.\u00a0 It should be noted that as such, this list is limited to ESB eCars charge points and would not include any installations on private sites such as hotels.<\/font><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>No of\u00a0standard posts*<\/th><th>No of standard charge points <\/th><th>No of fast stations<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan <\/td><td>6<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>82<\/td><td>164<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare <\/td><td>14<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow <\/td><td>6<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>58<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*Each AC standard\u00a0post contains two charge points <\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">I secured additional funding in Budget 2018 to support the provision of public charging.\u00a0 The Low Emissions Vehicle Taskforce, which is co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is considering a range of options for effective and efficient EV charging.

There is no exhaustive list of all expenses allowed in self-employed cases, since expenses vary with the nature and extent of the self-employment. <\/p><p>The main allowable expenses in most instances are as set out in the means guidelines available on the Departmental website: <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that the first &euro;30 per week means (from any source including self-employment) is disregarded for State pension (non-contributory) purposes, and that this amount is doubled in the case of a couple.<\/p><p>Furthermore, a farmer in receipt of the State Pension (non-contributory) can also benefit from the disregard that exists for certain farm payments administered by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, such as the Agri-Environment Options Scheme.  The first &euro;2,540 of this and similar payments is fully disregarded, with 50% of the remainder assessed as means.<\/p><p>Where a claimant for the State pension (non-contributory) is in employment, a weekly earnings disregard of &euro;200 per week applies.  This disregard is intended to facilitate non-contributory pensioners who wish to continue working, or to re-enter the workforce.<\/p><p>There are currently no plans to amend the means assessment for the State Pension (non-contributory) scheme.  Any such changes to the current means testing arrangements for self-employed pensioners generally would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600086#WRDD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Offices","counter":1485,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600086#WRDD04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1486,"qnumday":578,"qnumall":"[5430\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600086#WRDD04800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the closure of the social welfare office in Castlepollard, County Westmeath will be reconsidered (details supplied).","asker":"1250","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1487,"content":"<p>The Department currently has 58 Social Welfare Branch Offices at various locations throughout the country.

The report can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website at the following link.<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>The report detailed employment outcomes on a quarterly cohort basis, i.e. customers referred in Quarter 3 and 4 in 2015 and those referred in Quarter 1 and 2 in 2016.<\/p><p>The data is encouraging as the total employment outcome at the time of publishing was 25%: 18% of Jobseekers who engaged with the service during this period obtained full time employment.  In addition, a further 4% of clients entered part time employment and a further 3% became self-employed.<\/p><p>The number of clients, at the time of publishing, to remain in full time employment for 3 months was 4,619.  In addition, the total number of clients to sustain 3 months' employment is broken down by quarterly referral cohort within the report.  The number of clients to remain in full time employment for 6 months was 3,422.  Again this total number is then broken down by quarterly referral cohort within the report.<\/p><p>The JobPath service was launched on a rolling basis with referral numbers increasing over time.  The two latter cohorts (Q1 and Q2 2016) make up 80% of the total referrals (80% of the 39,603 jobseekers) between July 2015 and June 2016.  Consequently not enough clients have completed their period of engagement with the service to produce robust data in terms of nine and twelve month outcomes.  However, the department is undertaking an econometric review of this strand of its services with completion of the review scheduled for Q3 2018, following which more detailed statistics will be available.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that jobseekers may be supported through the service for up to 30 months and as such these statistics are a snapshot at a point in time.  The duration of the client journey necessitates the requirement of a cohort-based approach to reporting and the updating of outcome data over time: for example the performance of the latter two cohorts (Q1 and Q2 2016) are expected to improve over time as more jobseekers complete their full engagement period with the service.<\/p><p>In designing the JobPath service the department took steps to ensure the focus would be on sustained employment outcomes, rather than the traditional measurement of such contracts i.e. outcomes based on jobseekers being &lsquo;placed into \/ starting&rsquo; employment.  As a result the Department only makes payments for full time employment outcomes that last a minimum of 13 weeks.  The department is therefore not reporting on or making payments for any job sustainment outcomes of less than 13 weeks e.g. full time employment of 12 weeks' duration - which will have been beneficial to the Jobseeker.<\/p><p>It should be noted, where a client starts a job but subsequently returns to the live register the client returns to their original individual personal advisor who will continue to work with them to support them in their efforts to obtain further employment.<\/p><p>Of the 39,603 jobseekers referred to the service during the period July 2015 and June 2016, 58% were over three years unemployed and a further 17% were over two years unemployed.

Waiting days have been a long standing feature of social insurance schemes and are a feature of similar social security schemes in many other countries.<\/p>  <p>  The SIF operates on a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; basis, with the Exchequer acting as residual financier of the fund when there is a shortfall between contributions received and benefits paid.  The fund is central to Ireland&rsquo;s system of social protection and there is a fundamental requirement that it should be protected for current and future generations.  In order to ensure the sustainability of the Fund, the number of waiting days was increased in 2014 from three to six.  This increase in waiting days was a relatively modest adjustment and many employees still receive their salaries when out sick where their employers have occupational sick pay arrangements in place.

section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.<\/p>  <p>  My Department may recoup housing authorities up to 90% of payments reasonably made. Under the section 10 funding arrangements that are in place between my Department and housing authorities, exchequer funding is provided on a regional basis, whereby payments are made to a designated lead-authority which is responsible for the disbursement of this exchequer funding, within the region.  Housing authorities are currently in the process of submitting estimated 2018 expenditure programmes, which my Department will consider before notifying lead-authorities of delegated regional allocations.<\/p>  <p>  The 2018 delegated regional funding allocations will be made primarily in respect of scheduled services, i.e. those where a service level agreement is in place between the authority and the service provider.  Given the demand-led nature of homelessness and the increased rates of homeless presentation in recent times, it is recognised that it is not possible for authorities to be fully accurate in relation to forecast expenditure, e.g. the costs of emergency accommodation, and consequently, significant expenditure may also arise outside of the provisions of the delegated funding allocations.  Accordingly, this year, as in previous years, my Department has provided reassurance that all expenditure reasonably incurred will be considered for recoupment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600089#WRGG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Charges Administration","counter":1617,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600089#WRGG01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1618,"qnumday":623,"qnumall":"[5745\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600089#WRGG01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the legal position for homeowners who wish to sell their homes and who have not paid the domestic water charge, in view of the abolition of domestic water charges in 2017.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1619,"content":"<p>The Water Services Act 2017 (No. 29 of 2017), which was enacted on 17 November 2017, reflects the recommendations of the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, which was published in April 2017 and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas. <\/p>  <p>  The Act provides for the discontinuance of domestic water charges for dwellings as set out in the Water Services Act 2014 and for the refund of domestic charges paid by customers.

The building regulations apply to the design and construction of a building or to an extension or material alteration of a building.

These requirements are set out in 12 parts classified as Parts A to M.<\/p><p>Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) provide technical guidance on how to comply with the building regulations in practical terms.

This Volume 2 applies to dwelling houses only. Important revisions in the TGD B Volume 2 include enhanced provision for fire detection and alarm systems in dwelling houses, guidance on fire safety in community dwelling houses, guidance on timber frame construction, including new provisions in respect of timber frame party walls, enhanced provisions in respect of loft conversions, new provisions for galleries in dwelling houses and other general updates.  Volume 1 is being prepared for public consultation.<\/p><p>Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings.  Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who have extensive powers of inspection and investigation under the Acts.<\/p><p>The statutory requirements in relation to Fire Safety Certificates are set out in the Building Control Act 1990, as amended by Part 2 of the Building Control Act 2007, and in regulations made thereunder.  A Fire Safety Certificate is a certificate granted by a local Building Control Authority which specifies that the works or building to which the application relates will, if carried out in accordance with the plans and specifications submitted, comply with the requirements of Part B of the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations.  A Fire Safety Certificate is generally required before construction work is commenced in the case of a new apartment block, a new building other than a dwelling or an existing building other than a dwelling undergoing an extension, a material alteration or a material change of use.  A building used as a dwelling other than a flat is exempted from the requirement to obtain a Fire Safety Certificate.<\/p><p>The process of Agr&eacute;ment certification applies to those products and processes which do not fall within the scope of existing construction standards, either because they are innovative or because they deviate from established norms.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) Agr&eacute;ment assesses, specifies testing, and where appropriate, issues Agr&eacute;ment certificates confirming that new building products, materials, techniques and equipment are safe and fit for purpose in accordance with the Irish Building Regulations and with the terms of the certificate. <\/p><p>The NSAI is an autonomous body under the aegis of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  I understand that the issue raised in relation to Irish Agr&eacute;ment Certificate 04\/0198 has been brought to the attention of the NSAI.<\/p><p>It is important to note that in accordance with the recommendations of the <i>Timber Frame Housing Report<\/i>, a standard in relation to timber frame construction was developed subsequent to the provision of the Agr&eacute;ment Certificate in question.  Irish Standard 440: 2009\/A1:2014 Timber Frame Construction, Dwellings and other Buildings (I.S. 440) specifies requirements for materials, design, manufacture, construction details, site work and quality control for platform timber frame construction.  It requires that the responsibilities for the tasks involved in the planning, structural design, site erection and inspection be agreed and recorded prior to the commencement of each project. I.S. 440 also gives specific details relating to fire, including the construction of separating walls, horizontal and vertical fire stopping, cavity barriers and detailed fire stopping junctions for walls and floors and service penetrations.  I understand that I.S. 440 is currently under review, and it is intended that both external and party wall new constructions and methods will be included in the next revision of the document.  Manufacturers of timber frame buildings are assessed under an approval scheme operated by NSAI for compliance with I.S. 440 requirements including Factory Production Control (FPC) and a register of compliant manufacturers is available on the NSAI website at <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>It should also be noted that my Department has recently issued guidance to all Building Control Authorities on Timber Frame Walls, which have been tested to the European standard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600089#WRGG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Safety","counter":1623,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600089#WRGG01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1624,"qnumday":625,"qnumall":"[5775\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020600089#WRGG01800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will publish the interim report of the high level task force that was established after the Grenfell Tower fire under the direction of the national directorate for fire and emergency management; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1625,"content":"<p>In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy of 14 June 2017, and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, I tasked my Department&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management with convening and coordinating a high-level Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of fire safety in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities were directed also to undertake a review of fire safety in multi-storey social housing buildings and also to review fire safety in medium to high rise buildings in their functional areas.

The Fire Safety Task Force established two sub-groups which have reviewed the returns received. <\/p>  <p>  The returns indicate that multi-storey social housing buildings in Ireland are generally designed, built and equipped appropriately for domestic fire risk. In the category of medium to high rise buildings, (greater than 6 stories or 18 m high) more than 800 buildings were identified through the national survey undertaken.  A number of these were identified as having specific external cladding systems and building owners have been required by local authorities, using their powers under the Fire Services Act, to assess fire safety in these specific buildings in more detail.  National guidance on further actions in light of the results of these fire safety assessments, taking account of emerging information on the cladding issue from international sources, was prepared by the Task Force Sub-Group and was published by my Department in late December 2017.
