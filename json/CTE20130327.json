They are very welcome and overdue.  I commend the Department on coming forward with them.  What resources does the Department feel will be required to ensure that the objectives set out in the guidelines will be achieved, and to support teachers and other school staff to ensure that we protect our children as well as we can and give them the support they require.  The reduction this year in the guidance counselling service, following last year's budget decision to remove the &euro;32 million allocated to guidance counselling hours, requiring schools to use teaching hours instead and draw on the same funding pot, has had a serious impact on ensuring best protection of students' mental health.  Guidance counsellors are trained to assist students and without them we would need to develop a support network and similar service to enact the guidelines.  It is counter-productive to on the one hand try to introduce guidelines and on the other diminish the capacity of schools to support students as best they can.  We must ensure that there is a whole-school approach and all members of staff must be aware of students' needs and play their part.  There is, however, a one-to-one service provided by qualified guidance counsellors who have gone through the appropriate training.  It is important that whenever somebody is referred and knocks on the guidance counsellor's door there is somebody behind that door.  They often deal with crises, which need to be addressed immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032700003#D00400","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1364389200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Due to time constraints I might bank some questions.

It is very worthwhile.  We need a more child-centred approach to this issue.  Last year during the course of the debate before the referendum on the Thirty-First Amendment of the Constitution (Children) Bill it was discovered and brought to our notice that over 30,000 children had welfare concerns, some of which related to bullying and other issues such as mental health problems.  While supports for parents dealt with many of those, many related to mental health problems.<\/p><p>  Our system has changed compared with that of two generations back.  Most parents work and there is very little communication between parents and children, due to financial constraints.  After school care systems are largely underdeveloped here compared with other countries.  That needs to be addressed fairly urgently.  Children do not need money.  We did not have money when we were going school.  Money is given to children today and they have plenty of cash.  They need other supports, they need adults and personnel around them to take an interest in their points of view.  This is absent from a child's life today.  When I was going to school I never heard a child say he or she was fed up.  We did not have the same number of electronic devices as children today have.  There is an absence of services for young children when their parents are working.  How can this be addressed?  There is a serious lack of resources and support for children and there are real enemies which lead to personal tragedies in many children's lives.  Something needs to be done to address this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032700003#D00700","speaker":"1062"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364389200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The Minister has allocated &euro;500,000 this year to begin implementing the action plan on bullying.

We operate in a climate in which we have a ceiling on teacher numbers and fixed payroll budgets which we have to manage at a time of increasing demographics.  The choice for Government when it was making its budgetary decision on guidance counsellors was to increase the pupil-teacher ratio or to bring guidance within quota.  It chose to bring guidance within the standard allocation.  It is important to bear in mind that all schools are required to provide guidance within the quota.  In the past there were over 700 whole-time equivalent guidance posts.  The budget saving yielded 500 posts and we used the extra 200 posts to shelter the most disadvantaged, the DEIS schools.<\/p> <p> The 200 DEIS post-primary schools had an increase in their staffing allocation.  For example, in the past a 500-pupil DEIS school, which would be fairly typical, would have had an allocation of about 29 teachers plus one guidance post, making a total of 30.  Typically, one guidance post would have been allocated for every 500 pupils.  Based on the increased staffing allocation given to the DEIS schools this year, that school would have been given 30 posts.  In a sense, all the DEIS schools are largely unaffected by the Government decision to bring guidance posts within quota and they were sheltered.  However, the non-DEIS schools are affected.  A non-DEIS 500-pupil school has to manage guidance counselling within its allocation of 29 teachers.  Equally, if the budget decision was different and the pupil-teacher ratio was changed, such a non-DEIS school would have to manage such provision within an allocation of 29 teachers.  That is the context here.<\/p><p> On the wider issue of guidance, a whole-school approach is the best way to provide it.  It is best that it is not only the sole focus of the guidance teacher in the school.  It is the focus of everyone in the school and the whole-school approach is the best way to address it.  The management bodies in the school system and the Association of Principals and Deputy Principals provided a framework for schools and gave guidance to them on how to manage within that framework.  The focus of it is to maximise the way in which they use their resources.  All of us in the public sector have to achieve more with less.  That applies to the Department and agencies, and schools are no different.  Schools cannot be exempt from that requirement.  We shelter them as much as we can.  There are clear options in terms of maximising this resource in that as much as possible of the career guidance element is delivered in class settings rather than on a one-to-one basis and that as much of the guidance counsellor's time as possible is targeted towards those pupils who need one-to-one support.  I  will ask Ms Doreen McMorris to add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032700003#D00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Loftus","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364389800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I will speak about the important role guidance counsellors play but I wish to return to the point made about the specialist qualifications of guidance counsellors.  It is true they are qualified to provide counselling support for students.  It is important to distinguish between that type of support and the type of qualification a professional counsellor would have.  The guidance counsellors in our schools undertake a postgraduate qualification.  They are first and foremost teachers.  They undertake a postgraduate qualification to enable them to provide a guidance counselling service in our schools.  That involves counselling support but it also equips them to fulfil a much wider remit, which very much includes planning for guidance.  The guidance plan in a school, which should be part of the whole-school plan, is critically important.  It should lay out all the different forms of support for students and those supports are delivered by different people in different ways.  The one-to-one support provided by guidance counsellors is well recognised as being very important.  The Department's circular, which was issued at the time of the removal of the ex quota allocation, clearly states that schools should prioritise guidance counsellors' time for the one-to-one counselling that is necessary.  There is no doubt about that, but it is important to realise that many other members of the school community are well positioned to support students in different ways.<\/p><p>  As Mr. Hubert Loftus has outlined, schools now have the autonomy to decide how best to use their resources.  It might be of interest to the members to note that in 2006 and 2007 the inspectorate undertook inspections in 55 post-primary schools across the different sectors.  It is of significance that at that time just under a third of schools were found not to be using their ex quota allocation for guidance.  It appears at that time when schools had an ex quota allocation that allocation was not always given to the guidance area.  That is an important point to remember.  Schools principals and boards now have full autonomy to decide what portion of the overall resourcing should go into this area.<\/p><p>  It appears from research that students feel comfortable approaching a range of different people for support - it is not always the guidance counsellor.  Some ESRI research conducted in 2006 shows that also.  There is general recognition that schools have an important role in terms of prevention and identifying students with needs but it is not as clear who should be providing such support.  It is important to remember that in terms of our young people.  Responsibility in this respect must be spread across the area and young people have a wide variety of needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032700004#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Doreen McMorris"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364389800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>The key to the successful implementation of the mental health guidelines lies in taking a co-ordinated whole-school approach and the guidelines set out the existing elements that are available to schools such as school staff evaluation processes, the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum, whole-school guidance planning, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, continuum of support and the inter-agency collaboration and support that is available externally to schools.  The guidelines set out the integration of all those elements which are already in place.  The services for schools to support this are already in existence.  For example, the Social, Personal and Health Education Support Service is available to provide training for schools, and my colleague, Ms Frances Shearer, may wish to say more about that.<\/p><p>  I represent NEPS.  Our service is available to support schools in promoting mental health.  In collaboration with the SPHE support service, we would be available to schools to build on the professional development work they do with teachers.  We would be available to advise and support schools on whole-school guidance planning and on developing student support structures and teams.  Schools can draw on the expertise in our service for their developmental needs.  We also provide Incredible Years teacher training which focuses on behaviour management and classroom management.  We are currently rolling out the Friends for Life programme.  It uses a cognitive behavioural approach to managing anxiety and stress and is applicable at primary and post-primary level.  The elements in that programme complement and are part of the SPHE curriculum.  In addition, the NEPS provides guidelines and support to schools to deal with crises or tragic events that may occur.  This is very important in terms of prevention.  Our focus is on early intervention and prevention.  The continuum of support which has been rolled out by NEPS to primary schools since 2007 and to post-primary schools since 2010 is a framework for schools whereby we ask them to identify early on the needs and supports young people require before those needs become serious difficulties.  In terms of our work with schools, it is on that area we will be focusing our attention in the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032700004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Margaret Grogan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364389800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I wish to say a few words about my own experience of having been involved in the SPHE support service for the past 12 years.  We have had a stand-alone SPHE support service for all that time, which has been a considerable time in which to support schools to embed a subject like SPHE which was very new 12 years ago.  It came into the curriculum in 2000.  Over that time I have observed a growing awareness among schools of the importance of subjects like SPHE, but the other big change in the past three or four years has been the high level of awareness among schools of the importance of the whole-school context.  There was somewhat of a view that SPHE dealt with health subjects and young people with problems went to the guidance counsellor.  There has been a much broader understanding of this area during the past number of years and that has been evidenced in the past four or five years in the improved and significantly greater level of engagement we have had with schools.  Our numbers of teachers coming out have doubled in the past three or four years and the largest source of that increase has been whole-staff work.  There has been a tremendous appetite from schools for workshops on promoting the welfare of students; it is probably our most popular whole-staff workshop.  Bullying prevention and intervention is the next most popular one.<\/p> <p>The concept of student well-being in the broadest sense, supported by the whole school, is becoming very well established.  The mental health guidelines will obviously support that.  Another very important development is the new junior cycle framework, which is permeated with the concept of well-being.  This will constitute further support and impetus for schools towards taking good care of young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032700004#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Shearer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364390400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I will not keep the delegation long because, in fairness to it, it has covered many of the issues I was going to raise, particularly on raising awareness among and teaching parents.

With me are Eleanor McClorey from Young Ballymun, Marie-Louise Neary from Headstrong, Annette Clarke, schools facilitator in the Jigsaw Meath project, which was referred to earlier, and Moira Leydon from the ASTI.  We expected to attend before the committee on 24 April 2013 and had lined up Professor Margaret Barry, an international expert on this topic, to speak.  She addressed a seminar we held last March, which was excellent.<\/p> <p>I would like to let the committee know that Professor Barry is not available today but would be available on 24 April if members would like to hear more about this topic.<\/p><p> We welcome the fact that the guidelines have been published.  It is an important development.  The coalition comprises approximately 55 member organisations from a range of backgrounds and sectors ranging from the children's rights and human rights sectors to the educational and mental health services sector.  <\/p><p> We made a submission to the Department of Education and Skills last September on the topic of mental health in the education system.  We welcome the publication of the guidelines and the fact that they adopt a whole-school approach.  Young people's mental health and well-being are recognised as fundamental to the achievement of educational goals.  The economic benefits of early intervention in the area of mental health are well established.  Schools are uniquely placed to promote positive mental health but also to pick up on and be an early identifier of students who are in distress and to be a referral point for students.<\/p><p> Members will have copies of a document I prepared.  I will not have the time to go through all of it but I will bring the members briefly through it.  Studies have shown that it is important to move beyond an individual curriculum-based focus or classroom focus and instead to have a whole-school complex approach to mental health promotion.  It is a multi-component approach which involves the whole school and the community, with different levels of intervention and a wide range of people involved.  It is quite a complex model to put in place but it is very worthwhile for schools and communities to implement it.  There are good examples of how this is being done in Ireland.  We have the Jigsaw Meath project, as was mentioned, and Young Ballymun is doing excellent work with primary schools in adopting a whole-school approach.  While the guidelines are a very welcome development, vital factors are missing in terms of their implementation, which are needed if the guidelines are to become a reality in schools.  <\/p><p> I will first address the issue of resources, which many members raised with the representatives of the Department of Education and Skills.  The guidelines for mental health do not bring with them any additional resources to ensure their successful implementation.  Schools are expected to implement the guidelines within already thinly stretched resources but fundamentally without access to any additional professional consultation or support.  We consider the need for such financial support or resources as twofold, and recognising the fact that there has been a change in the allocation of funding for guidance counsellors, this is all the more crucial.  <\/p><p> Schools may need advice, training and support on how best to implement a whole-school approach to this area.  While the guidelines provide some guidance on this, which I welcome, Ms Margaret Grogan from the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, talked about the systemic work it does with schools.  NEPS has continuously pointed out over the years that it is not sufficiently resourced to do that systematic work with schools to develop a psychologically supportive environment on the scale that is needed because the demands on it for psychological assessments are so high that it does not have the resources required.  We argue that resources should be put in place to support schools in doing that.  <\/p><p> Schools need to have access to backup and consultation on how to manage the mental health needs of individual students in the educational context.  This can sometimes help to shift the focus from referral and assessment, which I appreciate is also important.  However, other forms of advice and consultation for schools on how best to support the student within the school setting could involve NEPS, and they should also involve other agencies like CAMHS, the national education support service, and the National Education Welfare Board, NEWB.  A range of agencies should be involved.<\/p><p> The lack of funding for implementation of the mental health guidelines is in stark contrast with the allocation of funding for the implementation of the anti-bullying guidelines.  I point out for the information of the members that in Scotland it was recently announced that &pound;1 million is to be allocated annually to implement its mental health in schools programme to increase training in specialist skills and service design.  It introduced a self-assessment system in 2005, similar to the guidelines we published recently, but it found in recent reviews that this did not meet the requirements of schools.  There was a lack of co-ordination, backup and consultation for schools.  It has changed its approach on realising that there is a need for more intensive support.  It sends out a signal in terms of the priority being given to mental health in the Department of Education and Skills that guidelines have not come with the resources required for their implementation.<\/p><p> I wish to move on to an issue that was raised with regard to clarity of responsibility and the interaction between agencies, which is crucial to the implementation of these guidelines.  We need clarity about the relationship among schools, NEPS, CAMHS, primary care psychology services, the NEWB, the National Behaviour Support Service, NBSS, and the Special Education Support Service.  Members of the coalition report to us and we have a broad range of mental health professionals involved as well, but there is a lack of clarity around the country on what their role is in terms of mental health in schools.  The guidelines state: \"As the availability and accessibility of services vary across the country, schools should identify the services available in their area and develop referral protocols with them.\"  This is something to which the Department has referred.  It is a very difficult task for schools to figure out on their own.  It involves multiple factors, many of which are completely outside their control.  I welcome the fact that Ms Margaret Grogan said that NEPS would be working closely with CAMHS on this, but this needs to be dealt with at a national level.  There needs to be national policy for inter-agency co-operation, and agreed working practices need to be developed.  Any mapping of this inter-agency work should incorporate key officials and senior responsibility for the implementation of the guidelines.  This is crucial to establishing proper referral pathways for schools but also to having a consistent nationwide approach.  I appreciate that services will differ in local areas.  With the imminent appointment of a director of mental health services, there is an opportunity to assign senior responsibility for mental health in schools within that directorate, but it should also be jointly managed and overseen by the Department of Education and Skills in terms of senior responsibility for the area of mental health in schools.  We consider this to be crucial.<\/p><p> Another element with regard to the implementation of the guidelines - this leads on from inter-agency collaboration - is the lack of a co-ordination office.  We recommend that there should be a HSE liaison office that would advise, organise and oversee this joint agency approach.  It would also provide schools with the necessary guidance and advice they need from mental health professionals.  This could work at both national and regional level.  There could be a national co-ordinator to ensure consistency but at a regional level such an office could facilitate schools in meeting in groups, which would provide for a better use of the various resources with the input of SPHE support staff, HSE health promotion staff, NEPS, NEBS, the Special Education Support Service, local GPs and primary care psychology services.  That would provide for a sharing of resources and a sharing of the experience of the whole-school approach within schools, with schools building on knowledge and supporting each other on how to do this within the whole community.  Those regional clusters could form part of a national schools mental health network and this could greatly enhance the three tiers of support within the guidelines - support for all, support for some and support for few.  In our document we have outlined some of the ways in which that could be done.  This would be a clever use of resources, and rather than directing resources to schools, it would maximise those resources and it would enhance inter-agency collaboration.  Mental health and well-being in education spans many agencies, and there is a risk that without the assignation of responsibility and without a co-ordination body, this will fall between stools.  This is something about which the coalition is very concerned.<\/p><p> I wish to address the final areas of teacher training and a roadmap for schools.  Teacher training is an issue that has been raised.  I would like to acknowledge the excellent work that the SPHE support service, NEPS and the HSE mental health promotion officers do in terms of providing training.  Studies have shown that training in terms of mental health is patchy and inconsistent around the country.  The resources of the SPHE support service, the HSE mental health promotion officers and NEPS are not sufficient to provide training on the scale that is needed to implement these guidelines.  The coalition in its submission recommended that there should be initial teacher education and continuous professional development on mental health awareness and that this training should include how to recognise when a child or young person is in distress. It should be the responsibility of all teachers to understand and recognise needs in this area to feed into the whole-school approach.  The coalition recommended that this should included in training for teachers at all levels, from preschool up to third level.  We also stressed the importance of social and emotional learning for very young children in our submission.<\/p> <p>It is important that the upskilling and training of teachers is not a one-off occurrence because research shows that it is important to the development of teacher competencies that one does not restrict it solely to training.  Extensive evidence supports the need for coaching and feedback to realise the implementation of effective practices in the classroom.  Again, we think there are great opportunities in terms of initial teacher training but also in the development of CPD.  Within the guidelines there is reference to training that is available in mental health but no specific training has been designed for the implementation of the guidelines.<\/p><p> That leads me to the roadmap for schools in terms of implementing the whole-school approach.  While we welcome the guidelines, in many ways the implementation of the whole-school approach is complex.  It seeks to make changes in the social and learning environment, strengthen the structures of each school for addressing mental health promotion and promote links between the school and the community.  We agree that it takes great commitment from the school and there is a need for school leadership, but we feel that the guidelines are not specific enough in providing the roadmap.<\/p><p> The groups Jigsaw and Headstrong are present today.  A whole-school approach to mental health in schools has been put in place by Jigsaw in a small number of schools around the country and its model provides an example of a framework for putting in place a whole-school approach to mental health, as well as the kind of integration of services that is required and the supports that are necessary for schools to successfully implement it.  While the guidelines do endorse a whole-school approach, we feel that the roadmap in those guidelines is not sufficiently clear or easy to put in place without those crucial supports for schools to ensure its implementation.  We have people present who can answer questions on what is involved.<\/p><p> My final point relates to the guidelines for primary schools.  The guidelines that have been produced relate only to post-primary schools.  The coalition considers it crucial that guidelines on mental health and social and emotional well-being are introduced from preschools right up to the third level sector.  At primary school level this kind of training is often referred to as social and emotional learning.  These are critical competencies.  They involve skills that help children to calm themselves when angry, to initiate friendships and to resolve conflicts respectfully.  At primary school level there is widespread evidence that this kind of social and emotional development has a significant impact on a child&rsquo;s ability to engage with and adapt to the demands of school.<\/p><p> Ms McClorey from Young Ballymun can tell members a bit more about the situation.  Through the support of Young Ballymun, a number of primary schools in the area have implemented a whole-school approach to social and emotional learning.  It is done through multi-level Incredible Years initiatives with teachers but also with children and parent components within it.  The independent research recently published by Young Ballymun demonstrates significant improvements in the social and emotional well-being of children.  A critical dimension to the success achieved in Ballymun is through the whole-school approach to children's social and emotional development based on the implementation of the evidence-based social and emotional learning, SEL, curriculum.  It has been integrated in the classroom through management strategies embedded in the delivery of the parent programmes and community organisations.  Such an ethos requires support structures.  We recommend that the Department seek to put guidelines in place at primary level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032700007#H02000","nonspeaker":"Ms R&oacute;is&iacute;n Webb","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364392800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>We have three presentations today and I wish to conclude this section of the meeting at 3 p.m.  We want to get the maximum out of the encounter.

Is there a signal that progress is about to be made in that regard, or are people waiting to hear when the new director for mental health is appointed whether real attention will be given to the area?<\/p><p>  What lessons have emerged from the recent projects supported by Headstrong?  I did some work with Headstrong and consulted Tony Bates and Orlaith Foley prior to developing the party's policy.  We need to have such a model around the country.  If we had such services then schools would know how much could be done in the school setting to support children with low-level problems and to create a good environment, normalise talk about positive mental health and get rid of the stigma surrounding mental health issues.  We must ensure there are proper community supports with the assistance of projects such as Jigsaw.  Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAMHS, must be accessible.  That is where the big gap appears to be at the moment.  I understand children can wait for up to a year for an appointment with a psychologist with CAMHS.<\/p><p>  What lessons were learned from the Headstrong initiative in terms of getting integrated services working locally?  How did Headstrong get around the challenges and how can we roll out a model around the country?  It would be useful to hear from Ms McClorey about Young Ballymun because it relates to a big gap that exists.  It is all very well to intervene with a teenager from the age of 12 upwards but, as was correctly pointed out, problems develop much earlier than that - at preschool and primary level - so it is important that we hear that perspective.<\/p><p>  I will conclude with a suggestion.  It was useful to have the officials from the Department of Education and Skills present but it would probably be more useful for the committee to meet with officials from the Department of Health.  The Vice Chairman alluded to this point also.  The gap is with regard to the psychological services, as the behavioural aspect of the issue is not covered by the Department of Education and Skills.

I was a guidance counsellor in a school at that time.  A number of other suicides occurred also, and there was a great fear that the number of suicides would escalate.  The Health Service Executive was wonderful.  Its personnel came into the school and helped us.  From that day on we knew we could work together in a collaborative way.  I was the guidance counsellor and the psychologists were able to work with me to screen out children who were at risk, and I was able to have a direct referral route from the school into the services of the HSE.  It all started in 2006, and the project got moving in 2007.  It has been developing, and bringing psychologists into the school to consult with staff members has shown that the guidelines will work.<\/p><p> In terms of the way Jigsaw Meath works, we have two essential structures in the schools.  We have an adolescent health team, which consists of two pupils, two parents, management of the school, the social, personal and health education, SPHE, teacher, the guidance counsellor, and one or two other teachers or year heads if they are interested and available to take part.  That is the overarching group, which does an analysis of what each school needs in terms of mental health and identifying the difficulties.  It can then put in place measures which will help a particular school for that particular year.  It is self-evaluation in the school.  That is at one level.  At another level in the school there is a Jigsaw care team.  Did I mention that psychologists are on the adolescent health team as well?  On the care team, the psychologists come into the school and sit with the teachers, the guidance counsellor, the SPHE teacher and the special needs teachers.  They are able to discuss students who have particular difficulties and therefore can obtain consultation and help.  That gives the staff confidence.  We are able to work together in a professional way and therefore we can decide on the children who need to be referred outside the school or what we can do within the school to help those children.  We can bring in the entire staff in terms of making changes and observing or improving on behaviours.  It is a whole integrated approach.  The psychologist comes into the school and helps the staff.  That is what we have found.<\/p><p> When I read the guidelines I could not believe they were so close in many ways.  Jigsaw Meath proves that the guidelines will work, but only with resources.  Jigsaw Meath is currently working on goodwill.  I am working in a voluntary capacity.  The schools do not have any extra money.  Counselling will be needed more frequently because it is obvious to me that if all the staff are working with the students and identifying students who have problems, those children will need help, but the average teacher does not have time to sit down and give them an hour of their time to discuss issues.  The staff try to listen and give them time, but we need more counselling rather than less because the more distress one picks up in the school, the more help is required.  Before children are referred out, we need proper evaluations and counselling within the school to see if a student can be helped in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032700009#K01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Annette Clarke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364393400,"counter":81,"content":"<p>Ms Leydon was asked specifically about the mental health issues in the teaching body, and Ms Clarke was asked about the area-based approach and the strategy in Ballymun.

That is quite an issue that is emerging, but I will take the latter part last.<\/p><p>  I am very familiar with the work Jigsaw does, but every time I listen to its representatives I continue to be impressed in that we do have solutions to problems.  The members are practical people.  They are legislators, and they want solutions.  They do not want a critique of what is wrong but to get good guidance on what might work from people like us who are on the ground.  Capacity is extremely problematic.  Putting on my ASTI hat, this day next week at our conference we will launch the third survey in a row of cutbacks in schools.  Schools have an average loss of 2.1 subject teachers.  To put that in context, as every subject teacher covers 33 children, if a school loses two teachers, 66 children have to be sorted out.  Those 66 children cannot be parked during the day.  They have to be dealt with, and our survey will show how that can be done.  What I am saying is that the entire thrust of the guidelines is the whole-school approach, but when we have loss of capacity whereby teaching staff are removed from the school, the capacity is severely impaired.<\/p><p>  The first message I would give members as legislators is that they must  protect the funding for education.  It is essential that in the next budget funding for education is not reduced in any way.  I would always make the case that it should be enhanced, but it must be protected because if schools lose another teacher, they will be at their wits' end.  They are at their wits' end already in terms of providing the curriculum, not to mention implementing these profound approaches to societal problems such as well-being.<\/p><p>  Regarding the other suggestion I would make, I was interested to hear Senator Moran mention funding for third level.  That is something on which the committee should pick up.  In the coming year, the Teaching Council, the regulatory body for the teaching profession, will introduce a framework for continuing professional development, CPD.  What that means is that there will be mandatory upskilling for teachers on an annual basis.  What constitutes upskilling will be worked out, but there will be a huge demand for the relevant courses to be made available to those in the profession.  One of the problems currently is that apart from the SPHE support service, which does not get enough funding anyway, there is not much alternative training.  <\/p><p>  I suggest that members work to protect the budget for education, make sure the third level institutions get funding to allow them provide courses to upskill teachers, and be aware that online training is not sufficient.  It must be backed up by face-to-face peer coaching and mentoring.<\/p><p>  The other practical point raised by Deputy Butler, a fellow Trim citizen, was that board of management training is critical.  The ASTI had discussions with the departmental team and it is putting together the guidelines.  Regardless of the initiative we examine in schools, the Achilles heel of those initiatives is the board of management.  The Department is quick to say we have autonomous boards of management which are ultimately accountable, but sometimes they are the people who know least about what is supposed to be happening and do not have the required skills.  They have a lot of goodwill and community and other expertise, but they do not know the ins and outs of these matters.  Speaking practically, the members should say that in the education budget the management bodies should be given money to provide training for boards of management.  That is critical.<\/p><p>  I am conscious that other people wish to speak, but I want to make a final point.  There are positives.  We have a big reform agenda in education.  It is not easy for teachers.  There are dimensions of it with which the ASTI in particular would have issues, but it is a reform agenda that is creating capacity for these type of changes.  For example, we now have school self-evaluation, and the Department must be commended on taking a \"slowly, slowly\" approach rather than a stick-based accountability approach.  Over time, school self-evaluation will develop schools' capacity for self-reflection in terms of asking how they are doing and whether they are doing something well, which was mentioned earlier in respect of the excellent school with which I am very familiar.  It is about bringing all those people together and being able to do things in a coherent fashion.  The school self-evaluation measures will support that.<\/p><p>  We must be positive.  It is the members' job as legislators to help bring this country back to some degree of decency of lifestyle and prosperity.  It is important that we give people positive messages about what they can do, but the most important aspect is to protect the capacity of schools to do what they are doing and to ensure further cuts are not imposed.  That is the fundamental message.<\/p> <p> With regard to the question on teachers' mental health, I am always reluctant to talk about this because teachers are leaders and professionals whose job it is to care for children.  However, there are incredible stresses, including financial, on teachers these days.  A teacher to whom I spoke yesterday told me that while she would like to upskill and do a master's she cannot afford to do so because her husband is unemployed and one of her children is currently at college.  These are the type of stresses about which I am sure members are hearing at their constituency offices.  We are lucky in Ireland in that we have an incredibly dedicated teaching force at primary and secondary levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032700010#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira Leydon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364394000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032700011#M00200","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1364394000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Excuse me, I asked a direct question which was not answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032700011#M00300","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1364394000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I will come back to the Senator when Ms McClorey has responded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032700011#M00400","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1364394000,"counter":87,"content":"<p>There is no point asking questions if they are not going to be answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032700011#M00500","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1364394000,"counter":88,"content":"<p>We agreed earlier to finish this section at 3 p.m.  There are people outside who have been waiting two hours to come in.

Well-being in post primary schools will be built on the well-being of children coming into that sector.  One cannot separate out a child of 12 or 13 years moving to second level and expect his or her well-being to be any better than it is as they cross that threshold.  <\/p><p>  Much of the focus of Young Ballymun has been on developing two key strategies, one of which is an infant mental health strategy in partnership with the HSE and CAMHS for children 0-3 years and their parents.  The notion of inviting health officials to address the committee is interesting.  This issue is hugely relevant for children and families.  As we all know, the intersection between health and education is artificial at family or child level.  These services are all integrated around the child and the family.  One might ask why the 0-3 years period is critical to secondary school.  Parental attachment, attunement processes and the pre-language development, brain development and social and emotional competences of a young child provide the foundation for the development of every other effort of the child, his or her parents and the teachers and community organisations around them.  This is intimately connected with the issues confronting secondary schools and the strategies required to be designed to respond to them.<\/p><p>  On our implementation of the Incredible Years programme across primary schools in Ballymun, the independent evaluation is available on our website.  There have been two key outcomes, namely, parental depression and stress levels reduced significantly from levels of clinical concern to within normal mental health boundaries and, for children, there were significantly increased pro-social behaviours and a marked decrease in hyperactivity combined with decreases in emotional and conduct problems.  As those members who were formerly teachers will know all of these gains for children and parents are intrinsically linked to their educational attainment.  Also important is parental well-being and the ability, confidence and competence to manage the secondary school development of one's child.  As a parent who has completed that journey I know that building an effective relationship with one's child in adolescence is difficult.  It is a time when naturally parent-child and young person-teacher communications can be strained and complex but is a normal pathway of development.  The strength or otherwise of the bonds, attachments and communications that we developed with our children in their much earlier stages of development carries most of us through to adulthood.<\/p><p>  The role of the parent in whole-school strategies is also important.  The World Health Organization whole-school approach also underpinned our work with primary schools in Ballymun.  Parents are a key element of a whole-school approach.  Building the competence and capacities of teachers is also essential.  Children's self-regulatory, self-expressive and self-awareness capacities are at the core of mental health and well-being.  Parents can be so easily left out of this loop from birth onwards.  It can all be about the child or other people.  The parent is the primary promoter and protector of the child's welfare and mental health and development.  Investing in parental awareness skills, knowledge and understanding is important.<\/p><p>  I was struck by Deputy Butler's observation in regard to his role on the school management committee in certain situations.  I identify with that.  I am sure members will identify with parents being traumatised by their inability to respond to their children's needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032700011#M00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Eleanor McClorey"},{"type":"speech","time":1364394000,"counter":90,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Jim Daly, followed by Senator Moloney.

This has very important implications for competitiveness, jobs, economic performance, Exchequer finances as well as for the well-being and life satisfaction of MSD sufferers.  The potential savings arising from the coherent programme which we will outline are of the order of &euro;250 million, therefore this is not trivial.  This is in the same ballpark as the estimate for the local property tax this year.  We are concerned here with an issue that is potentially extremely important.  That estimate does not include all the personal and economic benefits that would accrue from people with MSDs who, unfortunately, in many instances find themselves out of the workforce far too early and the benefits that would accrue to them if they were able to remain in the workforce.

In the interests of time I have left some of the slides to the background.  Ireland is one of 24 countries that took part in a survey that looked at musculoskeletal diseases, following which we formed a coalition of key stakeholders and interested parties.  At the back of the slides members will see that we have assembled some key stakeholders from various sectors, physicians and allied help professionals such as the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, employers represented by IBEC, employees represented by ICTU, health insurers, HSE as policy makers and patient groups.  We have a good broad representation.  This is not a disability lobby.  We are not here to plea to save HSE money, but to present a solution to a significant problem which will save the Exchequer significant funds and we are seeking a champion within the House to take this on.  We are calling for support to establish a cross-departmental group to work with the coalition on this issue.  Dr. Thornhill outlined the potential savings, a sum of &euro;250 million.<\/p> <p>That is one third of the total bill the Minister pays out in illness benefit every year.  In fact, if we put in place a solution for MSDs, we would also address every other illness.  Therefore, the potential pot at issue is bigger and the amount paid out each year could be up to &euro;940 million.<\/p><p> I will take the committee through the report findings.  One significant finding is that MSDs are the most commonly reported cause of work-related ill-health in Ireland.  The total cost to the Exchequer is &euro;750 million per year or 7 million lost working days per annum.  Of the figure of &euro;750 million, more than &euro;250 million is spent on illness benefit - that is to say, almost one third of the bill is spent on illness benefit related to MSDs.  The condition accounts for twice the number of days lost through stress.  We know from our research that 25% of people with rheumatoid arthritis stop work within five years of the first symptoms.<\/p><p> There is critical data indicating the prevalence of MSDs as a significant issue.  The average duration of illness benefit payment is 11 weeks, but for MSDs the duration is twice that, at 22 weeks.  We also know that one third of all recipients of illness benefit payments migrate to long-term disability benefit payment, which is another pot of &euro;640 million.  It is fair to conclude that MSDs must be a part of that figure of &euro;640 million.  At this stage, the committee will be beginning to understand the significant savings that could be achieved by addressing this issue.<\/p><p> According to the Institute of Public Health in Ireland, 12% of all adults have been clinically diagnosed with a MSD and that figure will rise to 13% in the coming ten years.  Interestingly, when we compare Ireland with the other 23 countries that took part in the research, we find our contribution or our bill relating to illness benefit is 30% of the total, whereas in the rest of Europe it is 50%.  I suggest we have a window of opportunity if we act now.  Currently, we have no national policy on intervention or integration between the health services, employer and employee.  If we simply address this issue there are potential savings, and not only for the Exchequer.  This is an investment for the employer and it is also an investment in the well-being of the employee.<\/p><p> The report recommendations call for early and proactive intervention by the employer but also by a case manager.  My colleague, Dr. Robert Ryan, will go into this in more detail.  The ethos of what we are discussing is a focus on the capacity of the employee and not on incapacity.  With that in mind, we advocate considering a phased return to work.  We are also keen to address imaginative job design, which is central to rehabilitation.  This relates to the physical layout of workstations, flexible working times and so on.  We are also calling for health professionals to consider work as a clinical outcome.  This means they should consider the patient before them as an employee who may wish to and have to return to work.  The idea is to consider how quickly the patient can get back to work as a clinical outcome.<\/p><p> There are plenty of case histories showing the benefit of early intervention and why it works.  Most of the data is from outside Ireland but there are some Irish examples as well, which we will go into.  Generally, most companies in our research have absenteeism rates of less than 3%.  The IBEC report gives a rate of between 1.6% and 3.7%, and the public sector rates run on average at 4.9%, but with some sites reporting absenteeism of 7% across large employee bases.  Given the significant employee numbers at issue, even a 1% reduction in absenteeism could have a significant impact on illness benefit payments, which are a cost to the Exchequer.  It would have a significant effect on employer productivity and, naturally, on employee well-being.  I will leave most of the examples to my colleague, Dr. Robert Ryan.  There are some significant examples to show why we should do this quickly.  I will hand the committee over to Professor Oliver FitzGerald, who will go through a short piece on MSDs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032700012#N01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Church","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364395200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>What are MSDs?  MSDs include, most commonly, regional musculoskeletal pain.  The patients who present are people who complain of back pain, work-related upper limb disorders and hip and knee pain.  It is remarkably common, with virtually all people experiencing an episode of musculoskeletal pain during their lifetime.  The second commonest condition is osteoarthritis, which is estimated to affect more than 500,000 people in Ireland.  This is followed by rheumatoid arthritis, a condition the committee will have heard of.  It is a severe deforming arthropathy that affects up to 40,000 people in the country.  Children can be affected by arthritis and an estimated 1,000 children are affected in Ireland.  Finally, spondyloarthropathy is a group of disorders commonly involving the spine and the joints outside the spine.  It includes conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis.<\/p><p>  Broadly speaking, these are the diseases under discussion and, in each case, early intervention is central.  Early intervention has been shown to result in better health outcomes, prevention of joint damage and preservation of function, including ability to work.  It has been shown that the longer a patient is out of work with a MSD, the less likely he will be able to return to work.  For example, if a person is out of work with back pain for more than a year, the chances of his returning to work are negligible.<\/p><p>  Many of these patients are referred to rheumatology and orthopaedic outpatient services.  Unfortunately, there are lengthy waiting lists for such services throughout the country.  The waiting list is up to three years in some units, and many of these people are sitting on waiting lists.  Last year, the HSE rheumatology and orthopaedic programmes appointed 24 highly trained specialist musculoskeletal physiotherapists.  During 2012 more than 10,000 patients with regional musculoskeletal pain were seen by these physiotherapists and diagnosed and treated.  Fewer than 20% of those patients needed to see a consultant - they could be managed effectively by the physiotherapist - and fewer than 10% required surgical intervention.  We estimate that in 2013 a further 24,000 patients will be removed from the orthopaedic and rheumatology outpatient waiting lists.  In time we expect that the rheumatology and orthopaedic outpatient waiting lists will become more manageable and that physiotherapists will be able to work more at the interface between primary and secondary care.  This will allow us to address some of the issues related to regional musculoskeletal pain in a more expedient manner.  Across the spectrum of health in both primary and secondary care, we need to target getting back to work as a clinical outcome.  That is something we need to focus on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032700013#O00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Oliver FitzGerald"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364395200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I am a working occupational physician.  I see cases in which these medical problems arise in employment and I am involved in managing them.  My task in this case was to determine whether there were examples in my practice that might give a tangible sense to committee members of the potential outcomes.  In a general sense we are looking at better health outcomes for employees, but part of the process will involve an earlier return to work and substantial cost savings.  I have referenced several examples to demonstrate our point.<\/p><p>  Our role with the Dublin Airport Authority included work on an absence management programme and an early intervention programme for musculoskeletal injuries.  The idea was that we would see staff members at an early opportunity when they became unwell.  The programme resulted in a 25% reduction in overall absence and a 62% reduction in long-term absences, which were rather significant savings.  Another project that allowed us to monitor the effect of intervention by an occupational health service involved the Department of Education and Skills.  We introduced the first national occupational health service for teachers and special needs assistants.  A review at the end of the first period indicated that levels of absence due to sickness had been reduced by 17% - that is, by 70,000 teacher days per annum.  This benefit represented a 12-fold return on the cost of the service merely through a reduction in substitute teaching costs and without counting any other benefits that might accrue.  In the next phase of our project with the Department of Education and Skills, the referral point will come down from 12 weeks to four weeks.  We have introduced a team of case managers who make contact with teachers and special needs assistants who are out of work and assist them in managing the condition as well as assisting the school in managing their medical complaints and absences.  My expectation is that the reduction in absence we realised in the first phase of the service will be augmented by our earlier intervention.<\/p> <p> A well-documented example outside our jurisdiction is that of the Royal Mail in the UK, which introduced more active management not only of MSDs but of all health-related issues that resulted in work absence.  Over a three-year period, its level of absence decreased from 7% to 4.5%, resulting in savings of &pound;270 million against an outlay of &pound;46 million.  There are examples that demonstrate that early intervention using occupational health measures not only is good for the employees but should result in significant savings for the employer and perhaps the State.<\/p><p> The solution is to introduce nationally agreed standards for early intervention, developed by the Fit for Work coalition, under the auspices of the HSE.  Ideally, intervention should be carried out as early as possible, perhaps as early as day five, by an occupational health team.  The best way to achieve this is to establish a national case management system to facilitate early intervention.  Large companies may be able to resource that within their existing occupational health services, but smaller companies should have access to outsourced case management services.  The case manager is the link between the employee, the employer and the health professionals providing care to the individual.  We also propose that we need a dialogue with general practitioners and to develop guidelines with the Irish College of General Practitioners in the area of sick certification to extend the usefulness of this and its role within the terms of rehabilitation and return to work.  The coalition believes that a cross-departmental approach is necessary to implement the Fit for Work programme, and it is suggested that a high-level appointment would allow policy to be effected at a national level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032700013#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Robert Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364395800,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I am quite stunned by the figures Dr. Ryan has cited.

I have suffered from various muscular problems throughout my life.  In respect of early intervention, it is very difficult for a GP or physiotherapist to diagnose the problem at the start and to get a picture of it.  When I was X-rayed I was told I had a virus.  I had muscular problems in my legs.  I now have a touch of arthritis in my hip, which will have to be replaced.  At times I was very frustrated because the physiotherapy did not work.  Then I had a problem in my back and went to a chiropractor, who sorted out my back up to a point.  When I was told I had fallen arches, I spent a lot of money buying special shoes and getting physiotherapy for that problem, which was a total waste of time.  I am sceptical about the suggestion that it is possible to come up with a national solution to the problem, because it is a long road and many problems will arise.  The real problem is getting the final diagnosis.  One will find out only by trial and error.

Speaking on Second Stage, the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, said \"It is fair to say concerns have never been raised about the integrity, probity or ethos of our lottery\".  He also said: \"The national lottery, an crannchur n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta, has been one of Ireland's success stories of the past quarter of a century\" and \"During the past quarter of a century the Irish national lottery has come to be regarded as very innovative and successful\".  I view the legislation as a fundamental and radical change in the ethos of the national lottery.  Some have expressed their opposition to the Bill by saying that the Minister is selling off the lottery.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge he is not doing that but to all intents and purposes he is moving the lottery to a private, for profit model.  I am against that and the comments he made when we discussed this legislation previously regarding the merits of the current system and, indeed, the success of the lottery as it currently exists, raise the obvious question of why is he trying to fix it if it is not broken.  Many areas of our system of public administration require radical change but the national lottery is not one of them.  In moving this amendment I state my fundamental objection to the shift he is proposing to make.  I do not believe it will be in the public interest in the long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700002#A00600","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364392800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I utterly oppose this Bill and the mood that lies behind it.  It is wrong to sell State assets in general.  Why would we give away an asset, particularly at a time when the State and the economy are in such difficulties?  The national lottery has generated enormous revenues for the State over many years and it has supported a wide range of good causes.  I see no justification for changing something that has worked so well.  The only justification the Government has provided, aside from the real motive of further the asset stripping of this country under the austerity programme, is that the money we get upfront might allow us to fund the new children's hospital.  I do not accept that argument for one minute.  Just over one year's average revenue from the lottery would pay for the hospital.  Clearly we would not take an entire year's revenue but &euro;50 million per year could easily be earmarked from the money allocated to good causes under the current model.  Spread over five years, that would cover the cost of the new hospital.  There is no need to do what the Minister proposes in order to finance the children's hospital from lottery money.<\/p><p>  It is in effect a giveaway that will change the entire dynamic.  Camelot or whichever entity buys it will not be interested unless it can benefit from the transaction.  In moving from a set fee structure to a profit line for an entity such as Camelot, the citizens and people who buy lottery tickets and the good causes they finance will be the losers.  An Post will also be a loser.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700003#B00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1364392800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for facilitating today's discussion.  I do not think any other proposal has received the same scrutiny as this initiative to date.  We have had debates, questions and numerous motions in both Houses on the issue.  I welcome that because it is important that we rigorously consider all proposals.  I strongly reaffirm the views I expressed on Second Stage on the national lottery as it has been run for a long time.  It was interesting to read the older debates, in which grave concerns were expressed about what the original licence for the lotto would do.  Most of those fears, concerns and opposition were proven over time to be unfounded.  It was a good initiative which provided billions of euro for good causes.  Like all good ideas, however, it is not stuck in aspic.  We have to revisit it in terms of the requirements of our times.  These are unprecedented economic times and we have to look at every asset and initiative we have as a State to see how we can contribute to the reconstruction of our economy and providing for the needs of today's people.  I have no doubt that many of the concerns expressed are genuinely felt by Members of both Houses, and I have said that repeatedly.<\/p><p>  To deal with the specifics of the matter, we live in extraordinarily challenging economic times.  The licence is due to be renegotiated and retendered anyway.  There is no escaping that.  This is not a decision I made arbitrarily.  We need to tender for the licence in the normal way.  I have heard views expressed to the effect that we should almost fix who should get it, although nobody around this table has suggested that.  We cannot do that.  We have to tender and we will see how much interest is expressed in running the lottery in future.<\/p><p>  An idea I have advanced and which the Government supports is to use the opportunity of issuing a new licence to seek a significant upfront payment.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is wrong to suggest it is being given away.  It is quite the reverse.  We want to get a significant upfront payment that will enable us to invest a big chunk of it in building the new national children's hospital.  When I was setting out the multiannual capital programme, I had to find a significant amount of money for the health area.  One of the decisions I made was to preserve the capital expenditure profile for health because we need to refurbish our hospitals and provide new emergency departments and health centres in order to change the focus from acute care to primary health care.  We are going to do that as well as providing the new children's hospital as the flagship project of this Administration in terms of capital works.  It is a good idea to ring fence a tranche of money for that project.  I disagree with the view expressed by Deputy Boyd Barrett that we should simply raid the income stream of the current lotto and take &euro;50 million away from sports, the arts and all the other good causes that currently receive money in order to invest in the children's hospital.  That is a point of view that I have encountered elsewhere.  If we could both maintain the flow of money to good causes and build the children's hospital by being innovative and creative, that would be a good and proper thing.<\/p><p>  There are people who are against change.  I have found that to be the case since my new Department was created as a Department of reform.  We are an extraordinary people to be resistant to reform.  Everybody is in favour of the concept but regard the subject of reform to be somebody or something else.  We should have an open mind and a proper debate and analysis.  This new licensing regime will give a 20-year horizon to the successful bidder.  It sets up an entirely new structure of regulation because an independent regulator will determine all the issues that are important in terms of integrity, probity and ethos.  The amendments I have tabled on Committee Stage provide for the long-term sustainability of the national lottery in order to protect its integrity even beyond the term of the licence.<\/p><p>  From my discussions with the Minister for Justice and Equality I also realise we need to set out a view on regulating gambling in any event.  The lotto has been a good and careful mechanism for gambling but a significant amount of gambling is now migrating online, where we have little control over it.  The Minister is anxious that the proposed new regulator will migrate from having responsibility for the lotto to regulating gambling in general, including protecting online gambling in respect of underage people or over exposure. <\/p> <p>These are challenging issues in an age of technology but are the type of issues with which we need to grapple. While I fully acknowledge the concerns expressed by people in terms of this new departure, objectively it is the right way to go.  The proposal has been carefully crafted and balanced, will have a good impact, will provide an up-front payment for the children's hospital, protect an income stream for good causes and, hopefully, grow an income stream beyond what is a diminishing one.  I should point out that all products like this need refreshment.  Some of our problems over the past number of years are partly related to economic downturn.

The more I listen to the Minister the more convinced I am of my view.  We were all aware that the licence was due for renewal and that it was necessary to go through that procedure.  However, the Minister is availing of this as an opportunity to fundamentally change the model of the national lottery.  We will discuss the regulator at a later stage in this debate.  The fact that the Minister has been removed from the equation and a regulator is being introduced underscores yet again the private for profit nature of the new lottery model being advanced.  While according to this Government tough or challenging economic times can be used as the rationale for anything now, the fact remains that during the quarter of a century since commencement of the national lottery there has been more than &euro;12 billion in sales, &euro;6 billion in prize money and &euro;4 billion raised for good causes.  It has been a tremendous success story, with an incredible track record.  To interfere with something so successful and try to brand that as a positive reform is wrong.  The Government should not be pretending that because the licence was up for renewal these changes had to come about.  This is an initiative of the Government's making.  It is a move from a traditional successful model, in which the Minister and the State had some control and authority, to a privatised model.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that the chances are the winner of the licence will be from outside the State.  I put it to the Minister that anybody making an upfront cash payment will not be doing so for the good of their health, rather they will do so on the basis of pragmatic decisions.  For those who take on the licence, this will be solely a commercial concern.  Each time the Minister speaks on the issue of the lottery he reaffirms the success story it has been, which begs the question why is he seeking to undermine it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700004#C01100","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1364393400,"counter":180,"content":"<p>The Minister uses the argument of economic circumstances to justify many things.  He then goes on to make the argument that this is good legislation because it will inject dynamism into the lottery for the times we are in.  The implication is that the current lottery model is getting a bit tired and could do with an injection of new life.  The amount of funds generated by the current model and the fact that it has remained broadly steady despite the catastrophic collapse in the economic and financial circumstances of this country is an indication of the resilience and strength of that model and a reason not to change it.  The excuses for doing what is proposed are spurious because what the Minister suggests he wants to achieve can be achieved by the current model.  Talk of raiding existing revenue streams to finance the children's hospital is loaded, alarmist language which seeks to deflect from the fundamental criticism we are making, namely, the national lottery is supported by the public in this country because it funds good causes.<\/p><p>  I am not a fan of gambling.  I do not believe it is particularly good to encourage it.  However, the national lottery is at least an outlet for gambling that in the greater scheme of the gambling landscape is a more benign form, the revenues from which go towards good causes which, largely, benefit the socioeconomic category that tend to be the ones spending money on lottery tickets.  I do not accept the Minister's justification for this.  The Minister suggests we can achieve both aims by privatising the lottery.  I believe we can do both by retaining it as it is.  Regardless of how the Minister spins or tries to justify this, it is privatisation.  Currently, An Post, a State-owned company, is the parent company for the lottery.  That is going to change.<\/p> <p>It is highly likely that, as a consequence, we will have Camelot or some similar outfit, which has absolutely no loyalty or allegiance to or interest in the concerns or needs of the citizens of this country, taking it over.  We will move from the payment of a set fee to the introduction of a profit line, which is what it says in the Department's statements.  Something gives there because, as Deputy McDonald said, these guys will not come in for the good of their health; they want something.  What they want is the profit line.  Something will give in a context where that profit line is introduced.  I do not see any justification for this and I utterly oppose it.  The Minister should not repeal the Act put in place to underpin the lottery as currently constituted, which is what this section is about.  It is not necessary and it will not help us in any way justify what the Minister is doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700004#C01200","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364394000,"counter":182,"content":"<p>It is always interesting to listen to Deputy Boyd Barrett.

Nobody is against the notion of building a national children's hospital, so we need to find the wherewithal to do so.  In my judgment, this is a very good way to do so.  I do not believe it does any damage to the integrity of the lottery.  In fact, we have taken great pains to lay out a structure which preserves the integrity and ethos of the lottery because, ultimately, a lottery is based on trust, and if people lose trust in it there will be no future for the lottery.<\/p><p>  I know Deputy Boyd Barrett is allergic to the idea of profit as a motive to do anything, but we sell licences.  We sold the broadband spectrum licence last year for many hundreds of millions of euro and I do not remember him attacking that.  The last time the licence was issued, it could have gone to Camelot or to anybody else.  As I indicated to the committee previously, a number of parties were interested in it, so we will see who will be successful in bidding for this.  <\/p><p>  As I said, it is our intention to safeguard the income stream for good causes.  It is in our interest to preserve a robust prize fund, and we will deal with this in some detail later on.  Deputy McDonald tabled an amendment on that issue.  All of these things, including the issue of holding on to a decent income stream for the retailers, are the balances and checks we have put into this.  <\/p><p>  The objective to defend the income stream for good causes is a good one.  The Deputies opposite are absolutely right in saying it is important that communities which depend on funding should have access to sports grants and all the things which have been funded from this income into the future.  This is a good idea.  People will be opposed to it in principle, as they were to the initial lottery, but all the checks and balances we have built into this in more than a year of thinking about it, refining it, getting expert advice on it and looking at best practices internationally will strengthen the lottery into the future.  <\/p><p>  The nature of people's access to gambling is changing as more people use online facilities and so on.

In order to allow us the time to do so, I had to take advice from the Attorney General on whether I could extend the licence, and the advice was that I could do so on the basis that there was a process in train which had been accepted.  The answer to the Chairman's question is that if the lottery licence runs out, there is no licence extant.  We could not issue a new licence without going through a competitive process.

The reason An Post has it is that it won the tender.  If we were having this debate in advance of its winning the tender in 2001, it would be exactly the same debate.  That is the way the licence is structured.  We would have to have an opening tendering mechanism.  As I indicated, Swiss Lotto was one of the organisations shortlisted on the last occasion, but it did not win the contract, which was won by An Post.  I do not know who will win the licence and I have deliberately kept a mile away from the process of tendering.  I have established a series of protocols, which are available on the Department's website, to show that.

The main sweetener in terms of the public acceptability of the sale of the national lottery licence, is the absolute commitment given by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as well as the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health that a substantial part of the proceeds from the upfront payment will go to the new children's hospital.<\/p><p>  This Bill is silent on that issue.  This is the place where we must walk the walk instead of talking the talk.  This is the Bill in which we must insert a section dealing with the funding of the new children's hospital.  Each time the Minister has spoken on this Bill, he has mentioned the national children's hospital.  If the public were satisfied that a substantial portion of the national lottery fund would be ring-fenced for the new children's hospital, many, but not everybody would say that is a good idea.  People would understand the reason for the sale of the State asset.<\/p><p>  In my amendments I propose two methods of dealing with this issue.  In amendment No. 2, I have circumscribed the limitations put on amendments submitted by Opposition Members by asking the Minister to give a report, outlining how the proceeds from the national lottery will be ring-fenced for the purpose of meeting the costs of the construction of the national children's hospital.  In the course of the Second Stage debate the Minister said he was considering this issue.  Now that we are on Committee Stage, the time for considering the use of the funds realised by the sale of the licence is now over, I would expect to hear from the Minister his commitment to do so and have it specified in legislation.  The related amendment No. 24 seeks to amend section 41, which deals with the disbursement of funds to good causes, referring in particular to sport and recreation; national culture; the Arts; health; youth and so on.  I have added \"the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital;\" to that list.  If there is any substance to the talk of the Taoiseach and other Ministers, the Minister should be able to accept these amendments. <\/p><p>  My main concern is that the main costs associated with constructing the new children's hospital will move to 2017 and 2018, depending on the environmental impact statement, planning conditions, the tendering process now that the proposed hospital on the Mater site is not now going ahead.  There could have a closer match between the receipt of the funds, when the original statement was made, if the original plan had proceeded as intended.  That has not now happened.  I do not understand the mechanism by which the Minister can hold this fund.  The Minister mentioned the G4 licences.  My understanding is that the proceeds realised by G4 last year went into central funds, they did not get ring-fenced for the development of broadband in three years time.  There is no other mechanism for the Minister to keep a couple of hundred million in the top drawer for the new children's hospital when it comes along in five years time.  I want an assurance on the legal mechanism by which the Minister can actually say, the money that well be realised by the sale of the national lottery licence in the next 12 months can be ring-fenced and held for the national children's hospital.  If it goes into the central fund it will be used to pay off the national debt at the end of the year in the end of year balance.  When we come to need the money for the new children's hospital, the money that the sale will have realised will have been paid off to the international bond holders or whoever holds the Irish national debt.<\/p><p>  Will the Minister respond to the issues I have raised?  If the Minister accepts the amendment in principle, and ringfencing the proceeds or holding the money in some other mechanism for the new children hospital, will he explain how he can do that?  I believe the Minister should hold this money, but I do not know how he can do that.<\/p><p>  The fund that the regulator will hold for good causes does not specify that funds from the sale of the licence should go into that account, as this is not specified in the Bill. <\/p> <p>I look forward to hearing the Minister's response and then I will comment further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700006#E03100","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364395200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>The Chairman is very indulgent but if I recall, the Ceann Comhairle was even more indulgent on Second Stage as we had a virtual Committee Stage debate on this point when Deputy Fleming made his contribution.  I have given my word on what I intend to do.  What we are talking about is the mechanism for doing it.  To add it as another beneficiary for good causes is not the way to go.  I do not intend it to be a good cause that can be considered.  I want it to get a big chunk of the up-front payment.  I discussed what I envisage doing with my own departmental Secretary General.  The Deputy is correct in saying that I had hoped all of this would be much more in sync, in other words that construction of the national children's hospital would start this year, but obviously the knocking of the original planning permission, the reassessment and the relocation has moved that back.  Therefore, it is likely that we will have the accrued money from the sale of this licence available in advance of the requirement to draw it down for this purpose.  The reason I mentioned the spectrum licence was that licence sales for money are not an unusual event but that did go to retire part of the national debt and it was part of the budgetary arithmetic and necessary to do that.  By Government decision and by agreement with the troika from the outset, this money, by contrast, is not going to be used for that purpose, it is available to invest in the economy.  I have always ring-fenced this money, even from other asset sales in terms of the stimulus package where the bulk of it would be used for job creation but eventually some of it would be used to retire debt.  All of this money up-front payment, or the bulk of it, will be used to invest in the economy, depending on how much we get because, obviously, I am speaking in the abstract until I see the actual sum used to invest in the national children's hospital.  It will be in some form of a ring-fenced account, the exact nature of which is being worked out.  It will, I hope, be used to acquire some interest payments until it is required to be drawn down and used to build the national children's hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700007#F00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1364395200,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I cannot accept that response.

First, the entire reasoning for this initiative is to build a national children's hospital.  That is the genesis of it.  When we were doing the public capital programme shortly after we came into office I published the public multiannual programme in November 2011.  In order to hold &euro;390 million - if I recall correctly - annual expenditure on capital for health I needed to squeeze other areas, and transport is one of the areas that was squeezed, as the Deputy will be aware.  I came in for some criticism from the Deputy's party in reducing capital spend generally but we had to squeeze, and that was the decision we made.  I have been looking for alternative ways of augmenting the public capital programme since, including moneys through the European Investment Bank and the sale of State assets generally.<\/p><p>  I was determined, as was Government, to fund the national children's hospital.  It required a very significant chunk of money and in the previous Government's structuring of it, another big chunk of the money was to come from philanthropy.  To be blunt, I was never convinced that a volume of money of the size envisaged would come from philanthropy to fund it.<\/p> <p>I wanted to be certain that we had the money and that it was in place.  I wanted to be able to say to the people with an honest heart that this would be built.  In fairness to my Department, we examined all possible avenues and the availability of the licence money and how to structure it in a given way if an upfront payment presented itself.  I presented that to Government and there has been a formal Government decision &ndash; it does not depend on my being in Government &ndash; to expend a significant sum of the proceeds of the upfront payment on the national children's hospital and that is what we intend to do.<\/p><p> It is not appropriate to tie that into this legislation.  This is the advice I have received from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, but I am giving my commitment that this is what the Government intends and this is what I intend.  How is it do be done?  Initially it was not as challenging an issue because we could allocate it immediately to the Department of Health capital Vote because we would have used it immediately.  However, since that is not going to happen we must put it somewhere on hold.  It could be placed in an escrow account or a ring-fenced account within the NTMA family.  To put it bluntly, I do not want it mixed with other money, I want to see it clear and true to be honest and faithful to the people in the commitments I have made.  That is what we will devise.<\/p><p> I have no wish to report within one month, because within one month of enactment I will not know how much money I have.  Only when we conclude the sale will we know the volume of money and whether I have enough to build the hospital, whether I have a significant surplus or what the story will be.  However, I would be happy to give a commitment to the committee and the Chairman, once the national lottery licence is sold, placed and taken up, to come back and explain exactly what to do with the money, and to take advices on that and bring in the NTMA and whoever else the committee wishes to discuss it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700007#F02500","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364395800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I will come back to Deputy Fleming.

Therefore, it is entirely reasonable for the Minister to indicate the manner by which he would hold and ring-fence these moneys.  The Minister is clear in his mind that he must do so.  I recall this was raised and debated extensively on Second Stage.

I believe I have answered Deputy Fleming's questions and I have told the committee of the mechanism that I intend to pursue.  I will not be in a position to come back within one month of the enactment of the legislation because by then we will not have the licence floated, we will not know who is interested and we will not have the deal done.  Until we have that I will not be in a position to know the quantum of money I have.  I will happily come back later and I have an open mind on it.  I realise Deputy Fleming in particular is interested in the issue.  Others might have a view as well but I have no wish to put it somewhere that does not accrue the best money.  We are short of resources at the moment.  Deputies might have ideas in that regard and I am willing to listen to them.  However, I guarantee that it is my intention to have a significant sum of money, sufficient to build the national children's hospital, ring-fenced for that purpose.  That is as much as I need to say about it.<\/p><p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked a general question about my dealings with the troika.  I have no wish to open a row with Deputy Fleming, who may have a point of contention in this regard.  However, from the outset, the troika conveyed to us the understanding it had with the previous Administration that there was to be a significant sale of State assets and all moneys from the sale of State assets was to be used to pay down debt <i>simpliciter<\/i>.  We engaged with the troika on the basis that this was unacceptable.  We stated we would sell up to &euro;3 billion of State assets excluding the national lottery.  That was to be ring-fenced separately and was never put into this process.  Following the initial argument we had and won we agreed half of the money was to be re-invested in job creation and the other half used to write down debt.<\/p><p>  I re-engaged after that because one of the problems that arose especially in securing public private partnerships was back-stop money.  To secure money from the European Investment Bank we needed to have a backstop from an Irish bank in normal circumstances.  However, the governance structure of the European Investment Bank and other similar funding agencies require the backstop to be a AAA-rated resource of money.  Of course the Irish banks were not AAA-rated.  Other countries used some other resources.  Some countries have used Cohesion Fund resources as the backstop to draw down European Investment Bank money.<\/p><p>  I posited that we could use some of the resources of the sale of State assets to back-stop money that we could invest in job creation here and that was accepted.  That is how the bulk of moneys from State assets sales will be treated, for example, in the case of the generating elements of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and probably some of the offshore generating capacity of ESB.  However, we have always treated this licence separately and not as a State asset.  That is why I have made the distinction.  This was always a specific and unique proposal to find the capital wherewithal to build the national children's hospital and that is what I intend it to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700008#G01200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1364395800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I fully understand that the Minister cannot put a figure on what might come through.

It is immaterial whether it is by the NTMA or held by the national lottery regulator.<\/p> <p>I am not saying the Minister wants to do that but I am trying to give him alternatives.  He could tell the public as part of the discussion on Committee Stage that a fund will be open.  Another possibility arises from the Minister's mention of the troika's being in town next month.  After each visit a revised memorandum of understanding is issued with a few small changes that have been agreed.  There could be a sentence in that about the national lottery licence to which the Government has signed up and the troika, being the IMF, the EU and the ECB, could note the Government's decision that a portion of these proceeds will be in a designated account for the future construction of the national children's hospital.

A regulator is needed where one was not needed before.  A separate body is required because whereas the Minister was previously a shareholder of the national lottery, he will not be under the new regime.  That is proof that this is privatisation.  One considers the experience of two sectors where regulators failed disastrously.  The Financial Regulator failed utterly to deal with a deregulated financial services and banking sector.  When concerns were expressed about the liberalisation and deregulation of the banking sector, great assurances were given by the Governments of the day that the Financial Regulator was keeping an eye on things.  The Financial Regulator, however, went native and failed completely to rein in the vultures and the financial and banking sector.  Another example is the Taxi Regulator.  The deregulation of the taxi industry has been an utter disaster.  The Taxi Regulator, as any taxi driver will tell one, has failed catastrophically to deal with the consequences of the deregulation of the taxi sector.  Both cases represent examples of neoliberalism gone mad, but here we have it again.<\/p><p>  It is sad that we should be doing this.  It is indicative of the fact that the lottery is being privatised that there is a need for a regulator.  It is more than likely that we will have another useless quango that is supposed to rein in what is likely to be a big push to expand online gambling by whatever private operator takes over.  Judging by the past experience of regulators, we should not expect too much from the new regulator.  It is another reason the Minister should retain direct control whereby whoever holds his office is accountable at some level to the public and the Oireachtas.

I oppose every section related to the establishment of that quango.  The Government has made a great play of cutting the number of State agencies.  Specifically, the legislation provides for the Minister to perform the functions of the regulator on certain occasions.  There is, therefore, nothing in the Bill that prevents the Minister from being the regulator.  I do not see why the Minister needs to establish a new State agency to carry out functions the legislation provides that the Minister can carry out any time there is a vacancy in the office or in other circumstances.  The Minister says the last national lottery licence was issued in 2000.  The Minister has said himself that the national lottery is held in high esteem and has been operated in a way that is above board and above reproach.  The licences were previously given out by the Minister who oversaw the competition for them.  He did not need a new quango.  It is the fashion in public administration in Europe at the moment to set up a regulator every time one wants to do something new when it is the line Department that should be doing it.  There was no problem when previous licences were issued and Ministers were the people who approved them.  An Post won the licence then and I cannot see what has changed in the meantime.<\/p><p>  The Minister issued a public service reform plan document on 17 November 2011 in which a great deal of fanfare was made about a lot of things which the Minister has never followed through on.

Some fair comments were made about regulatory failures in the past.  I would not always blame the regulator, however.  Some regulators are so hamstrung by overt Government policy that they are not intended to be an authoritative regulator.  There was a deliberate policy decision by the previous administration which examined in a formal commission a structure of financial regulation and decided that light-touch regulation was appropriate.  It is not fair to blame a light-touch regulator if his mandate was to have a light touch.  The general view after that failure is that we need proper regulation.  Bluntly, that should not be done at political level.  It should be done at an accountable, regulatory level as is effectively done in other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>  I understand Deputy Sean Fleming's point on the general position I set out in the 2011 document.  We have made substantial progress on amalgamations and subsumptions in respect of 48 different bodies in 2012 alone.  We are working on a range of further bodies now.  There will be instances, however, where we must create new bodies.  There was a period in which every issue was dealt with by establishing a new agency.  Often, it suited Departments to do things at arm's length.  Where possible, that should be re-integrated back to Departments.  That has certainly been the Government's strategy.  For new bodies which have a particular purpose, a sunset clause is appropriate.  A regulator is a different kind of entity.  As long as the business to be regulated exists, the regulator should be in place<\/p> <p>In regard to the general point made by Deputy Boyd Barrett that somehow this is a sell-off or a privatisation, this is a lease of a licence that will revert entirely back to the State when the term of the lease is over.<\/p><p> It is not a sell-off in that sense at all.  In regard to the Chairman's question on gambling, the issue of gambling is evolving and it is causing significant concern.  The Department of Justice and Equality is preparing substantial overarching legislation on gambling.  When we discussed in Cabinet the need to provide for a regulator for the lotto, the synergies in this regard were self-evident.  Although it is clear that legislation will first have to emerge from the latter Department and I do not want to pre-empt that work, the Minister and I share the view that one regulator should in due course have a responsibility not only for the lotto but also for gambling in general.  That may evolve when the new legislation is introduced.<\/p><p> There will be no charge to the State because the regulator will be funded from lotto income.  We will deal with the specifics of the funding in subsequent amendments because Deputy Fleming made several salient points in this regard on Second Stage.<\/p><p> In regard to accountability, section 22 of the Bill as published makes the regulator fully accountable to the Oireachtas by virtue of annual reports and being called to give account before this committee or whatever committee is appropriate.  That is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700010#J00700","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364397600,"counter":308,"content":"<p>This Bill establishes the office of the regulator of the national lottery.

I accept there are instances in which new agencies are required and his own document specifically notes that legislation creating new State bodies will have to include sunset clauses.  However, he is now offering a more nuanced position by stating that it will not apply to regulators.  Who else will be exempted from the sunset clause?  I do not believe he has previously indicated that he would provide for exemptions from the clause.

However, they were also not simply due to policies or light touch regulation.  There was a deliberate policy of deregulation of the financial sector.  That was not only the cavalier attitude of the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy.  A general policy of deregulation and privatisation was favoured or dominant in a range of sectors.  I put it to the Minister that it is not possible to deny he is committing an act of deregulation and privatisation if he is moving from a situation in which he is the regulator and shareholder in the national lottery, alongside a State company as the other shareholder, to one where a body at one remove from direct accountability becomes the regulator and the State is no longer a shareholder.  I do not see how he can sustain his argument.  The reason he sets out for a new quango is because something that was significantly under his control and subject to a degree of public accountability will now be controlled by some private and almost certainly external commercially driven entity.  This has to be controlled and regulated, particularly in a sector in which one has to be careful.  Gambling should not be allowed to run riot.  If the running riot of certain elements of the financial and banking sector caused serious problems, allowing gambling to run riot would also be potentially dangerous for society.  I am worried that the regulation will be at a further remove from political accountability, and for that reason I oppose the section and everything related to it in the Bill.<\/p><p>  Even under the current Government, how often do we get answers when we raise questions about the taxi or financial sectors?  We are told it is the regulators' job to deal with the issues arising.  The terminology used when Departments reject our parliamentary questions is that they are not in their remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700011#K00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1364397600,"counter":310,"content":"<p>Perhaps we should have regulator at committee meetings in regard to speaking about banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700011#K00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1364397600,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I am speaking directly to the issue.

I do not think I have ever been asked a question pertaining to the regulator in my current position as regulator.  I do not think a plethora of concerns will be raised regarding the operation of the lotto.  It is a good idea to bring the regulator before committees.  We are defining the regulator's role in law.  Deputy Boyd Barrett gives the impression that we will be leaving a woman or man to do his or her own thing.  If the regulator does not meet his or her responsibilities the Oireachtas has to hold him or her to account.<\/p> <p>We must, as an Oireachtas, hold him or her to account.  That is the way the checks and balances should work in the system here.  If it did not work in the past, it was not always the regulator's fault.  The Deputy has been critical of the taxi regulator with regard to the current situation in that sector.  There was a time when a taxi licence had a cash value, which ran to hundreds of thousands of euro.  The notion that the right to operate a taxi would have such a capital value was wrong.  It was also virtually impossible to get a licence for a taxi at that time and something had to be done about that situation.  I have no responsibility for the taxi sector, and I am sure the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport would be willing to answer any questions in that regard.  We have an obligation to change the terms of reference of a regulator if it is not meeting the requirements.  The same applies in this regard.<\/p><p> I believe gambling will be an issue in the future.  I am concerned about the plethora of new casinos opening in towns all over the country.  The volume of online gambling is also huge.  We seem to have no control over this and will need to have a proper discussion on the issue.  However, that comes within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who will bring forth specific legislation in that regard.  <\/p><p> I do not believe that all new bodies, whether regulatory in nature or not, are by definition defunct or inappropriate.  It is sometimes very appropriate to establish a new body to carry out a specific function.  I do not believe the regulator proposed in this legislation will be compromised because he or she will be funded by the industry.  Many regulators, as a normal part of their functioning, are so funded and are completely independent notwithstanding that.  I have made the case for this as best I can.  The regulator will be accountable to the Oireachtas.  An annual report will also be provided and can be debated by the Houses.  The regulator can also be called to appear before a committee to answer specific questions.  The system will be a very open one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700011#K00700","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364398200,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364398200,"counter":316,"content":"<p>SECTION 8<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1364398200,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I note section 8 is opposed by Deputy Fleming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700012#L00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364398200,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Question, \"That section 8 stand part of the Bill\", put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364398200,"counter":319,"content":"<p>SECTION 9<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1364398200,"counter":320,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are related and will be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700012#L00700","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1364398200,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<blockquote><br \/>In page 7, line 32, to delete &quot;and&quot;.<\/blockquote>Amendment No. 4 seeks the insertion of a comma.

Other considerations, already included in the Bill, are that the regulator must ensure the national lottery is run with due propriety and that the interests of participants in the national lottery are protected.  Amendment No. 5 provides for the addition of a third requirement, namely, that the regulator ensure the long-term sustainability of the national lottery is safeguarded.

He will remember that there was a clear commitment in the programme for Government stating that the Government would amend the rules to ensure that no senior public servant, including a political appointee or Minister, could work in the private sector in any area involving potential conflict of interest with his or her former area of public employment until at least two years had elapsed after he or she has left the public service.

I propose he keep the commitment made in the programme for Government, that he accept my amendment and that he stay true to the two-year period, quite aside from the clearly stated commitment in the programme for Government, to maintain public confidence in the gambling and gaming industry, which is extremely socially contentious for many people and which generates levels of fear and anxiety for reasons with which I am sure we are all familiar.

I presume that when the Minister headed the Labour Party delegation in the negotiation of the programme for Government, he had reflected on these matters considerably and had sought some legal advice on the matter.  The regulator's term of office is seven years; however, there is the capacity for the person to serve a second term.  Particularly in the context of the gambling and gaming industry, it is extraordinary that the Minister would consider it appropriate that a person who had served as regulator could go into consultancy or private work in the same area after a 12-month cooling-off period.  That is not just right.  Whatever the stated cooling-off period - we are arguing the toss between one and two years - the critical element is that in the terms of the contract signed and agreed between the State and the person who will take up the position of regulator, the terms and conditions are fully expressed and understood.  One cannot compel a person to become the regulator.  A person will enter into that role of his own free will and volition.  I am astonished at the answer the Minister gave me.  Does this mean the programme for Government commitment to a two-year cooling-off period is now off the table?  Has the Minister ditched that provision as a general principle?<\/p><p>  I do not accept the Minister's point.  It displays very poor judgment, if I may say so, on his part.  What the public will hear about this legislation are clear messages on the children's hospital and the lotto, but they will not be aware that the position of regulator is intended to have a reach far beyond the national lottery and into the industry of gambling and gaming as a whole.  I do not believe for a second the Minister would have any public support for the notion that such a regulator of the gaming industry could, just 12 months after leaving the employment of the State, go into consultancy or some other private role within that industry.  I am very alarmed at that.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his position.  That should be easy enough for the Minister as, after all, he signed up to this commitment in the programme for Government.  Of all the things I have heard today, this alarms me the most.  As the Minister is responsible for reform in the public sector, he is so eager for reform that we have this new departure for the national lottery.  I think a two-year cooling-off period is by every means proportionate, and not just proportionate but absolutely necessary for public confidence in this regulatory office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700014#N00700","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1364399400,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Before I ask the Minister to reply, I have a question that needs to be clarified.

Certainly we gave this much thought, in as much as we could, during the negotiation of the programme for Government.  In the preparation for policy in advance of the programme for Government, we considered, in response to the Mahon tribunal and other recommendations, what would be a proper cooling-off period between holding office and being re-employed.  Obviously things have evolved since then, because we have published the heads of a Bill.  We have had forums and hundreds of submissions.  I am very conscious that there are people working in the public sphere who cannot be deprived of a livelihood for a protracted period.  It is a matter of judgment and a matter of balance as to what is the appropriate period.  There are no cooling-off periods now, by and large.  There is a committee that people reference.  We will probably be able to think of instances in which appointments were made or people moved into areas that would not be particularly appropriate on leaving the public service.  This is a matter we will look at in best practice when we deal with the lobbying legislation.  I do not think Deputy McDonald or anybody else can make generalisations from this until we see the general provisions of the lobbyist Bill which will be published in due course.  We will have ample time to debate them and, I hope, discuss these matters in a mature way and make rational decisions that provide for the essential balance between an issue to be addressed and a cure that is proportionate and fair to people.  We do not debar people from applying for other jobs after leaving because if we did so they would not apply for the original job, saying they could not work for two years after they left it.  Nor can we make the law subject to constitutional challenge, with people saying they are deprived of their livelihood.<\/p><p>  All we are discussing at this committee is the National Lottery Bill and, in particular, the lotto regulator.  I have indicated for the purpose of giving information that I and the Cabinet have had discussions on the potential of the role to be expanded and how it is to be expanded.  Deputy McDonald referred to the regulator as having a role in gambling.  That is a potential role.  It will require very specific legislation that will have to be debated in full measure if and when that comes, and it will be a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality.  As of now all we are talking about is a regulator to regulate the new lotto that will come to pass.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700015#O01500","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1364400000,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I have set out in a rational, factual and measured way the reason I believe a two-year cooling off period is not just appropriate but absolutely necessary.  It happens to tally precisely with the commitment given in the programme for Government.  This is a new office.  This is a new departure if the Minister is successful in bringing forward the legislation in respect of the running of the national lottery.  He has indicated clearly that the office of this regulator will in all likelihood extend beyond the lottery and into the broader gambling and gaming industry.  It is as much for the protection of the good name and standing and integrity of whomsoever might be the regulator that there should be an appropriate cooling-off period.  I do not accept the arguments around constitutional difficulties.  The cooling-off period does not represent a denial of a person's ability to find employment <i>per se<\/i>; it represents a very specific limitation on those areas of employment into which a regulator might enter, with the public interest in mind.  That is why cooling-off periods are countenanced.

It is not an inconsequential sum of money  If one considers other regulators, they probably deal with less important volumes of money.  It is important that this is dealt with in a very transparent and open way.   It will be done in accordance with the legislation.  I like the new reporting mechanism to the Oireachtas, which is something I picked up from the case made by Deputy Fleming on Second Stage.  Even if we do not travel down the road we discussed of expanding the role of the regulator to cover a broader gambling area, there will be a significant volume of work for the regulator to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700018#S00700","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1364401500,"counter":477,"content":"<p>The Minister indicated that he does not receive parliamentary questions on the current lottery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700018#S00800","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1364401500,"counter":478,"content":"<p>Seldom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700018#S00900","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1364401500,"counter":479,"content":"<p>That proves how well his Department is running it or monitoring An Post's operation of it.

Importantly, the new licence is being designed to align interests between the new operator and the State with the objective of maximising contributions to be paid to good causes over the life of the next licence.  <br \/><br \/> Therefore it is intended that good causes contributions under the new licence will be linked to a percentage of Gross Gaming Revenues (Sales less Prizes) over the period of the new licence. This will offer the new licensee greater flexibility and scope for the growth and development of lottery games and distribution channels. Growth in Good Cause Revenues will ensure contributions to Good Causes are maximised over the period of the new licence. <br \/><br \/> Our aim is to maximise the annual payment to Good Causes over the period of the new licence.  This will be determined prior to the launch of the licence competition when a number of other matters in relation to the licence structure and licence competition have been determined.  This development follows detailed engagement by our financial advisers Davy with the marketplace.  <br \/><br \/> The Government&rsquo;s aim in this process is to deliver a significant upfront payment while ensuring that the annual revenues for good causes are maximised.<\/blockquote> We are considering how to maximise the income stream to good causes.  It is a question of whether we should just fix the figure at 30% of revenue, as indicated, or whether it might be more successful to set a percentage of what we called gross gaming revenues, that is, sales minus revenue.  Our advices and the international trend suggest maximisation of the input.  There will be a different take per game.  If one sets a threshold of 30% per game, one will not have the same income stream available as would be available according to the formula I am setting out.  Some games will actually generate little enough profit, while some will generate very large profits.  We want to set an overarching figure, that is, full sales minus the prizes, which will constitute a minimum of 50%.  The remainder will be an income stream for good causes.   Our intention is that the sum will certainly not be less than that which has been available to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700020#U03500","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364403300,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I presume this is a work in progress and that the Minister has not settled on a precise formula.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700021#V00200","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1364403300,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Exactly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700021#V00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1364403300,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I take it as read that the objective is to maximise the revenue for good causes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700021#V00400","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1364403300,"counter":569,"content":"<p>It is my intention that the income stream will not be less than that which has been available to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700021#V00500","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1364403300,"counter":570,"content":"<p>The Minister will have to settle upon some formula.

It is very important that strong safeguards are put in place to stop vulnerable people falling victim to online gambling.  This is particularly so in rural Ireland due to the huge problem of isolation.  The mere act of purchasing a lottery ticket in itself is a weekly social interaction which some people may not otherwise have.  I am concerned that the provision of an online facility for the purchase of lottery tickets could have unintended negative consequences, especially in rural Ireland.  If people in isolated areas start to go online, they may not bother to buy a ticket in their local shop and would consequently not meet other people.<\/p><p>  Many shops in rural areas depend on the add-on business they get from lottery ticket sales, which makes them viable.

Looking at the horizon, God knows what will be available via the Internet in 20 years' time.  We need to proceed in this way, otherwise if we exclude Internet transactions, we will guarantee making the current lotto obsolete.  While being mindful of that, we do need countervailing proposals which is why we have a minimum number of retailers and we have maintained the retail margin.  There will still be people who, as part of their normal business, will want to buy a lotto ticket as well.

It is very proactive in looking at a whole range of measures that rural post offices, in particular, might be able to provide.  For example, as high street banks deplete and retrench, more banking will be done through local post offices.  We should also be seeking to provide a number of State services through post offices.  Some people baulked at some Garda provisions being provided, such as checking documentation.

The national lottery requires one to register and to prove one's identity and age to play.  There are weekly and monthly expenditure limits where one plays online.

While they are not a necessary part of this legislation I have agreed to his request to incorporate them.  <\/p><p><br \/>  These amendments relate to section 22 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 as applied by section 33(1) of the National Lottery Act 1986.  This Bill makes changes to the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, which changes are contained in sections 51 and 52 of the Bill as initiated.  The aim now is to group all of the changes being made to the Gaming and Lotteries Act into one section.  In this process, we lose one section from the Bill.  All the changes to the 1956 Act will now be in section 51.  Under the substance of the old section 51, the 1956 Act as enacted prohibited the advertising of lotteries.  In 1986, this position was modified by section 33(1) of the National Lottery Act 1986 which stated that the ban did not apply to lotteries held under sections 27 and 28 of the 1956 Act.  We wish to continue this approach in the current legislation when enacted.  We are repealing the 1986 Act, thereby in effect returning to the position as pertained pre-1986.  However, section 51 of this Bill as initiated restores the position to that in force since the original National Lottery Act of 1986.  <\/p><p>  The Parliamentary Counsel has recommended that we have a separate section in the 1956 Act, namely, section 22A.  The first amendment to section 52 is to preserve the effect of the now deleted section 51 which concerns the restriction of section 22 of the 1956 Act, namely, to ensure that charitable lotteries continue to be exempt from the general prohibition on the advertising of lotteries.  These amendments relate to private charitable lotteries conducted under sections 27 and 28 of the 1956 Act.  The maximum weekly prize for lotteries held under section 27 is being increased from &euro;3,000 as set down in the 1987 Act to &euro;5,000.  The maximum weekly prize fund for lotteries held under section 28 is being increased from &euro;20,000, as set down in the 2002 Act, to &euro;30,000.   These changes are being made to afford the operators of private charitable lotteries the flexibility to increase the total value of their weekly prize funds if they so wish.  <\/p><p>  As has been the case since 1986, it will remain open to the Minister for Justice and Equality to alter these levels in the future by way of regulations.  However, the new section 28A sets out for the first time the matters to be taken into consideration by that Minister in making such regulations.  This is being done to comply with recent constitutional jurisprudence regarding the amending of primary legislation by secondary legislation, which requires that the relevant factors to be considered in making such amendment be set out in primary legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013032700025#Z01900","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1364405700,"counter":702,"content":"<p>Local sports clubs that run weekly lotteries are not registered charities.

It relates to the exercise by the State of the option to adopt and apply the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346\/2000 on insolvency proceedings.  The legal basis for the Commission proposal is to be found in Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Consequent to the terms of the proposal, we have three months to exercise the option, which we share with the United Kingdom, to take part in the adoption and application of relevant measures.  We have been informed that the three-month period will expire on 10 April 2013.  Accordingly, if we are to exercise our option, it is necessary to obtain the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas before that date.<\/p><p>  Members will be familiar with the procedure on protocol measures as a large volume of proposals which attract the provisions of the protocol have come before the Oireachtas in recent years.  The proposal under consideration today is designed to revise the current EU insolvency regulation which entered into force on 31 May 2002 and to streamline cross-border insolvency proceedings whether they apply to a single company, a group of several companies or a natural person engaged in trade or professional activities or acting as a consumer.  The current EU insolvency regulation provides a framework to determine in which member state insolvency proceedings should be commenced where a debtor has assets or creditors in more than one member state.  It also provides for the EU-wide recognition of proceedings.  The regulation determines which court has jurisdiction for opening insolvency proceedings.<\/p><p>  The Commission's proposal for a revised and modernised regulation was published on 12 December 2012 and forms part of a wider response to the economic downturn being experienced across Europe.  Modernised, cross-border insolvency law to make proceedings more efficient can benefit debtors and creditors throughout the EU.  The debt crisis of the past number of years has had a direct effect on many EU citizens, their jobs and business activities.  As current President of the EU, Ireland was pleased to facilitate the political launch of the proposed regulation.  The initial discussion of the proposal took place at the informal meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council which took place in Dublin on 18 January 2013.  The Council engaged in a lengthy and constructive discussion of the proposals and their broad thrust received a very positive political welcome from Ministers.<\/p> <p>A major new focus of the regulation is that it facilitates a move away from the traditional liquidation approach to insolvency to a second chance approach for viable businesses and honest entrepreneurs in financial difficulties where cross-border insolvency proceedings are involved.  The regulation does not apply in strictly domestic insolvency proceedings.  The key features of the revised regulation include: new procedures in regard to pre-insolvency or hybrid insolvency proceedings which were not in the original scope; greater co-operation between courts and liquidators involved in cross-border main and secondary insolvency proceedings; clarification of the centre of main interest, COMI, test, to reflect European Court of Justice judgments in regard to the opening of insolvency proceedings where the location of the COMI of the debtor may be in contention; a new approach to the co-ordination of the insolvency of cross-border groups of companies; an enhanced approach to the treatment of secondary proceedings opened for the same debtor as in the primary proceedings; and the development of standard, multilingual insolvency registers so as to improve the information on and lodging of insolvency claims.<\/p><p> The Commission&rsquo;s proposal extends the scope of the regulation by revising the definition of &quot;insolvency proceedings&quot; to include the restructuring of a company at a pre-insolvency stage and permit hybrid proceedings which may leave the existing management in place as well as debt discharge and other insolvency proceedings for natural persons where these processes exist in a member state.  This is a critical and important extension of the scope of the regulation, one which we feel is a desirable objective and is in tune with Ireland&rsquo;s domestic approach to seek, where possible, to provide a mechanism to restructure potential economically viable debtors, as detailed in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.<\/p><p> The proposal also includes a new rule in respect of secondary insolvency proceedings.  The current insolvency regulation allowed secondary insolvency proceedings to be opened in a member state where the main proceedings had been opened in another member state by court in accordance with the COMI test.  However, these secondary proceedings could only be winding-up proceedings.  This stipulation has now been dropped, primarily to facilitate the second-chance approach.  It is proposed that there be a requirement on the court seized of a request to open secondary insolvency proceedings - to consult with the liquidator or the court in the main proceedings and to postpone or refuse the secondary proceedings where they are not necessary to protect the interests of local creditors.  In either postponing or refusing to open secondary proceedings, the court will have to consider what undertakings the main liquidator in the main proceedings has made to the creditors in the secondary proceedings.  These undertakings would likely be along the lines of providing at least as good a return to those creditors as they would obtain if they sought to open secondary proceedings.  There is also to be a greater requirement for co-operation and communication by the courts<b><\/b>involved in insolvency proceedings relating to two or more members of a group of companies.<\/p><p> The proposed insolvency regulation also includes a requirement for member states to establish an insolvency register available to the public containing information on the debtor and the liquidator, as well as information relating to the insolvency proceedings.  These insolvency registers are to be interconnected and accessible via the European e-justice portal.  The European Commission has been conducting a pilot project in this regard with certain member states.  <\/p><p> The Commission&rsquo;s most newsworthy proposal is, perhaps, the retention, with some modification, of the now established concept of centre of main interest, COMI.  The modifications proposed are designed to ensure that the COMI test is consistent with the body of case law from the European Court of Justice and elsewhere that has developed since 2002 in regard to the operation of the regulation.  The COMI test is now extended to private individuals or natural persons in cross-border insolvency proceedings.  There will be a duty on the court that is requested to open the insolvency proceedings to examine the COMI of the debtor and specify the ground on which the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction is decided.  Creditors from other member states will have a right to challenge the court&rsquo;s decision.  It is a matter for the court concerned to satisfy itself that the provisions in its national law in this regard have been observed.<\/p><p> In this area of jurisdiction, we must be conscious of the need to avoid abuses in this regard, often described as forum shopping or bankruptcy tourism.  At the informal EU Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting in Dublin on 18 January last, Ministers were concerned as to the need for a more uniform approach to the establishment of the centre of main interest so as to combat potential abuses.  However, on the other hand, it must be acknowledged that a company or natural person is entitled to change a COMI and could do so for a number of purposes.  This entitlement arises under the broad rubric of freedom of movement in the Internal Market and such freedom has been enforced by decisions of the European Court of Justice.  Thus, it is likely that despite our reform, we may continue to see a number of Irish people establishing a COMI in the UK, with the ultimate intention of taking advantage of the lower discharge period for bankruptcy there.  However, we have also seen in regard to several Irish applicants, some of them very notable persons, that the UK courts can and have refused to accept or have revoked jurisdiction in insolvency proceedings where an abuse has been detected.<\/p><p> As President of the Council, I have made it clear that I want to facilitate a comprehensive and intensive examination of the regulation during the Irish Presidency.  This priority is reflected in the current scheduling of eight meeting days of the relevant Council working group.  This approach is shared by my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation, whose Department is centrally involved, given its responsibility in regard to corporate insolvency.  Thus, it is important that Ireland responds positively to the proposal by exercising its right to opt into discussions on the regulation.  This will maximise our ability to influence the shape of the final outcome.  However, it should be emphasised that exercise of our opt-in does not necessarily mean that all elements of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal are acceptable.  During the continuing negotiation of the regulation, the Departments concerned will, of course, seek any necessary legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General as required.<\/p><p> By way of background, the proposal which we are discussing today has been initiated by the European Commission as part of its response to the economic downturn across Europe.  The objective of the proposed reform is to modernise cross-border insolvency law to make cross-border insolvency proceedings more efficient, benefiting debtors and creditors throughout the EU.  The new regulation is designed to give potentially viable companies and entrepreneurs a second chance before being declared insolvent and is seen as part of the justice for growth agenda.  The proposed regulation reflects a high political priority at European level to take measures aimed at creating sustainable growth and prosperity in Europe.  The economic crisis has led to an increase in the number of failing businesses across member states.  Statistics published by the European Commission in December last show that in the period from 2009 to 2011, an average of 200,000 firms per year in the EU became insolvent.  Approximately one quarter of these corporate insolvencies have a cross-border element and 50% of all new businesses do not survive the first five years.  It is estimated that 1.7 million jobs per year are lost throughout Europe due to insolvencies. <\/p><p> Growth has been put at the heart of the Commission&rsquo;s agenda on justice in line with the growth strategy Europe 2020, the annual growth survey and recently adopted Single Market Act II.  Modernising the EU&rsquo;s insolvency rules to facilitate the survival of viable businesses and to present a second chance for entrepreneurs has been identified as a key action to improve the functioning of the Internal Market and of key relevance to the justice for growth agenda on which we are focusing during the course of our Presidency.  The 2009 Stockholm programme for the European area of justice highlighted the importance of insolvency rules in supporting economic activity.  The effective handling of insolvency cases is an important issue for the European economy and sustainable growth, including for Ireland.  Ireland and all other member states will continue their own internal examination of the detail of the proposals contained in the regulation.  However, it is not yet possible to offer definitive national comments beyond our broad initial welcome of the stated objectives of bringing greater clarity to cross-border insolvencies and expanding the scope of the existing regulation.<\/p><p> The committee will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for Ireland, as current holder of the Presidency of the European Union to seek to express, on behalf of the Council and the member states, a firm opinion on the detail of the Commission proposals at this early point of the consideration of the proposal in the Council working group.  In Ireland, we have a very effective corporate restructuring mechanism introduced by the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990.  This is the examinership process, whereby a company experiencing difficulties can seek the protection of the High Court to appoint an examiner to attempt to work out a rescue approach.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, will shortly introduce proposals to allow examinership applications to be considered by the Circuit Court, so as to reduce the costs involved.  The Companies Bill, published in December 2012, contains proposals to allow small private companies access the examinership process through the Circuit Court, rather than the High Court.  The rationale for this proposal, which was included in a report by the Company Law Review Group to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in September 2012, is to reduce costs for this cohort of companies and to make the examinership process more accessible to it.<\/p><p> The group had been asked to recommend on whether a legally binding non-judicial process for commercial debt settlement was feasible.  However, it found that the Constitution requires that any compulsory write-down of debts for less than market value requires compensation for the loss, consent of the creditors or a court order whether by substantive approval of a scheme of arrangement or a right of objection to the court for dissenting creditors.<\/p><p> The revised insolvency regulation does not deal exclusively with corporate insolvency, it also updates the approach to cross-border proceedings on personal insolvency.  This is an area of the law which has recently undergone significant reform in this country and in other member states.  As members will be aware, the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012 was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 19 December 2012 and signed into law by the President on 26 December 2012.<\/p><p> The Personal Insolvency Act will be fully commenced as soon as all of the necessary preparations for administration of its provisions are finalised.  It represents the most comprehensive reform of our insolvency law and practice since the foundation of the State and is a key element of the Government's strategy to return this country to stability and economic growth.  The Act is extensive and legally complex.  It introduces new concepts to Irish law.  Indeed, the new personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, introduces a concept which I understand to be unique in international insolvency law, in providing for the negotiated resolution of secured debt in a court sanctioned process that provides certainty for creditors and, if I may say so, hope and relief for debtors.  The Act fulfils both a key commitment in the programme for Government and also a requirement of the EU-IMF-ECB programme of financial support for Ireland.  It introduces three new procedures for debt resolution which though requiring approval by the court, are essentially non-judicial in nature.  I know members have a copy of the script so I will merely mention the procedures.  These are: the debt relief notice, DRN; the debt settlement arrangement, DSA; and the personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, which we have discussed at great length and to which I referred again last night in the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p> The Act also provides for significant reform of the Bankruptcy Act 1988.  The critical change is to provide for the automatic discharge from bankruptcy, subject to certain conditions, after three years, which I believe represents a reasonable balance of the legitimate interests and expectations of both debtors and creditors.  This period is in line with the European norm in regard to insolvency proceedings.<\/p><p> The Act also provides for the establishment of a new Insolvency Service to operate the new non-judicial insolvency arrangements.  The director of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, Mr. Lorcan O'Connor, is working with all possible speed to ensure the full operation of the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 can begin as soon as possible.<\/p><p> In conclusion, the proposed EU regulation to modernise cross-border insolvency proceedings, while undoubtedly somewhat technical and legally complex in nature, is a significant proposal.  I reiterate my view that it is important that Ireland responds positively to the proposal by exercising our right to opt in to the negotiations from an early stage.  This positive signal is particularly important at a time when we are the current holders of the Presidency and have chaired the first meetings of the Council working group.<\/p><p> I hope the committee will support the motion to exercise the opt-in.  I need hardly add that any points raised by members of the committee on the European Commission proposal will be noted and will be taken into account during the negotiation process.  I look forward to any comments or questions members of the committee might have on this important matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013032700003#D00300","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364384700,"counter":737,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

We did discover in the context of some bankruptcy proceedings, that when some people went from this State to the United Kingdom that the issue of whether it was a centre of main of main interest which entitled bankruptcy proceedings to be initiated was not always comprehensively examined, nor were people, by the courts.  A court&rsquo;s capacity to examine such an issue is dependent on whether there is a challenge to the bankruptcy proceedings taking place within a particular jurisdiction.  A court that receives a submission or documentation on behalf of an individual would normally rely on the veracity of what is being said unless it is challenged.  Perhaps in the early days of the enormous difficulties being experienced in this State when some individuals went to the UK the issue was not adequately examined.  It was not challenged by individuals who might have had an interest in challenging it.  We now see that the regime is operating differently and the UK courts have delivered a number of judgments in the area.  There is now a greater focus on establishing whether there is truly jurisdiction when someone seeks bankruptcy, particularly individuals who have lived for a substantial number of years in another State.<\/p> <p> Part of the discussion on the directive is how to ensure greater uniformity in the application by domestic courts of the concept of centre of main interest.  As we do not have the final form of the directive I cannot say, hand on heart, with certainty how, at the end of the process, the impact of the directive will be interpreted.  There are certain guidelines from the European Court of Justice that apply in this area and the directive has to ensure it meets those guidelines.  Certainly the conversation relating to the directive is contributing to a uniform view at political level.  That is important for synergy between the court systems and the provisions contained in the regulation which expressly provide for greater contact between courts dealing with insolvency issues, that is, between judges in one jurisdiction and another.<\/p><p> That will contribute substantially to a greater uniformity of approach particularly in circumstances where an individual may seek to be declared bankrupt in one jurisdiction while creditors try to have him or her declared bankrupt in another jurisdiction.  We are at the early stages of proceedings but it can make an important contribution.  However, it will depend ultimately on what emerges in the final form of the regulation.  It is of huge importance that we are a party to the negotiations on the regulation.  Already four working groups have been chaired by Ireland in the context of the Presidency.  I understand that very good progress is being made within those working groups.  I expect the regulation will be discussed further at the European Council of justice Minister's meeting in June but matters will not be finalised and the discussions will continue.  It is important that Ireland not only chairs meetings up to the end of June but that we participate in the discussions to complete the final framing of the regulation after June.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013032700005#F01000","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364385300,"counter":747,"content":"<p>I appreciate that it is a European wide regulation.

Before taking the drug, he was leading a perfectly normal, healthy and happy life.  He took it in good faith and, unfortunately, the health implications for him have been absolutely disastrous.  To say that his life has been turned upside down is a complete understatement.  Every minute of every day, he is affected very adversely by the drug.<\/p><p>  Let me quote the statement of a mother whose son was also affected by the drug: <blockquote>  I am a nurse and what I will put here will be in layman's terms or basically more generalised language to make it as direct and understandable to as many people as possible.  Please read this.<br \/><br \/>  I have a son who took Accutane.  Basically, my son took the drug for two months instead of the full four but his personality changed dramatically.  He became extremely aggressive, violent and suicidal, and his entire life started going down the drain.  It is like his survival instincts had completely reversed and he could only focus on the most negative aspects of life, to the point where his physical actions were out of control and severely detrimental to him.  Paranoia led him to becoming extremely violent, verbally abusive and self-consumed, and even caused him to suffer from such disorders as agoraphobia, body dysmorphic disorder, depression and even delusions.  He closed himself off from the world, lost his career and all of his friends and pushed everyone out of his life.  As a registered nurse, I was able to realise, as he changed, where it might have come from, through research.<\/blockquote>  The nurse discovered that Accutane was originally a cancer-fighting medication.  Doctors began to realise the drug was too dangerous to give to cancer patients because losing one's mind is not an acceptable side effect to live with along with all the other severe side effects.  Most doctors stopped prescribing it.  The nurse's perspective suggests to me that the pharmaceutical company, Roche, had to make money for the development of the drug so it decided to market it under a new name.  It may have decided to do so because it noticed that cancer patients using the drug were cured of their pimples after taking the drug.  However, marketing to children with pimples a drug that is too dangerous to prescribe to people with cancer just to make money is beyond careless.  It is utterly unacceptable, despicable and cruel.  Accutane, according to the nurse, can cause severe white-matter damage in the brain.<\/p><p>  That is but one other case.  The number of suicides directly related to the use of the drug leads me to contend it is highly questionable whether it should be made available at all.  While the drug company may say a very small number of people have such an adverse reaction, one suicide is one too many.<\/p><p>  I know Mr. Jason O'Sullivan and what the drug has done to his life.  If a person were to be knocked down in the morning and killed outright, it would be a better solution than having this problem in one's head and system without being able to do anything about it.  The key point is that those who look at a person suffering from the side effects of the drug cannot see the disorder.  It is not like cancer, which may make one thin and the treatment for which makes one go bald.  The people in question look perfect.  They cannot sleep at night, however.  If they do, they are more tired when they wake up the next morning.  They are more tired than they would be if they had not gone to bed at all.  What the drug does to one's mind is absolutely frightening.  This is why I believe passionately that we should be able to do something to try to help the petitioner.  Where else can he go?  It is not as if he is looking for redress for himself.  He is not asking this in his petition.  What he is saying is that he wants the drug withdrawn.  I know from my dealings with him that he wants to stop other young people from having their lives torn asunder by taking the drug.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013032700004#V00300","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speech","time":1364400300,"counter":779,"content":"<p>I echo Deputy Healy-Rae's concerns about this case.

The committee will hold further meetings on this issue with other interested groups next month.<\/p><p>  I welcome Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy, &aacute;rd sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir of the GAA, Mr. Philip Browne, chief executive of the IRFU, and Mr. John Delaney, chief executive of the FAI.

Our response is based on these broader proposals facing us.<\/p><p>  I would like to start by underlining that the IRFU is committed, through the promotion of sport, to the development of healthy lifestyles and building communities.  Indeed, all sports are.  Rugby and rugby clubs are an integral part of the social fabric of communities across the length and breadth of this island.  They play a significant role, particularly among young people, in fostering the discipline and habit of physical activity, social interaction and the ethos of team involvement.<\/p><p>  The IRFU is more than aware of social issues surrounding alcohol misuse, including the consumption of alcohol by minors.  As I have said, we are fully committed to playing a constructive role in promoting alcohol awareness and educational programmes, and advocating the responsible use of alcohol.  With over 150,000 active playing members and over 9,000 coaches in rugby clubs and schools across the island of Ireland, we are ideally placed to assist the Department of Health to mount major educational campaigns in these communities.<\/p><p>  Issues of alcohol misuse and the need for alcohol education are not unique to Ireland and Ireland is not the first country to consider banning alcohol sponsorship in sports.  However, let us be absolutely clear on this - in countries where such bans have been introduced, no empirical evidence whatsoever exists that demonstrates a ban on sports sponsorship is effective in terms of reducing alcohol misuse.  I would also add that no coherent, evidence-based research exists linking alcohol sponsorship of sports events to alcohol misuse.<\/p><p>  As I have stated, the IRFU wishes to work with the Government on these issues.  We have recently developed a proposed awareness and education action plan, an approach to the issue of education through sport, on alcohol use and misuse.  This document has been presented to the Minister and has been circulated to this committee in advance of today's meeting.  It demonstrates the IRFU's clear commitment to putting our extensive network at the disposal of the Government to actually make a long-term impact.  I would urge this committee to recommend to the Minister and his Department that they embrace this approach of constructive co-operation, as opposed to unravelling and undermining a system which is already delivering for the health of the nation.<\/p><p>  The IRFU believes that the elimination of alcohol sponsorship from sport will simply satisfy a perceived, yet unproven, correlation between it and alcohol misuse, while delivering no concrete benefits to the community at large.  The unintended consequences of such an action will be as follows.  First, it will significantly reduce the IRFU's annual income, which will unfortunately force an immediate and drastic curtailment of the IRFU's ability to fund participation programmes for children and youths across the country.  Second, it will directly hit clubs throughout the country, many of whom are already under severe financial pressures.<\/p><p>  Third, it will be a major impediment to the IRFU's and Ireland's ability to mount a credible bid for major international rugby events, including Ireland's bid for the Rugby World Cup in 2023.  It is a potential bid but something to which we aim and aspire.  We have discussed the bid extensively with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and is well within our abilities as an island to achieve.<\/p><p>  Fourth, it will impact our ability to fund professional teams both at national and provincial levels, with the consequential loss of competitiveness which will have a negative economic impact in terms of attracting significant numbers of visitors to this country.  Furthermore, it will undoubtedly impact our ability to recruit young people into the game.<\/p><p>  Let me be absolutely clear, there is no sponsorship white knight waiting in the wings to fill the financial chasm that will be left in every sport, should this proposal be implemented.<\/p><p>  We would urge the Government to work towards a long-term, effective solution to the problems of alcohol abuse in this country by channelling the energies and focus of the various State agencies charged with responsibility for the overall health of the population, and in particular children, into one common, evidence-driven programme supported by sporting bodies such as the IRFU.<\/p><p>  I thank members of the joint committee for their time and would obviously welcome any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1364376900,"counter":795,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Browne for a very forthright view.

We have had better mornings to make presentations, but we are here anyway.<\/p><p>  I wish to thank members of the joint committee very much for giving the FAI this opportunity to discuss the topic of sports sponsorship by drinks companies.  Funding of sport is a very important issue for everyone in the country, particularly in the current downturn.  Given the numbers that sport affects and the benefits it brings to so many - not just in health and tourism, but also in building communities - it is vitally important that these issues are considered carefully by our political representatives.<\/p><p>  When most people consider sporting organisations like the FAI, they naturally tend to focus on the international team, as the Chairman pointed out a moment ago.  Underneath, however, there is so much more.  The FAI runs 24 community-based programmes through a 100-strong team in its technical department, with development officers on the ground, covering every county in the country.  There are 2,600 clubs and 450,000 participants.<\/p><p>  The work they do includes really important programmes that many will be aware of.  Over and above coach education, player development, women's football programmes, referee education and work with clubs and leagues that one would expect, we also operate other large programmes in schools and third-level institutions.  In addition, the FAI has an intercultural programme that uses football to assist with integration for the sizable number of new visitors to our country, volunteer education, child welfare programmes and football for all programmes with 13 nationally recognised disability groups.<\/p><p>  We also run a significant number of community-based programmes in the area of social inclusion, which use football as a tool to tackle important social issues such as youth unemployment, helping young offenders and combatting anti\u00adsocial behaviour - primarily, underage drinking.  One of these is our late-night leagues, which is run in co-operation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across 21 centres.  The programme takes place during prime anti-social hours from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m., when young people could cite boredom as a reason for drinking or smoking, often leading to anti-social behaviour.<\/p><p>  Making football available free and convenient to these areas late in the evening, offers a chance to engage in a healthier lifestyle option, as well as developing a positive, informal dialogue with local garda&iacute;.<\/p><p>  Garda statistics have shown that, in 2010, while holding our local late night leagues, anti-social calls to the local Garda station were reduced by 52% in Tallaght west and 49% in Ballymun.  Garda research in 2011 illustrated that on average across Dublin, in sub-divisions that held late night leagues there was a 26% reduction in anti-social behaviour related calls to these stations versus sub-divisions that did not hold late night leagues.<\/p><p>  Government funding for sport covers some of these activities but that is being reduced year on year due to the prevailing economic environment.  In 2008, the FAI's funding through the Irish Sports Council accounted for &euro;4.35 million but that has been reduced and now accounts for &euro;2.84 million, a reduction of 35%.  As a result, the Irish Sports Council's funding now equates to 17% of our operating income meaning that we, as an organisation, rely more on sponsorship and commercial agreements than we did in the past.<\/p><p>  As a sporting body which is not deemed to be a business by the Revenue Commissioners, the association is therefore not VAT-registered, so the increase in VAT from 21% to 23% during the same period has had a negative impact, increasing our costs by approximately &euro;600,000 since the change was introduced.<\/p><p>  In addition, the association has reduced ticket prices significantly during the last five years to respond to the economic environment, which has seen a decline in average ticket prices from the high &euro;40 range to the mid &euro;20 range.<\/p><p>  The potential imposition of higher rates charges on the Aviva Stadium would result in further money being taken away from the development of community-based football programmes, if it were to go ahead.<\/p> <p>The proposal to cut sponsorship would have a direct, negative impact on our ability to run these programmes, all of which contribute directly to keeping young people active, healthy and away from the temptations of substance abuse, including alcohol abuse.  Last year, 105,000 children went through our social integration programmes.  From that simple perspective, the proposal does not make sense.  Decisions must be based on sound, factual evidence.<\/p><p> While the proposals which were put forward in the February 2012 steering group report are numerous and must be considered carefully, there is no evidence to show that its proposed ban on sports sponsorship would be effective in reducing alcohol consumption among the youth.  Certainly, in France, one of the few countries to have taken such action, that has not been the case.  To take such action without evidence means cuts to programmes.  Sponsorship is much harder to come by than some would have us believe and a restriction on sponsorship by drinks companies would not be compensated for by alternative categories.  As our diverse sponsorship portfolio shows, we would already be working with alternatives if they were out there.  As political leaders, committee members must consider the unintended consequences of any decision they make.  Besides jeopardising the very programmes which are beneficial to keeping people active and away from substance abuse, a ban would have a negative impact on our ability to bid for tournaments such as Euro 2020 which have the potential to provide a major boost to the national economy.<\/p><p> In reality, alcohol sponsorship is already well regulated.  Diageo, with which we work, takes a very responsible approach.  The FAI has also developed an action plan through which we believe we can engage even more with the relevant authorities to tackle the issue of alcohol consumption in a meaningful way.  The number of people who play our sport mean that we are very well positioned to do so and I urge the committee and the Government to continue to work with us to achieve real and meaningful results.  To do otherwise and impose a sponsorship ban will have an inevitably negative impact on our ability to deliver our programmes, which are so beneficial to communities across the country and Irish society as a whole.<\/p><p> In summary, national governing bodies, like the FAI, work hard to bring the benefits of sport to society within a funding model which is severely affected by the prevailing economic and market environment.  Support from our sponsors ensures we can maintain and grow our sporting, community, fitness and health-related activities which are proven to be beneficial to society.  We urge that the positive contribution by national governing bodies in these areas not be restricted by limiting funding from existing sponsors.  Work to address societal issues like obesity and alcohol abuse can be enhanced significantly by supporting the work of associations such as the FAI in aggressively promoting sport, particularly in schools, to promote healthy lifestyles among the young.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700004#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Delaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364377500,"counter":800,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Delaney for that detailed overview.

I also wish to update the committee on the education process the GAA has already undertaken on the matter of alcohol abuse in this country.<\/p><p>  The GAA is a community-based, volunteer organisation promoting Gaelic games, culture and lifelong participation.  It has over 2,500 clubs, 302 of which are international, and almost 20,000 teams engaged in competition in Ireland.  In 2012, 82,000 children participated in our summer camps while more than 1.3 million supporters attended our intercounty championship matches.  Volunteers are the bedrock of the association.  The GAA accounts for 42% of sports volunteering in Ireland, with the total economic value of GAA volunteering estimated at approximately &euro;112 million per annum.  Revenue generated centrally allows the deployment of 317 games development personnel across the GAA to support our volunteers.  Last year, &euro;10 million was invested in games development and 84% of total revenue went back to clubs and counties.  Our clubs provide games for over 300,000 registered players.<\/p><p>  In 2012, the country's difficult economic and financial situation continued to be the dominant context and primary consideration for much of the GAA's planning and operational activities and in dealing with the direct consequences of the reduction in our income.  Many of our counties and clubs struggled and continue to struggle under worrying levels of debt.  Funding sources are fewer and yield less revenue than before.  Of the GAA's overall funding, 33% comes from commercial revenue, which means that sponsorship is a very important funding stream.<\/p><p>  The GAA is totally committed, through the promotion of its sports, to the development of healthy lifestyles and healthy attitudes to alcohol.  We accept that there are issues around the misuse of alcohol, particularly by young people, and that these issues must be addressed.  While the GAA will play a full part in trying to develop a more responsible attitude to the use of alcohol, there is no hard evidence to demonstrate that a ban on sports sponsorship will have any impact in reducing the misuse of alcohol.  The GAA's approach to tackling the harm caused by the misuse of alcohol is clear and proactive.  It is based around education and it uses a settings-based educational and intervention programme - one of the approaches recommended by the World Health Organization and the HSE - to deliver on that approach.<\/p><p>  The GAA's alcohol and substance abuse prevention programme, which is known as ASAP, was set up in 2006 on foot of a recommendation by a GAA task force brought together to explore how the misuse of alcohol was impacting negatively on GAA members and the wider population.  ASAP is a joint initiative with the HSE and is unique in the Irish sporting context.  Its aim is to minimise the harm caused by the misuse of alcohol and other substances.  It utilises the reach of the GAA network into every community in Ireland to deliver a comprehensive programme covering elements of education, prevention and response to alcohol-related issues.  Best-practice policies and resources, including an educational DVD, website, a drug and alcohol policy template for clubs and an extensive ASAP manual, are available to all members and clubs.  The programme mirrors the structures used for all GAA activities from games and coaching to integration and inclusion, with ASAP co-ordinators in place at club, county, provincial and national levels of the association.  The ASAP national committee consists of 32 county officers and four provincial officers and is chaired by a member of the HSE drugs service.  Under the GAA strategic vision and action plan, all GAA clubs have been tasked with appointing a club ASAP officer.  To date, approximately 1,400 ASAP officers have been appointed and more than 700 clubs have adopted a drug and alcohol policy.<\/p><p>  Training in drug and alcohol awareness is rolled out across all levels of the association, with coaches, parents and club and county officers as frequent participants.  The process has generated many successful partnerships with agencies that share a common goal in reducing the misuse of alcohol, including For&oacute;ige, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local drugs task forces, community groups and second and third level schools and colleges.  The programme continues to grow in its scope and design.  In January 2012, the GAA introduced the innovative health challenge \"Off the Booze and on the Ball\", which asked members to abstain from alcohol for the month in order to kick-start the new year on a healthy footing.  In 2012, we also saw the roll-out of a unique training programme for GAA coaches and ASAP officers called \"Brief Interventions\".  A brief intervention is a short, structured, supportive conversation designed to assist someone, identified as drinking in a harmful way, to make a positive change in his or her behaviour and attitude towards alcohol.  One county from each province - Armagh, Roscommon, Longford and Clare - participated in the pilot with additional training having occurred in Kerry, Dublin, Galway, Monaghan and Cavan subsequently.  The brief-intervention model was designed and delivered by HSE professionals who have previously acted as ASAP officers in their respective clubs.  The success of the ASAP programme over the last seven years has led to an expansion of the agreement with the health sector.  This resulted in the launch this month by our president, Liam O'Neill, and Tony Holohan, the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health, of the GAA healthy-club project which will assist clubs and their communities to respond to health needs in a holistic way at grassroots level.<\/p><p>  In summary, the GAA has in place an extensive alcohol education programme, the experience of which we are keen to share with other sporting organisations.  The elimination of alcohol sponsorship from sport will deliver no real benefits.  It will simply increase financial pressures on sporting bodies and their clubs.  We firmly believe the solution lies in a renewed focus on educating our population to adopt more positive attitudes to the use of alcohol and legislation to make access to alcohol more difficult and expensive for young people.  The GAA will continue to be proactive in educating our members on the use of alcohol.  The support of Government for that policy will be far more effective than the imposition of any ban on alcohol sponsorship in sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1364377500,"counter":802,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Duffy.<\/p> <p>I thank the delegations for their fine and detailed presentations which no doubt will help our committee's work.

It is clear to all of us the impact on public health and social life these three organisations have right across the country.  That is not in question.  I take a practical view about the whole issue of advertising and sponsorship by alcohol drinks companies in the sporting industry.  As some of the content originates in other jurisdictions, the notion of a blanket ban would be hard to implement.  That is not to suggest there are no issues that need to be addressed.  In the presentations, all organisations have indicated the efforts they are making to deal with alcohol abuse.  It is not a crime to consume alcohol, not yet anyway.  Clearly, the issue we all have to grapple with is the whole area of misuse.<\/p><p>  Why do the delegations think the alcohol industry seeks to advertise and sponsor their sporting activities?  Have they carried out any research on the connection between alcohol sponsorship and advertising and the conversion of teenage and young adult consumers?  Most of the work the committee has done to date suggests the concern resides with this age cohort.  A young fellow or girl sees a particular drinks company associated with a particular sporting endeavour.  They somehow seem to believe it is cool and acceptable to consume this particular alcohol product.  That is not to suggest they go on to misuse alcohol but that is the anecdotal evidence that exists.  The only way we will be successful in understanding whether that is real or imaginary is if some qualitative research is done on this matter.  Have the organisations here today done any research in that regard or would they consider doing it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700006#E00200","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364378100,"counter":805,"content":"<p>Brands advertise in order to capture market share and increase the consumption of their product.  It is interesting that over the past five years, sales of beer in Ireland have declined by 15% and yet the alcohol companies are still advertising.  The reason they do it is that they are competing against each other for brand and market share.  This is what is motivating the alcohol companies.  It is to ensure they can survive in what is a diminishing market.  We are sporting organisations so we are not equipped to do this sort of research in many respects.  This is research that should be done by the relevant organisations within Government.<\/p><p>  However, research has been done.  It is worth noting the European school survey on alcohol and drugs, carried out in 2011, which showed there was a significant decrease in heavy episodic, binge drinking - by 17% to 40% in Ireland versus 52% in the UK, 44% in France and 39% on average in the EU.  There is a perception that there is an increasing problem when an independent European body shows we actually have an improving situation.  We have been asking the Department of Health for some time to show us the evidence.  If the evidence is there, then of course we are interested in the health of the nation.  The reality is we are in an improving situation in this regard.<\/p><p>  Another interesting fact comes from France when the <i>Loi &Eacute;vin<\/i> was put in place in 1991.  The reality is that while underage abuse and misuse of alcohol is in decline in Ireland, it is on the increase in France.  There is something not quite joined up in our thinking.  I am all in favour of the relevant authorities conducting research to see if we can back up some of this independent research that has been done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Browne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364378100,"counter":806,"content":"<p>Mr. Browne has outlined very well why the alcohol drinks companies sponsor us.

The GAA is not dependent on sponsorship from the alcohol industry.  It has one long-standing sponsor, one of the longest in Irish sport, namely, Guinness.  Its sponsorship accounts for a small percentage of our overall budget.  I could not honestly make the argument that we could not survive without it because we could.  We are speaking here today on behalf of Irish sport.  Just because the GAA would not be as badly affected as others does not mean sponsorship is not important.  We are all part of the sporting nation.  The Deputy is correct that sponsorship of the GAA by the alcohol industry accounts for a relatively small percentage of its income at national level.  At club level, none of our clubs or county teams is sponsored directly by alcohol companies rather local teams are sponsored by local hotels or bars.  Sponsorship is hugely important for clubs at that level.  It is important the impression is not given that alcohol is the problem.  Often the local bar is the centre of the community and sponsorship by a bar of a local GAA club is part of a community initiative and no more.  At local level, a number of our clubs receive sponsorship from hotels or bars.  Sponsorship at national level is not huge.<\/p><p>  At national level, the only sponsor of the GAA is Guinness.  It has been our sponsor for many years.  It does not target its sponsorship at young people rather it is targeted at a GAA audience of older people.  We would have no concerns about how that sponsorship has been handled and so on.  I would like to reiterate a point I made earlier in my presentation.  The view of the GAA is that sponsorship by alcohol companies should be allowed not because the GAA would be affected directly if it was withdrawn but because of its effect on sports generally.  The GAA believes passionately that the way forward is through education.  With funding from the HSE, the GAA has three people working full time in this area.  We are making huge strides in this regard.  We have shared what we are doing with the FAI and IRFU.  We believe the way forward is to invest in educating people, using the sporting bodies.  We are in the game and are willing to play a bigger role in it.  We recently launched the healthy clubs initiative with Dr. Tony Holohan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364378700,"counter":811,"content":"<p>Carlsberg sponsors the FAI.

The FAI's turnover rises and decreases year-on-year and depends on whether or not Ireland qualifies for the European championships and what matches are played.  For example, the FAI received &euro;5 million in television rights from the Ireland versus Germany home match last year, which was a sell-out.  Had that game been played in 2013 our revenue in 2012 would have dropped.  Our revenue would not be as even-handed as that of some of the other sporting organisations.

I have been chief executive of the FAI for approximately nine years.  During that time, social inclusion has become a big part of the thinking of the organisation for the 105,000 youths involved.  If we had to make a decision about cutting funding, international sport and player development is our priority.  I do not want them to be our priority or to cut social inclusion but our cutbacks would have to be in that area.

It is not realistic to compare what happens in Ireland with what happens in France.  One must look at the entire funding model of sport in the jurisdiction to understand it.  In France, sport is held in great regard by the Government.  It is extremely well funded in terms of facilities and operational expenditure.  That is not to suggest that sport is not held in high regard by the Irish Government.  We are talking about difference of scale not only in terms of the amount of money allocated to the sports budget in France, which is funded by central government and local government, but in terms the size of the French sponsorship market, which is approximately 15 times that of Ireland.  The reality is that French clubs playing in the Heineken Cup have, as a result of the marketplace being so much larger, a much wider range of possibilities.  Another important issue is where French rugby sits in the pantheon of sports in France.  It sits very close to the top.  The television deal which France has in respect of its domestic rugby competitions is vast.  Its reliance on alcohol sponsorship is different to ours, which is the reason it can survive without it.<\/p><p>  Another issue, which relates back to our discussion in the past about television rights, is that we are one of six participating in a pan-European competition where alcohol sponsorship ultimately is a deliverable.  If we do not deliver on what the sponsor requires there is a financial consequence.  There are also financial consequences for French clubs, which at the end of the day they can live with but which Ireland, in terms of its small marketplace of 4.5 million to 5 million, cannot.  The IRFU would welcome meaningful interaction with the HSE on how it can assist.  There has to date been no such interaction.  We would urge the committee to support that type of engagement.  In terms of the IRFU's code of ethics, all our clubs sign up to a code of ethics which includes sections in regard to substance misuse, alcohol abuse and recommendations on how matches at under-age level are managed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700007#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1364378700,"counter":813,"content":"<p>As many members have indicated their wish to ask questions, I will take questions from them in two groups, the first being Deputy Ellis.

Having heard the contributions of the three delegates my first impression is that the general consensus is that a ban on alcohol sponsorship would have a huge affect on the organisations, although in terms of what they can deliver rather than their continuing in operation.<\/p> <p>I refer to what the organisations can deliver in social and other areas.<\/p><p> I am very familiar with the running of the late night leagues.  This issue has been raised with the JPCs and we have noticed there has been a drop in crime levels when these leagues and other events are taking place.  We have argued that pulling people more into sport in different areas would reduce anti-social behaviour.  It would give people, particularly young people, something to do.  <\/p><p> I wonder where such a ban would lead us.  We are dealing with the question of a ban on alcohol sponsorship of major events.  Local clubs rely on the sponsorship by local pubs, which are advertised on the clubs' jerseys.  I would like to hear the representatives' opinions on the effect such a ban would have at that level.  Such sponsorship provides the bread and butter funding for most clubs and a ban on alcohol sponsorship would have an awful effect on them.  Where would such a ban lead?  Will we have a ban on advertising by McDonald's because of the problem of obesity?  Will we have a ban on the advertising of fizzy drinks because they have an impact on people's health?  <\/p><p> I do not know what the French formula is on such sponsorship.  Do they have an outright ban on alcohol sponsorship?  The representatives might advise if it is an outright ban or a partial ban and what the ban entails.  <\/p><p> Surprisingly, there is a high number of non-drinkers in this country which people do not tend to realise.  It is a very small market that the drinks companies target.  I do not tend to pay much heed to the advertisements, even when I attend a match.  I was at the match last night and I am devastated by the result.<\/p><p> Such a ban would have a side effect on these companies.  I am not asking the representatives to talk about the companies but if Guinness, Carlsberg and other drinks companies put money towards sponsorship, such a ban on sponsorship could have an effect in terms of employment and other areas.  I do not know if that is a question for the representatives to answer but it is one for all of us to bear in mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700007#F00600","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364379300,"counter":816,"content":"<p>Deputy Ellis has raised a few interesting points.  My understanding of the proposal put forward by the Minister of State, Deputy White, is that it is not only a ban on alcohol sponsorship of major events but a ban on alcohol sponsorship which would be similar to the <i>Loi &Eacute;vin<\/i> in France, which is a total outright ban on the sponsorship by alcohol companies of sporting events from top to bottom throughout the system.<\/p><p>  The Deputy has raised some valid points around where this proposal would lead us.  Obesity is a major issue and there is the issue of the advertising of soft drinks, products with a high level of sugar and fats and all the rest of it.  I cannot answer that question.  The Department of Heath may well be able to do so and it may be better for the HSE to tell us in what direction it wants to go.  <\/p><p>  As to where this would lead in terms of local clubs, one would be mistaken to think that a ban on alcohol sponsorship of major events alone would not have any consequences for clubs.  We spend about &euro;9.5 million on what we call domestic rugby which is effectively amateur club rugby and schools rugby.  Part of that &euro;9.5 million comes from the Government, for which we are grateful, and for every &euro;1 the Government puts in, we put in nearly &euro;3.  We get about &euro;2.75 million from the Government, for which we are very grateful, and we spend more than &euro;9 million on domestic rugby.  The reality is that our ability to spend money at club level will be dissipated if we do not have the income from alcohol sponsorship to put into our general pot of income along with the income from television and other sponsorships.  That is a significant issue.<\/p><p>  Another issue is that clubs have their own arrangements.  They have their own perimeter boards and arrangements with local sponsors and with bars, some of which provide changing facilities for clubs.  This goes right down to grassroots sport and we need to be very careful that we do not unravel something which is very good and positive for the health of the nation and turn it into a disaster.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned a number of possible side effects from the imposition of such a ban.  A number of dividends flow from sport.  We already spoke about one, namely, the health dividend.  The Report of the National Taskforce on Obesity stated that the direct and indirect cost of obesity to this country is &euro;4 billion.  Who has the cohort of the population within their control where it is possible to manage to do something to help those people, particularly in their formative years, to understand what constitutes a healthy lifestyle?  The answer to that question is sport and the major sporting organisations which deliver sport and education in healthy outdoor activity.  We need to be very careful here.  We have something on the one hand which we are potentially risking, which is the input of sport in terms of doing something positive to tackle the problem of obesity.  Are we are going to upset that against a perceived risk around sponsorship by alcohol companies which, if removed, would have some amazing impact on abuse of alcohol?  The answer is it probably would not have such an impact.  What we would do is risk something much greater, namely, the input of sport in terms of promoting the health of the nation and addressing the problem of obesity.  <\/p><p>  There are other dividends, the detail of which I do not want to go into.  There is the economic dividend in terms of employment, which the Deputy mentioned.  Much greater would be the economic loss if sport was not competitive.  I refer particularly to our sport, much of which comprises cross-border competitions.  We bring huge amounts of money into the economy through international events.  A Six Nations match generates about &euro;50 million in economic terms for the city of Dublin and the greater Leinster area, and the economic impact of it extends far beyond Dublin.  That is the economic benefit of only one match.  The same applies to soccer, hurling and football.  We need to be very careful that we do not unravel something which is very good.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy also mentioned the social impact of sport.  Sport, particularly team sports, deliver a number of benefits, namely, education and experience for children in interacting with other people in a responsible fashion, understanding how to deal with winning and losing and understanding their self-awareness and social responsibility.  We do not want to lose any of that.  We need to be very careful that we understand the consequences of decisions that we take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700008#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1364379300,"counter":817,"content":"<p>A mobile phone is causing interference with the recording of the proceedings.

The three points I would make is that if such sponsorship was cut we would not be able to run those programmes as well as we do.  As a result of that, there would be more crime, a higher level of obesity and more difficulties in communities, of that there is no question.  The Deputy asked about the clubs and he was dead on in what he said.  We have 2,600 clubs and many of those would be sponsored by local pubs.  It is becoming tougher for clubs to survive in terms of funding through the sale of lottery tickets and other such sales.  We receive requests weekly and monthly to assist them.  If a club did not have a local bar as a sponsor it would diminish its ability to operate.  That is a simple fact.<\/p><p>  Mr. Browne has given some funding figures.  We hosted the Europa League final here a few years ago but the one on which we are now focused is Euro 2020 which will be hosted in 13 cities.  Our board has decided to be one of the applicants to host it and I think we have a decent chance of securing that although it will be difficult.  I am on the committee in Europe that decides on the criteria that will apply and one of the models the committee is examining is what local sponsorship would be brought in, in other words, what return from that would go to UEFA.

As someone who has come through a career in sports for the past 50 years at this stage, and that is not saying how old I am, I do not believe that alcohol sponsorship had an effect on my career as a sports person.  As a coach and a mentor for many young boys and girls during the past number of years, I see the very positive effect sports have on the development of these young men and women.<\/p> <p>Alcohol misuse has not come into the equation with them.  I agree 100% with the presentations.  I do not believe that banning sponsorship by alcohol companies would have any effect on reducing the misuse of alcohol in Ireland.  I commend the GAA, the IRFU, the FAI and all the national governing bodies all around the country and their volunteers who instil incredible confidence in and educate the young people in Ireland.  It has already been pointed out that the ban imposed in France in 1991 resulted in a small change at the beginning but the level of alcohol misuse is at or may have exceeded the level that pertained prior to that time.  I believe this is a societal issue not just in Ireland but around the world.  I also believe it is a cultural issue around sports where alcohol is a friendly means of socialising with one another as opposed to using sports as a way of promoting the misuse of alcohol.  It is an educational issue.  First and foremost, it is an educational issue at home; it is what the children see going on at home.  If parents are heavy drinkers the likelihood is that their children will get involved in alcohol and that they will put peer pressure on their friends whose families may not be involved with alcohol.  <\/p><p> A former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, imposed a ban on smoking in bars and public places.  While there are now graphic images on cigarettes packs I do not believe they have had much effect in reducing smoking in Ireland.  Therefore, I do not believe that banning the advertising of alcoholic products will have much effect.  <\/p><p> In my sport of athletics, for 50 years Nestl&eacute; Corporation through the medium of Kit Kat sponsored the Irish schools athletics events.  Unfortunately, they were told they could no longer promote Kit Kat products in schools in Ireland because of the obesity levels and the use of chocolate.  What happened there?  There was a huge void in schools athletics because no company was willing to sponsor the schools athletics programme.  It was crazy.  Has that reduced the consumption of chocolate among young children in Ireland?  Not a chance.  If we want to ban the use of chocolate by children it should not be placed at the shop counter beside the till.  However, there is somewhat of a paradox here that sports organisations, while they promote healthy lifestyles, also take on board sponsorship from other organisations.

The impact of each of the associations on the social and economic life of the country cannot be underestimated.  The sporting personalities, the heroes, who are part of the associations and the union, have far more credibility than anybody in this room.  In terms of public perception, people adore them, they follow them, they spend money to watch them and they are important personalities in the life of the country, as are the associations.  I read an article last week which indicated that, <i>per capita<\/i>, Ireland has more arena seats than any other country, bar Iceland as its population is less than 500,000.  That is the reality.  Sport is a huge phenomenon in Ireland and we tend to punch above our weight.  In that respect I take the point about unintended consequences of decisions taken.<\/p><p>  However, I also want to touch on some of the issues where advertisers in a diminishing market become very clever in how they get their message across.  For example, who would have thought that Arthur's Day would almost have become a national holiday?  One cannot have a birthday party unless it is a Carlsberg party or better than the Carlsberg people can do it.  This is becoming a part of our lives and it is done subliminally.  It is interesting to note how this has happened in a diminishing market.  For example, wine consumption is an increasing market and yet I have never heard of any <i>chateauneuf de pape<\/i> coming in to sponsor anybody.  That seems unusual.<\/p><p>  At the same time the witnesses speak of a diminishing market and those companies competing among themselves.  I submit that three associations are also competing in the market for participants but they have a different dynamic.  Those companies get involved to maximise their income.  Rather than consider an outright ban or a prohibition on sponsorship, about which I am uncomfortable, is there any proposal by the associations and the union to ratchet up the use of some of their personalities on the message against alcohol misuse?  Something like that would have a far greater impact on younger impressionable individuals than the prohibition of alcohol.  I do not hear that from some of our greatest personalities in the message against alcohol misuse.<br \/> An issue that has not been mentioned is that in the past many of our heroes have fallen victim to alcohol right across the sporting arena.  How do the associations and the union use that example to discourage alcohol misuse within the organisations?  An issue arises where for somebody who retires from the games there is a vacuum and regrettably that vacuum is easily filled in an inappropriate manner.   As many have rehabilitated and gone through the wringer and have come out the other side, their messages would be very valuable to younger people.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700009#H00400","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1364379900,"counter":826,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives of the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU to the committee and recognise the vital role they play in regard to sport, particularly for young people.

It gives some compelling reasons such as that the average age of first alcohol use in children has dropped from the age of 15 to 14, that one in five 16 year olds is a weekly drinker, that four out of ten in the 16 to 21 year old category wear alcohol branded clothing and that in 2007 alcohol related illnesses cost &euro;1.2 billion and alcohol related crime cost &euro;1.9 billion.

In other words, the view is that if we do not have alcohol advertising in sport we will have some impact on sales in a positive way in terms of reducing sales of beer.  The majority of sponsorship of alcohol in the country is for beer and it is largely around the two major brands of beer, Guinness and Heineken.  I pointed out earlier that the reality is that sales have declined by 15% during the past five years, but there is no indication that there has been any reduction in the level of alcohol advertising of either Heineken or Guinness.  Therefore, there is no evidence of that linkage.  Deputy Harrington noted that wine sales have increased significantly during recent years but the fact is that there is not much advertising by the wine industry in the country.

He is absolutely correct, it is very effective.  Let us suppose that a ban on alcohol sponsorship in sport was introduced.  We can assume that the investment the companies make would go elsewhere.  They would continue to invest in marketing their products.  The money may not go to sport but they would find other ways of investing their money.  It would be taken from sport and invested elsewhere.  This is important because we have tried to point out today that if there was hard evidence that alcohol sponsorship of sport had an impact on increasing the numbers of young people drinking we would all have to take a totally different line, but the evidence is not there.<\/p><p>  A question was asked about player welfare.  Our player welfare is conducted largely through the money we give to the GPA.  We hand it over to intercounty players.  The Deputy is correct.  There have been many cases of players with alcohol or gambling addictions and so on.  Considerable work is being done to deal with players who find it hard to withdraw from the limelight and so on.  The Deputy is correct to state it is a real issue.  We are doing that work quietly beneath the radar.  We use players from time to time.  Often we use our top players to speak in clubs about alcohol education as part of our education programme.  The Deputy is correct.  Perhaps we need to do more in the public domain but certainly we use our players in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1364380500,"counter":832,"content":"<p>I apologise for missing most of the presentation.

There is a parallel between the hearings we held in recent weeks on the Internet and the hearing today.  Some people want to believe that it is possible to close down the Internet or to somehow produce some sort of stick or police force over the Internet.  In the same way some people believe naively that by removing a connection between one industry and a sporting organisation we can somehow solve a social ill.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I have never seen a 13 year old or 14 year old going to or coming from hurling, football, rugby or soccer training with a naggin of vodka in his hand, but one might find him at a disused railway line or an old industrial estate up to absolutely nothing save for what he should not be up to with a naggin of vodka or, worse, perhaps a couple of flagons of cider.<\/p><p>  My general question is whether it is appropriate for a person to push a shopping trolley out the front of a supermarket laden with alcohol and no one asks a question about it, or is it appropriate that a local GAA club runs a table quiz in the local parish pub and gets the publican to provide the sandwiches?  That is effectively a sponsorship but it could be banned in future.  I speak as someone whose brother is a publican and who supports all codes in Deputy Harrington's constituency in west Cork.  I know from speaking to him that whether it is a table quiz, a 1980s night, a darts tournament or even if it is providing glasses or bunting for some sporting events, all of this is up on the table and people should be very careful.  It is not simply about the Heineken Cup or the Guinness hurling championship; the under-18 or under-16 blitz could be affected inadvertently and I am concerned about that.<\/p><p>  I realise there is commercial sensitivity with regard to the amounts but it is important to get a ballpark figure for the amounts of money at issue nationally.  Deputy Phelan is perfectly correct to ask whether there is an alternative.  I know from a Government point of view that it is simply not a runner.  As Mr. Delaney pointed out, the overall amount has halved during the past four or five years when one takes into consideration VAT and so on.  If we are to pretend that we can maintain an international semblance of sport for the IRFU, the GAA, through the international matches with the Australians, and the FAI and have codes at home at the same time, then we need to examine this in detail.<\/p> <p>If we are going to pretend that we can maintain an international sporting presence for the IRFU and the GAA, through the latter's international matches with the Australians, and through the FAI, while at the same time having codes at home, we need to study in detail how much is involved and where.  I do not know any industry that can afford to stump up the type of money that is being spoken about here in a diminishing market.  We need to tread very carefully.  The facilities provided by the codes in my own county, whether at parish, county or provincial level, have massive debts which somebody has to service.  Part of the servicing involves bringing people in to see a game or match and that requires a sponsor.  Without a sponsor the game or tournament cannot go ahead.  These are implications that people need to consider carefully.  I understand the commercial sensitivity but it would do us a great favour if we knew the ballpark figure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700010#J00900","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364381100,"counter":838,"content":"<p>We will get somebody to answer that question.

Ireland is recognised worldwide as a sporting nation despite its small population.  Historically, because of its surplus cash the drinks industry has been able to use organisations such as those here today as a sort of cover.  It gives the industry some respectability, because it treats alcohol as a harmless substance like Ballygowan.  Several people have mentioned the dilemma posed by the drinks industry's support of the three codes here because it does not contribute to additional sales for the brands.  I agree but that is not what the drinks industry is up to.  In the 1990s the French Government exposed the issue and took its decision.  The same happened in Spain.  No other industry in this country can compare with the drinks industry which is so lucrative because it has so much cash.<\/p><p>  People argue that people's drinking habits have changed and more drink wine but we do not see wine producers sponsoring sport.  Wine drinking has been on the increase since the introduction of cheap flights and we discovered we could be trendy and drink wine.  When the consumption of wine starts to go down we will see whether the producers will be prepared to get involved in sponsorship.<\/p><p>  There is a great difficulty, not just for sportsmen and the organisations here today, but for us as legislators although it costs the taxpayer &euro;3.4 billion annually.  Imagine the standard of living Irish people would have if they did not have to fork out &euro;3.4 billion for policing, accident and emergency services, court hearings, etc.  To quote a former Taoiseach, we would be the richest country in the world.  We have a real difficulty with alcohol.  It is the national drug.  We have difficulty saying this and owning up to it.  As legislators we have not been good at doing anything about it.  People have spoken about obesity caused by people eating too much take-away food and chocolate.  I have never in my life heard of a man over-consuming chocolate and going home and beating up his wife or going onto the street after over-consuming take-away food and beating up garda&iacute; or his neighbour or whoever.  We have a difficulty here and the drinks industry gets cover which I think should be taken away.  Then we should move on to dealing with the real issues.  We have an obsession with talking about under-age drinking.  There is under-age drinking but there is also over-age drinking and I speak as one who consumes alcohol.  It is the national drug.

If someone could show us evidence that alcohol sponsorship of sport is contributing to an increase in, or to the level of, drinking I would like to hear those arguments.  In their absence I strongly believe that Government should be investing in education.

Sport promotes health and well-being.  I am involved in sport myself; I am involved in a snooker club and a kayaking club, and I do a lot of running and have run marathons, etc.  If it was not for the organisations represented here, we could multiply the figure in terms of the damage that is done by obesity and alcohol abuse.  Sport is also good from a mental health point of view.  I do not know what I would on a Saturday if I could not follow, difficult and all as it is, QPR's results or those of Sligo Rovers at the weekend.  It would mean that life would be much duller.  For that, the representatives' organisations must be commended and well done to them.<\/p><p>  The most important point made here today was made by Deputy Ann Phelan, namely, that the organisations have become dependent on the alcohol industry, and that is an awful pity.  We need to establish exactly how dependent in monetary terms they have become on this industry.  Ultimately, the organisations represented want to do what they do, namely, promote sport and to be successful at it.  If they could do that without alcohol sponsorship in the morning, I believe they would run a mile from it.  It is not good for the organisations and it is not good for young people that they are connected with it.  As many people have said, we need to establish how much money the organisations get from the alcohol industry and how that can be replaced.  We can throw into the mix a figure floating around that alcohol abuse costs this state &euro;3 billion or more a year, depending on the figures one goes by.  If that harm was reduced by 1%, that would result in a saving of &euro;30 million.  Would the saving of that amount cover the sponsorship figure?  We need to consider this in a more holistic way and to consider the overall picture.  While it would be a challenge to move away from alcohol sponsorship, I am firmly of the belief that it is unhealthy that there is any connection with alcohol.  <\/p><p> Do we need a scientific study to tell us that it is a bad thing for an eight year old boy to walk around wearing a jersey with an alcohol advertisement on the front of it?  We need to move away from that.  The issue of Kit Kat and other product sponsorship was mentioned.  Should such sponsorship also be banned?  I would not go for a ban on outside alcohol advertising but sporting organisations need to look at the bigger picture.  The bigger picture is that if children eat less sweet, rubbish and take-aways from McDonald's or wherever, we will have a higher standard of sportsperson.  However, in order to achieve any of this, we need to kill the dependence sport has on the alcohol industry and on some other areas which do not help our health.<\/p><p>  No one refers to the European Rugby Cup by that title; they refer to it as the Heineken Cup.  That, to me, demeans what is a phenomenally good and exciting tournament.  It has brought rugby to areas where people were not interested in it.  However, do we need to have Heineken involved?  Guinness sponsorship was also mentioned.  The GAA's connection with Guinness unfortunately perpetuates the myth that Guinness is good for one.  I like a pint, I like a pint of Guinness and I like a few pints but I am under no illusion that it is good for me because it is not.  It is anything but good for one.  As long as the organisations represented are connected to this industry, the more that myth can be perpetuated.  I believe that alcohol advertising should be banned.  I do not see the purpose of it.  If any other substance such as cannabis was legalised in the future, the advertising of it should also be banned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700012#L00900","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364381700,"counter":855,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1364381700,"counter":856,"content":"<p>There is no need to push a substance like alcohol because people will use it anyway.

That would go a long way towards reducing the dependence on alcohol sponsorship of the organisations represented.  It would also stop them having to come in here and nearly argue that it is not a bad thing when in fact such sponsorship is not in anyone's interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700012#L01100","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1364381700,"counter":857,"content":"<p>Deputy John O'Mahony wants to make to brief point before I call the three presenters for their final comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700012#L01200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1364381700,"counter":858,"content":"<p>It is a related issue regarding the perception of alcohol.

The revenue generated from sources other than the alcoholic drinks industry and all other forms of sponsorship has fallen considerably.  We have all suffered in that regard.<\/p><p>  Senator Coghlan mentioned sponsorship by Nestl&eacute;'s Kit Kat brand.  It is very hard to get alternative sponsors.

If it is so bad, we should be talking about banning alcohol.  We are talking about the effect of alcohol sponsorship on sport and drinking habits.

In the nine years I have been in my post, with the support of my board, I have run a considerable number of social programmes.  I do not want to lose those.  Consider what would occur if I had a priority list.  The Irish public ultimately wants to see a national team doing well.  Last night was evidence of that.  Had we won by two goals to one, today would be a different day for me.<\/p><p>  If we end up losing alcohol industry sponsorship, it will mean taking money from our programmes, which will have a greater damaging effect on the community.  That is the point I am trying to put across.  Generally, we do not sell alcohol in general admission areas in the Aviva Stadium.  It is sold only in the premium levels.  That is an Aviva rule for competitive matches.  Only soft drinks would be sold in the general admission areas for competitive matches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700013#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Delaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1364382300,"counter":866,"content":"<p>Is it allowed out in the stadium?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700013#M00700","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364382300,"counter":867,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700013#M00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Delaney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364382300,"counter":868,"content":"<p>With regard to Deputy Flanagan's point, I echo what Mr. Delaney said.  Ours is a not-for-profit organisation just like the GAA and FAI.  The reality is that if we have less income coming in, we can do less.  We are not dependent on it but would obviously like to make a contribution to society.  It costs money.  Sport can only be delivered by people, and it is delivered in the main by volunteers.  Ultimately, in order to orchestrate and manage volunteers, one has to spend money on professional staff and resourcing clubs around the country.  The money is spent on people and programmes, effectively to support the voluntary system.<\/p><p>  With regard to what happens in the Aviva Stadium for rugby matches, alcohol is available from when the turnstiles are opened until the stadium is closed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700013#M00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1364382300,"counter":869,"content":"<p>Are spectators allowed to bring alcohol to their seats?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032700013#M01000","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1364382300,"counter":870,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives of the three organisations, the members and non-members.
