A wide variety of military training activities is specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies.  Regular co-ordination and liaison meetings also take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on ATCP issues.<\/p>  <p>  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment is available for deployment in response to any security issue or other emergency that may arise. <\/p><p>Within the Defence Forces, both the Ordnance Corps and the Army Ranger Wing specialise in providing an immediate response to emergency incidents that might require their highly specialised capabilities.  The Ordnance Corps consists of a number of explosive ordnance disposal teams which are on standby 24\/7 to respond when a request for assistance is received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with suspect devices.  It is worth noting to the House that there have been 500 such call-outs in the last three years and that the Defence Forces have never failed to deal comprehensively and safely with any of those challenges.<br\/><br\/>The Army Ranger Wing is an integral unit of the Defence Forces whose\u00a0roles\u00a0include provision of\u00a0specialist ATCP support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The need for a high level of preparedness to deal with any requests for special forces operations is inherent in the unit's mission.  Members are trained to the highest levels of motivation, physical fitness and skill-at-arms for their specialist role.

I also confirm that a further review of operational plans has been instigated by the Defence Forces in light of the dreadful terrorist attacks that occurred in Paris just over a week ago.  It is my priority as Minister for Defence to ensure that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible.

Within the White Paper, we talk about the need for flexibility, modernisation, change and constant review processes.  In fact, the new White Paper sets out that the Defence Forces will have a fundamental review every three years.

Approximately three drugs are available that could be used to protect serving personnel abroad from malaria.  None of them is without issues and problems.  There is no simple solution.  Nobody is denying that some people have negative side effects when they take Lariam.  However, it is a matter of weighing up risk factors to protect people from a very serious disease and at the same time doing everything we can, within reason, to screen people to ensure they are suitable candidates for Lariam before they take it.

It is not a mutual defence clause but a mutual assistance clause.  There is a big difference.  The article states:<\/p><blockquote>If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.  This shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States.<\/blockquote><p>In other words, for a country like Ireland, we have an obligation to look at how we can be of assistance, but we do not have an obligation to do anything that in any way undermines or contradicts our own policy on defence, which is one of neutrality.  Therefore, this idea that we are somehow compromising neutrality is just not true, and we are not being asked to do it either by France or by anybody else.  What I have said in response to the extraordinary and tragic attacks on the streets of Paris is that Ireland would do what it could within the confines of what we can do.  Consistent with our own policy, laws and Constitution, we will do what we can to help.<\/p><p>The context in which we spoke about Mali was that if France makes a decision that it needs to redeploy some of those troops - which it may do, because they are spread across multiple peacekeeping missions right across North Africa, from the Central African Republic to Mali, Somalia and into the Middle East - to focus on national security issues, which is their decision, then the UN will have problems in terms of those peacekeeping missions that may have reduced personnel.  It is in that context that Ireland may well speak to the UN about how we could offer some expertise.  We have a lot of expertise and credibility in peacekeeping; we are very good at it.  However, people should not try to link Irish neutrality with assistance to France, as if Ireland is involved in some kind of offensive operation.<\/p><p>If France feels the need to reallocate resources towards national security, which is very reasonable in the context of what has just happened there, Ireland will obviously consider assisting, from a UN perspective and from a good neighbour perspective, by potentially picking up some of that burden.

The health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces is a priority, as I said earlier to Deputy Crowe.  As I have already indicated to the House, the choice of medication for overseas deployment, including the use of Lariam, is a medical decision made by medical officers in the Defence Forces, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual members of the Defence Forces.  Significant precautions are taken by the Defence Forces' medical officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of the Irish Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications.  It is the policy of the Irish Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for services overseas and medical suitability, and a medical risk assessment for Lariam is carried out on an individual basis.  The Irish Defence Forces policy on the use of anti-malarial medication is in line with the Health Products Regulatory Authority's current approved summary of product characteristics.<\/p><p>As I previously indicated to the House, my Department established a working group in January 2011 to examine the use of Lariam and other anti-malarial drugs in the Defence Forces.  The group produced its report to a former Minister for Defence in 2013.  I am advised that the group investigated the allegations surrounding the use of Lariam and obtained the advice of leading medical experts who concurred with the prescribing practices followed by the Defence Forces.  Since production of its report, members of the working group have continued to monitor developments in the area of malaria.<\/p> <p> My Department has recently reconvened the working group which is engaging once again with experts, both nationally and internationally, on the use of Lariam and other anti-malarial drugs in the Defence Forces.

The suggestion that there are no complications or problems with the other available drugs for malaria is also not the way it is.  If it were the case, we would transfer to another drug.  Nobody is suggesting there are no problems with Lariam but we are trying to minimise those problems through effective screening, with Lariam only being used where it is the recommended drug to minimise the likelihood of having a problem with malaria.

The securing of alternative housing is a matter for the individuals concerned in the first instance.

The Department initiated discussions with Kildare County Council to determine whether there was a possibility of a joint initiative to provide solutions to the overholding issues in the Curragh.

In the past ten months alone, 80,000 patients admitted to hospital had to languish on trolleys for an unacceptable length of time.  Last month was the 15th month in a row that increasing numbers of people were waiting far too long on trolleys.  This period coincides with the period since the appointment of the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar.  In other words, the position is getting progressively worse, month after month.  Last week, Beaumont Hospital apologised for the appalling treatment of the late Gerry Feeney, whose family described the distressing and traumatic circumstances surrounding his treatment.  There have been many more similar incidents, including 90 and 91 year olds waiting on trolleys for 29 hours.<\/p>  <p>  If one speaks to nurses working in emergency departments, as I have, the familiar refrain one hears is that it is very difficult to retain staff in emergency departments or attract staff to emergency departments because of the conditions and the unacceptable circumstances in which they must work.  I meet nurses across the country on an ongoing basis who consistently give me that message.  Morale in emergency departments is at an all-time low due to the record numbers of people waiting on trolleys in recent months, so much so that the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has balloted for industrial action in emergency departments.<\/p><p>Of the emergency department nurses who were balloted, 92% voted in favour of strike action in the middle of December.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400017#P01700","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448380800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>A question, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400018#Q00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1448380800,"counter":143,"content":"<p>They have had enough of the broken promises on this issue.

Does he accept that staff retention and recruitment is extremely difficult, that patient safety is compromised because of what is going on and that the Government has constantly under-resourced this sector of the health service over the last number of years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400018#Q00300","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1448380800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I accept that there are recurring challenges in the health system, not the least of which is in the accident and emergency departments.  I am disappointed that the INMO has voted in favour of industrial action.  While the outcome was expected, industrial action will not sort out the challenges we face.  The director general of the HSE has already affirmed that health service management is keen to use the machinery of the State to deal with the decision of the INMO, which it was entitled to make.  The emergency department task force has a specific plan which was developed in accordance with the authorities.  The task force is co-chaired by the director general of the HSE and the INMO's general secretary.  It is important to say that overcrowding continues to be a problem and the frustrations of staff have been expressed to myself and many others because of the pressure they work under in particular situations.  The Deputy should know, though, that a strike will not assist a single patient on any trolley or in any accident and emergency unit or hospital.<\/p>  <p>  The number of people on trolleys is 20% lower today than it was on the same day last year.  The figures produced by the nurses themselves accept that overcrowding is slightly lower than it was this time last year.  That is a big change from August of this year, when overcrowding was 40% worse, and it is also clear that we are a long way from the very bad situation at the start of this year when between 500 and 600 people were on trolleys in hospitals.  The implementation of the emergency department task force plan is beginning to yield beneficial results.  We have seen the expansion of community intervention teams to deliver services outside hospitals.  Mount Carmel is the first community hospital to open in that regard.  There has been a reopening of 100 beds that had been closed and the opening of a further 100 new beds.  There will be 100 more beds in next couple of weeks and a further 100 between December and January.  These are beds for which provision has been made in the budget and they have been brought about by the intervention of the Minister for Health.  They will do a good deal to alleviate the pressure that has been built up.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, it is fair to say that the investment in the fair deal scheme has brought the waiting period down from 16 weeks to two to four weeks and thereby reduced the level of delayed discharges in our hospitals by approximately 250.  That, together with the home care packages, provides opportunities in the community for patients to receive treatment so that they do not have to be in hospital in the first place.  I hope the negotiations can take place to prevent a strike which will not help any patient.  The plan put in place by the task force co-chaired by the secretary general of the INMO is now beginning to yield very positive results.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400018#Q00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1448380800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach did not answer the questions I put to him, including the question about whether the Government has under-resourced the health service over the last number of years and particularly the area under discussion.

We have had a series of shocking revelations, such as the one that is cited <i>ad nauseam<\/i>of a man in his 90s being forced to spend 29 hours on a trolley.  These are the front-line conditions in which nurses are working.  They are being forced to take industrial action in support of all front-line staff and in defence of patient care.  Those staff and patients have been let down by the Government.  This crisis is a direct result of the Government's continual refusal to deal with the accident and emergency unit overcrowding chaos and resource a public health service properly.  This is the flaw in the situation.<\/p><p>In 2013, the then Minister, Deputy Reilly, stated we would never again see 569 people on trolleys in a single day while this Government was in office.  Under the current Minister, Deputy Varadkar, the situation has worsened.  There are increased numbers on trolleys, delayed discharges, a lack of home care packages and a lack of public and nursing home beds.<\/p><p>Front-line workers perform heroics every day.  In the first ten months of this year, almost 80,000 admitted patients were on trolleys, the highest ever figure for the first ten months of any year since trolley watch began.  As we sit in the Chamber and the Taoiseach jokes and banters with Fianna F&aacute;il, there are 339 patients on trolleys.

Will the Taoiseach contend with the same Minister if the service is not getting better?  For one reason or another, one Minister moved away from the health portfolio.  Everyone deserves a chance, and I am not saying they do not, but ultimately, there are patients, including children and the elderly, who deserve to be looked after.  The problem has not been sorted.

Of course, he never did that; he just kept saying it week after week.  One of the first measures he took when he became Taoiseach was to halve the amount of time for Taoiseach's questions.  He got rid of the Wednesday slot, so he reduced the accountability of the Taoiseach in respect of his Department and policy issues by 50%.  Then, when Tuesday afternoon sessions were cancelled for a variety of reasons, they were never rescheduled.  Suffice it to say that he is perhaps the most unaccountable Taoiseach we have had, certainly since I came into D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  He ducks and dives and avoids questions to an extraordinary degree both in the House and publicly elsewhere.  It is extraordinary the degree to which he does not engage in public debate.

The UK Government delegation was led by the UK Secretary of State, Philip Hammond.  The Northern Ireland Executive was represented by the First Minister, Peter Robinson, and Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness.  The council discussed the continuing improving economic situation in member administrations, recognising the interdependence and the links between their economies.  The council also specifically focused on work being done relating to the misuse of substances.  The council discussed the significant harm being caused by alcohol to individuals, families and society.<\/p>  <p>  At the June British-Irish Council I also took the opportunity to have direct talks with the First Minister, Mr. Robinson, and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, in respect of the then current impasse on budgetary and financial matters.  This was the last meeting I had with the First Minister, Mr. Robinson, prior to him subsequently temporarily stepping aside as First Minister on 10 September.<\/p>  <p>  I am in regular contact with the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, regarding the situation in Northern Ireland and a range of other issues of mutual interest, including the EU-UK membership negotiations.  We regularly use the opportunity of European Council meetings to meet and we did so most recently on 23 September and 15 and 16 October.  The Prime Minister and I are in touch by telephone.  We spoke on 2 September, following which we jointly invited the parties in Northern Ireland to talks.  These talks in Stormont were facilitated by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  My comments in the media at the time outlined the Government's position on the prospects for successful talks.  We spoke again by telephone on 20 October regarding the UK assessment of paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland.  The decision of those in the Ulster Unionist Party in September to withdraw their Minister from the executive was one they were entitled to make.  I am unsure whether it was particularly helpful to the process at the time but I respect their right to make that call.  Ultimately, of course, it is intended to make formal arrangements for an effective opposition in the Northern Ireland Assembly.<\/p>  <p>  I met with the then SDLP leader and senior colleagues on 10 September in Government Buildings.  We discussed the situation that obtained at that point and the optimum arrangements to ensure that the talks might have a successful outcome.  I hope to have an opportunity to meet the new SDLP leader, Mr. Colum Eastwood, later this week.<\/p>  <p>  The US Senator, Gary Hart, special envoy of the USA, also made a welcome visit to Government Buildings on 14 October 2015.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I expressed our appreciation for the ongoing interest of President Obama's Administration in Northern Ireland and Senator Hart's personal commitment to it.  We took stock of the situation at that time and agreed to stay in close contact.<\/p>  <p>  I met the Northern Ireland Minister, Ms Arlene Foster, at the Remembrance Sunday ceremony in Enniskillen on 8 November.  We held a brief exchange on the current political situation in Northern Ireland.  I have not yet had the opportunity to meet the new leader of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, Mr. Jeremy Corbyn.<\/p>  <p>  Some questions referred to the UK relationship with the EU.  Ministers and Departments are aware of the strategic risks of a withdrawal by the UK from the EU, including risks for Northern Ireland and the Border region.  We will continue to deepen our analysis and understanding of the issues at stake in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs and other Ministers and senior officials meet their counterparts regularly to discuss the proposals for EU reform and issues that arise for Ireland in that regard.  The cabinet committee on EU affairs is monitoring all relevant matters.  The challenge for us is to play a constructive role in the negotiations that lie ahead.  We are keen to work with the British Government and all our EU partners in that process to find an agreed basis for the UK's continued presence as a member of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the public comments by Mr. Nigel Farage of UKIP.  He has set out his views on the potential impact of the UK leaving the EU on Northern Ireland.  I do not agree with his view that the EU had next to no part in the peace process.  I believe that the EU has been an important, perhaps underestimated, enabler of peace in Northern Ireland.  It was instrumental in facilitating constructive contact and building trust between our Governments to find a political settlement.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this month, I had another meeting with the UK Prime Minister on 9 November in London.  I also addressed the Confederation of British Industry annual conference that day.  I discussed with the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, the UK membership of the EU, a question of major interest to us, including in the Northern Ireland context.  Our conversation focused on his letter to the President of the European Council, Mr. Tusk, and our desire to keep Britain in the EU.  I reiterated my offer of support where possible in the forthcoming process.<\/p>  <p>  The UK Prime Minister attended the CBI annual conference earlier that morning.  In my speech at the conference I set out in some detail the implications for Ireland of a UK vote to withdraw from the EU.  While the Prime Minister and I did not discuss the recent ESRI report in detail, it informed the discussion, as it clearly identifies potential adverse economic risks for Ireland and Northern Ireland in the event of a UK exit from the EU.  We also discussed ongoing progress in key areas of the comprehensive work programme arising from the joint statement of 2012, including trade promotion and co-operation in respect of defence and security matters.  We noted that work continues to be progressed through bilateral contacts between our respective Government officials, including at Secretary General and Permanent Secretary level.  A fourth plenary meeting of this group, which oversees the progress on over 20 areas of co-operation, took place on 1 October this year.  Delivery on commitments in the joint work programme will be reviewed again at the next annual summit meeting, to be held in the spring.  We took stock of the situation regarding the talks in Stormont and the prospect of agreement being reached.  I also raised legacy issues with the Prime Minister.  On the same day, I travelled to Belfast for a meeting with the Northern Ireland First Minister, Mr. Robinson, and Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness.  We discussed the issues in greater detail, including the scope for financial support for certain infrastructure projects with all-island benefits.<\/p><p> We also discussed the measures being negotiated to deal with the unacceptable vestiges of paramilitarism and the corrosive effects of organised crime on both sides of the Border.  We discussed the measures being taken to address the legacy of the past, including mechanisms to ensure that the arrangements agreed in the Stormont House agreement would be made to work for the benefit of survivors, victims and their families.  I took the opportunity to urge the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to ensure that any emerging agreement would have the maximum possible support of other parties.  <\/p> <p> As the House is aware, the talks in Northern Ireland concluded successfully last week.  The agreement addresses the key issues of welfare reform and financial stability within Northern Ireland.  It also makes important progress on dealing with the legacy of the past, albeit that it did not conclude on the full range of issues.  I very much hope that this will be done in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p> The agreement also contains clear commitments to achieve a society free of paramilitarism and to work to disband paramilitary groups.  The agreement contains important measures to tackle cross-Border organised crime, including a new task force led by officials from the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue officers from both jurisdictions.  However, as always, this agreement will ultimately be judged on its implementation.<\/p> <p> The title of the agreement is A Fresh Start, and this is precisely what the people of Northern Island will wish to see.  They deserve not only a fresh start, but a sustained commitment by all of the parties in Northern Ireland to a complete transition of their economy and society.  In my contribution to the British-Irish Association in Cambridge last September, I set out my vision for an island which is defined by optimism, hope and opportunity.  At the heart of that vision are efficient, effective and representative devolved institutions working for the common good on a sustainable basis.  There must also be co-operation to build the island economy through overseas investment, trade, tourism and utilising a competitive common corporation tax rate.<\/p> <p> This is the real work agenda.  It is one that must be processed through the agreed structures and processes that we have now put in place.  In this regard, I am due to be in London for the next meeting of the British-Irish Council on Friday, 27 November.  I will also attend the next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, which was rescheduled because of the ongoing talks and which I hope will take place in early December.  As co-guarantors of the agreements, the Irish and UK Governments will continue to work closely together to further consolidate peace and reconciliation in the North and to further embed peace and the normalisation of politics in Northern Ireland generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400022#U06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448383800,"counter":390,"content":"<p>The questions cover a period beginning from around June and the Taoiseach, in his reply, quite rightly covered the period up to this month, for which I thank him.  However, there is not enough interaction by the Taoiseach and Government on these issues.  I do not necessarily mean with the parties in the North, although that is an important element of the process.  I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock, for their contribution to the ten weeks of talks.  I refer instead to the Taoiseach's interaction with the British Prime Minister.  It is one area with which we have difficulties because, as the Taoiseach reminded me, he is the co-guarantor of the agreement.  The parties in the North have responsibilities and Sinn F&eacute;in has never shied away from facing up to them.<\/p>  <p>  As we know, Peter Robinson has resigned, and I wish him and his family well in the time ahead.  The winning of the agreement was quite an achievement and even though it was the best that was possible at the time, it has not dealt with all of the issues and has not adequately dealt with some others.  I commend Martin McGuinness, our team and others who engaged over the period involved and the months beforehand.<\/p>  <p>  The difference between this and previous agreements - this goes back to the Stormont House Agreement - is that essentially the parties in the North came together.  In this case, that involved Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, which then went to the Governments with proposals, some of which they resisted.  Much of the work that was done over the past two or three weeks involved trying to get the Governments on board.  That should never be the case in terms of our Government, because it should have a different view from that of the British Government.  One would like to think the Irish Government had an ambition or aspiration to be part of a united Ireland and to work with people in the North on a ongoing and daily basis to build harmony, equality and cordiality between everyone who lives on the island.  The British Government has a different national interest in terms of all of these issues.<\/p>  <p>  We have ended up with crisis management and the institutions being periodically on the cusp of collapse.  Of course, there are times when the institutions have been dysfunctional, but that has been because the Northern state and partition are dysfunctional.  Even though it is very frustrating, in particular for those of us who work in the system, it is far better than how things used to be played out on the streets.<\/p>  <p>  If one looks back over the past few weeks, in particular following the killing of Kevin McGuigan and Jock Davison and how that was seized upon by the Ulster Unionist Party, one can consider the response of the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  He said the institutions should be suspended.  What would the outworking of that have been?  The Taoiseach called for the institutions to be adjourned and tried to armlock the SDLP into accepting that.  What would the consequences of that have been?  We have a responsibility to sustain the institutions but they have to deliver. <\/p>  <p>  We do not have a bill of rights or a charter of rights.  A charter of rights would include this State, and I know why we do not have one in the North.  It is because if we had one, people would have legislative entitlements in terms of all of the rights they are currently being denied.  We do not have a civic forum or Acht Na Gaeilge.  There is a refusal by the British to deal with legacy issues.  <\/p>  <p>  We got &euro;834 million to support vulnerable citizens and Professor Eileen Evason will head a panel to figure out the best way to spend that money.  The Government in London is committed to austerity, as is the Irish Government.  Therefore, we will have more difficulties on the economic front in the time ahead.  We got &euro;877 million in additional funding to help a society which is unique in that it is coming out of conflict.  That means we do not have additional domestic water charges or prescription charges.  We have a public health service which is free at the point of delivery.  That is where Sinn F&eacute;in's focus has been.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of legacy issues, will the hooded men have to wait forever?  What about the Ballymurphy families, the family of Pat Finucane, the families connected to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the families of the Miami Showband and Seamus Ludlow's family, who live in my constituency?  Numerous other families have been victims of the IRA and other groups.  <\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach have proposals to get the British Government to stick to what it committed to in various other agreements, not least the Stormont House agreement, which it then breached by introducing legislation?  Its excuse is that national security is involved.  What on earth causes issues of national security when some incidents happened 40, 30 or 20 years ago?<\/p><p>I am looking from the Taoiseach for a more proactive interaction with the Prime Minister and a clear and consistent strategic plan.  I happen to agree with the Taoiseach on the effects of the British withdrawing from the EU, and we can speak about it at some other point if I am allowed back in.  A week or two after we have had this agreement we have other issues, and if they are not dealt with now to be managed in advance, we will have another crisis in the North at some point.  The Taoiseach knows what the problems will be.  Our responsibility is to be problem solvers and solution finders, and to do this now and not wait until everybody is angsty and in a cranky mood or, God forbid, until people are killed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400023#V00200","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448384400,"counter":392,"content":"<p>Deputy Adams has raised a number of interesting points in his contribution.  This morning, the Government noted its appreciation and that of the people of the work carried out by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock.  I agree with Deputy Adams in this regard.  The Government noted this contribution today.<\/p>  <p>  I wish the First Minister, Mr. Robinson, very well on his decision to stand down as leader after a period.  It should be noted that in his role as a public representative over very many years, he was one of the main engines of the various strands of ideas which came about.  He was sometimes provocative, and I commend him and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, on being able to conclude the Stormont House Agreement.  It was not an easy situation for either of them and it is an example of how they faced the responsibilities given to them by the people in respect of the Executive.  From two very contradictory points they were able to work with everybody else to put together the Stormont House Agreement.  While it is not complete and it does not cover all the issues, it is a pretty substantial achievement.  It includes a range of mutually beneficial issues which have not been addressed in the media. Perhaps they might not attract the same level of attention.  The First Minister and Deputy First Minister and the respective parties have put it out there for all others to accept or not as the case might be.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Adams spoke about the Government here having a different view, and we have a different view on a range of things.  We will never have a united Ireland unless we have it by consent, and one of the issues that clearly is of relevance is the management of and state of the economic circumstances that apply North and South.  This is why under the devolution theory the decision to devolve responsibility to the Executive, if it so wishes, to reduce the level of corporation tax to that of the Republic would benefit the economy of the island of Ireland in the time ahead.  We have always gone out of our way, as Deputy Adams is well aware, to bring on board personnel from Northern Ireland on issues the Government here has dealt with abroad, be it during the European Presidency or trade missions.  As he is aware, we had the first tripartite trade mission to Singapore, with Northern Ireland, the British Government and our Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  This is the direction in which we need to be able to proceed to prove to everybody that common sense and effective politics actually work in the people's interests, and the more we have in terms of benefits resulting to Northern Ireland, the better and easier it will be to break down prejudice, particularly for young people who might be in very difficult circumstances because of the legacies of the past or politically, in order that people see there is a genuine way forward around the blockages that have prevented this in the past.  This type of issue is important.<\/p>  <p>  We took a different view in respect of some of the infrastructure projects mentioned by the groupings.  We need a process of preparation for planning and environmental issues.  The Government is happy to make a further allocation in a number of years hence for the completion of the first stage of the A5 from Derry to Strabane, which is of particular interest to the Government here and to Northern Ireland with regard to getting to the north west.<\/p>  <p>  It is true we do not have a bill of rights, a civic forum or Acht na Gaeilge, but surely the reason we are in politics is to be able to put these things out there and follow through on them if possible.  Clearly the situation in the Executive and the Assembly does not allow for the completion of their implementation now.  There is no reason, with the Stormont House Agreement in place and a fresh start, that these issues cannot come into focus again.  I would be very supportive of this.  I take the point on connection with the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron.  We have been in contact as often as needs be.  He has other things in focus at present which occupy his time.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Adams mentioned the legacy of the past and victims, and I noted the comment of the Commissioner for Victims and Survivors, Judith Thompson, on national radio on Sunday.  She indicated that she had invited me, as Taoiseach, and the Prime Minister to engage in a meeting with her.  I checked before I came down and I have not yet received a letter from the Commissioner for Victims and Survivors.  If she has written, it is still in the system or it has not reached me, and I will be very happy to respond when I receive it.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Adams also mentioned a number of other issues, including Justice for the Forgotten in respect of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  We support fully the motions passed in 2008 and 2011 urging the British Government to allow an independent international judicial figure access to all original documents in its possession relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  This is also part of the return of Ireland's most famous rock band at present, regarding a declaration in respect of Justice for the Forgotten.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has raised the issue umpteen times with the British Government, most recently on 8 October.  He has received assurances from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that the British Government is actively considering how it can respond to the D&aacute;il motions.  One of them is seven years old and the other is four years old, and the question is whether there is a willingness to do it.  We continue to push for this and I will raise it again with the Prime Minister.<\/p>  <p>  I have spoken before about Kingsmill.  A particular set of legal issues arose in the process of the preparation of materials for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to transmit to the coroner regarding the inquest into the horrific murders at Kingsmill.  In June this year, the Government identified a way forward which involved making regulations under the Data Protection Act and issuing a directive by the Minister for Justice and Equality under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 which helped to provide a legal mechanism for the transmission by the Garda of the relevant material.  The Government also formally agreed that as much information as possible, in accordance with the law, should be provided to the inquest, and the directive and the regulations have helped the Garda authorities who have made the transfer of relevant materials to the coroner in accordance with the law.  The Garda authorities' co-operation with the Northern Ireland coroner is part of an ongoing legal process, and they will continue to work with the coroner in respect of the inquest.<\/p>  <p>  We also had the motion, as Deputy Adams knows, on Ballymurphy.  The Clerk of the D&aacute;il wrote to the Northern Ireland Assembly and the House of Commons communicating the motion to both legislatures.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has brought the motion directly to the attention of the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Ms Villiers, including at their meeting in September in Dublin, requesting follow-up.  It should be said the Secretary of State reiterated the position, as outlined before by the Prime Minister, that the British Government feels the balance of interest does not lie in favour of creating an independent panel - I am disappointed with this - and that the existing legal procedures, processes and bodies under the Stormont House Agreement are the best means of establishing those facts not already in the public domain.  I regard this as a test of the Stormont House Agreement with regard to dealing with the past because, in theory at least, it provides for an opportunity for an independent person to supply material that has not been provided to persons bereaved or aggrieved over the years.  We will continue to press for an independent panel inquiry, and when it reaches the stage of being a test of the Stormont House Agreement, I hope it measures up.<\/p>  <p>  In the Pat Finucane case we continue to hold the very strong view that an independent public inquiry be established into his murder in line with the commitments entered into in Weston Park.<\/p><p>The British Government has rejected that and we continue to have a serious difference of opinion with it about that.<\/p> <p> With respect to Bloody Sunday of 1972, 14 people were shot dead and there is an ongoing criminal investigation by the PSNI into these murders.  I do not wish to comment on the arrest of a former British soldier in connection with that.  The Saville report and the subsequent apology received has helped Derry to move on and to begin building a brighter future for the citizens of that city.  One never knows, the ongoing PSNI investigation may, I hope, bring the justice demanded by the families and the relatives of those murdered and further assist the healing process.<\/p> <p> For information of the Deputies, I met members of the Omagh support group on 6 October and was accompanied by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  We had a very good discussion with Mr. Gallagher and his delegation, and that followed through in the commitment I gave in Glenties in July that I would meet him.  I assured him that the Government will continue to work with the people of Omagh to pursue every avenue to get to the truth and ensure that those who perpetrated this particular atrocity are brought to justice.  I indicated that the Government would give a full response to all the issues raised in the report submitted to the Government following the conclusion of current criminal proceedings.  These are obviously matters that will not be concluded in the short term but if we can make small steps of progress, demonstrating the honouring of commitments in the interests of truth and reconciliation, it can all be a help in the longer term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400024#W00200","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448385000,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I also welcome that events are not, as one previous speaker noted, being \"played out on the streets\" of Northern Ireland in the way they used to be.  Unfortunately, the agreement signed in Stormont is called A Fresh Start: The Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan but it is not a fresh start for the ordinary people of Northern Ireland.  It is a continuation of the sectarian politics that has dominated the North for decades and it is also an acceleration of austerity in the North.  This merits much discussion and examination for people in the South as well.  For example, it is bad news for working class people as the agreement would implement austerity and a range of cuts in welfare and other departments by the two big parties.  It is also a shifting of the economy more towards profit of multinationals, with a massive cut in corporation tax that has been argued for by the Northern Ireland Assembly.  I make these points for the Taoiseach's comment.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the resignation of Mr. Peter Robinson, he is an example of the type of politician who has been part of the problem in Northern Ireland and not the solution.  He is somebody who has blocked marriage equality most recently, and social progress, colluding with other parties to prevent, for example, women having the right to control their bodies, as the Abortion Act 1967 was not extended to the North.  He stoked up sectarianism not long ago: the flags issue was quite recent and well documented.  Other key parties have space in one community and politics has been reduced to a sectarian head count.  That is still the case.<\/p>  <p>  It is a credit to ordinary working class people, both Catholic and Protestant, that they will not allow the region to go back to the Troubles of the past.  It is worth noting that the trade union movement is still probably the only organisation where Catholic and Protestant people organise together.  I raise the warning that although the Troubles are gone, unfortunately sectarianism has not gone away and there has been an increase in the separation between the two communities.  That is well documented if one visits the North.  We need a new generation of political representatives who will build unity among ordinary people rather than sowing or fomenting division.<\/p>  <p>  The other key element of the Stormont agreement is the massive austerity programme that has been accepted by the parties in the North to be implemented in conjunction with the slashing of corporation tax.  This austerity agreement represents a turning point because lines have been crossed, including by Sinn F&eacute;in.  The party stated it would not cross those lines and that core payments in social welfare would be protected.  It is a warning to those placing hopes in Sinn F&eacute;in in the South for the next election.<\/p>  <p>  Let us call these cuts what they are; we cannot just call them \"reforms\" when it suits.  The welfare cuts that have been agreed for implementation will mean an estimated 20,000 job cuts in the public sector.  It also means benefits will be cut and day centres etc. will close.  The cut in corporation tax equates to another massive hand-out to big business while ordinary people experience cuts in their living standards.  That is the reality of the agreement.  The cushion money being touted of &pound;585 million over four years also has to cushion the effect of tax credits, defence and other areas, so it is not solely to protect people suffering welfare cuts.  The money will last for four years but with the last agreement it was to last for six years.  There is less money in this agreement to bulwark against austerity than there was in the previous agreement.  Northern Ireland workers will also lose &pound;110 million from tax credits being introduced.<\/p>  <p>  This \"fresh start\" includes recommendations for cost reduction targets in nine departments.  It includes the phrase \"structural reforms\" to take place-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400025#X00200","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1448385000,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I must ask the Deputy to finish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400025#X00300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1448385000,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I am just finishing now.

It is a good title and from having met the First Minister, Deputy First Minister and other members of the political spectrum in Northern Ireland, this was particularly challenging for many of them.  The situation evolved and was agreed.  Britain would retain responsibility for welfare but because Northern Ireland is recognised as an economy emerging from conflict, an extra &pound;500 million plus would be made available to deal with top-ups with respect to particular credits.<\/p>  <p>  The best way out of poverty is a job.  An economy in trouble or with reputational damage suffered either by perception or the reality of paramilitarism or criminal activity would not progress as freely as one might wish.  In that sense, the decision taken first by the British Government to devolve authority to the Executive speaks for itself.  It is also an indication of a sense of confidence and belief that the Executive fought for so hard through the Good Friday Agreement and others can work, with the responsibility being given to politicians to make it work, which will have a benefit for Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In our area down here, the figures for corporation tax in 2015 will be the biggest ever, exceeding the &euro;6.7 billion collected way back in 2006.<\/p><p>There are reasons for that, many of which relate to changes in the way this is assessed and paid.  There has also been an increase in opportunity in firms that contribute between &euro;100,000 and &euro;1 million, with an increase of 20% in the numbers down here.  In terms of the island economy, a straight 12.5% corporation tax rate across the board will make the island of Ireland more attractive for investment from abroad.<\/p> <p> In the budget the Minister for Finance brought in the first OECD-compliant patent knowledge box, which is 6.25%, half the corporation tax rate.  That will make the Republic even more attractive for that kind of investment, and I cannot say whether the Northern Ireland Executive will follow suit in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400025#X00700","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448385600,"counter":401,"content":"<p>First, I join others in wishing the Northern Ireland First Minister, Peter Robinson, the very best in his retirement.  I dealt with him in my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and negotiated with him in the context of the devolution of justice and related matters over a three-year period.  In many instances I found him straight up in negotiations, although he came from a difficult position, dealing with many difficult strands within his own community and party and facing many challenges as a result.  Throughout his career, he also went on a journey and changed from a strong hardline position in the earlier part of his career to a position where he brought the DUP into the Northern Ireland Executive and into the broader agreement and peace process.<\/p>  <p>  On the fresh start agreement, as it is called, we all hope it is not a false start and I am somewhat concerned about Deputy Adams's remarks that, before we know it, there will be another crisis if certain things are not done.  That is what upsets much of the middle ground in Northern Ireland, the sense that it is going from one crisis to another and they are becoming immune to it at this stage in terms of the stop-start nature of the operation of the Executive and the Assembly.  Deputy Adams can go into semantics, but essentially the Executive was not working for the past while.  One can say it was adjourned or call it what one likes, but it was not working because there was a crisis.  The crisis was not caused by political parties.  Two men were murdered.  The PSNI made a judgment in terms of the links of the murders to paramilitaries and in particular to the Provisional IRA.  We did not make that link and we did not seize on that.

It belongs to the people of Ireland.  A number of aspects of the agreement would concern people.  The financial package does not quite add up and there is a bit of play going on in terms of changing six years to four years and taking money from one department to fund another department.  In fact, in some respects, the package is less if one looks at the contraction in the number of years.  There is a bit of kicking the can down the road in terms of the finances.  Would the Taoiseach accept that?  Even financing the corporation tax reduction will be left to the Executive.  In terms of the welfare package, other departments will have to cough up and there will have to be cuts in other departments.<\/p>  <p>  Of more interest, and I would ask whether the Taoiseach agrees with this, is that for some reason Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, in an extraordinary Machiavellian manoeuvre, have given power over welfare back to Westminster whereby, without even debate in the Assembly, a motion is passed which says the welfare cuts and the welfare reform package are to be decided in Westminster.  The Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, was adamant for the past year that there could be no rowing back on or reversal of devolution.  He said it would be unacceptable, but in essence welfare powers have been taken back by London in respect of this package.  I do not know whether that is to facilitate Sinn F&eacute;in, to spare its blushes and to make it look better, as if it is not doing this but merely facilitating someone else in doing it.  That is a very interesting aspect of the agreement and I would like some explanation as to how that came about.

I asked him questions about the UUP and the SDLP and his meetings with them.  That has been a consistent view of theirs, that they effectively have been squeezed out by the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in in terms of any decisions taken by the Executive, that they are the last to know and that certain memos are frozen or do not get circulated.  That has really undermined the working of the Executive.  That has been a long-running saga.

Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP orchestrated that the Alliance Party, not the SDLP, would get the justice portfolio.

It is the Northern Ireland version of the troika assault that was imposed on people here over the past six years and it would better be described as a fresh offensive against the poor and working people in the North rather than some sort of fresh start.

When I met the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, I encouraged them to bring in the SDLP so that they could brief that party on the developments that were taking place at the talks, both under the auspices of the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Secretary of State.  The UUP, with its leader, Mr. Nesbitt, has stated it is going into opposition but that does not mean it should not be informed of what is happening.  The SDLP, which was in a slightly different position, was welcoming in principle of many of the issues and was opposed to others.  While I did not advise them, I certainly encouraged the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to do that and not have drift between the parties.  I take Deputy Martin's point.<\/p>  <p>  I felt that if one is now going to have a different system that applies across the United Kingdom, then the question is whether one accepts responsibility to deal with welfare in the first place.  The decision was taken by the politicians - it was not our strand to deal with - that this should be based in London and the extra &pound;500 million was given as a consequence to deal with an economy emerging from conflict.  In respect of the past, it was always going to come down to that at the end of the day.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Stormont House Agreement and Fresh Start be able to deal with the legacies of the past and will the historic unit - the independent person - be able to have access to material that is currently off limits?

That is because there are more firms now paying tax.

It is ironic that this debate is taking place a day after Kildare County Council decided to scrap a section 38 proposal that would have changed the traffic pattern in Celbridge and that would have had implications for a number of residential estates in the town.  The bridge in Celbridge was built after a flood in 1802.  It has been in existence as the town has developed over the past 200 years to its current size with a population of almost 20,000.  The problem in the town is that there is just one bridge over the River Liffey.  This restricts access from one side of the town to the other.  It makes it difficult for many people to avail of the very good public transport links that are provided at Hazelhatch railway station.  I commend the Minister on today's announcement of investment in the DART and Luas networks.  It is very difficult for public transport operators to get through the village at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  Seven options were set out in a report that was produced for RPS Consultants on behalf of Kildare County Council in June.  The option that was favoured by a local Fianna F&aacute;il councillor caused fierce consternation in the town.  I am delighted that the public realised what was happening.  The proposed route would have gone through the Simmonstown and Hazelhatch Park estates.  Traffic would have been diverted onto a road that has a public play area on one side and housing on the other.  Kids who wanted to cross that road to get to the area where they normally play would not have had a proper junction or crossing point to use.  I thought it was absolutely crazy.  I am delighted that as soon as the period of time for public submissions was completed, Kildare County Council made a rapid decision not to go ahead with the section 38 proposal.  The proposal in question was one of the options put forward by RPS Consultants when they were asked to suggest ways of improving the traffic flow in Celbridge.<\/p>  <p>  A second bridge is needed in the town of Celbridge.  Most of us who have gone through the town of Enniscorthy have seen the helpful one-way flow system there, which uses two bridges in close proximity to each other.  A second bridge in the centre of Kilkenny is helping to alleviate the traffic problems associated with the town.  I accept that such a venture in Celbridge would cost between &euro;8 million and &euro;10 million.  We need to put plans in place now for the development of something like this in the long term.  I believe we can bring the public on board with the proposed second bridge if a long-term strategy is put in place.  It was proposed to develop a second bridge from Castletown to Donaghcumper, but that was unacceptable because it would have been too close to the gates of historic Castletown House.  That made no sense at all.  I believe that if we put a plan in place, engage in proper public consultation and get the people on board, we can develop a second bridge in the village of Celbridge, which is wanted to ease the traffic flows that are there at the moment.  If there is a better flow of traffic through the town, people will be more likely to use the public transport options that are available in Celbridge, including those provided through CIE and Dublin Bus at the railway station in Hazelhatch.  I hope we can start a long-term process that will lead to the construction of a second bridge in Celbridge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400029#BB00300","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1448387400,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lawlor for raising this matter.  As he is aware, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in County Kildare is the statutory responsibility of Kildare County Council in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Work on such roads is funded from the council&rsquo;s own resources, supplemented by allocations made directly from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the council.  Ireland has just under 100,000 km of roads in its network.  The maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a significant financial burden on local authorities and the Exchequer.  Due to the national financial position, there have been large reductions in the amount of Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure over recent years.  Funding for the national, regional and local road network was &euro;2.3 billion in 2008, but it is just &euro;760 million this year.  In light of the challenging financial climate, the specific improvement grants scheme was curtailed to maximise the funding available for repair and strengthening work.  It is important to reiterate that the purpose of Exchequer funding is to supplement the resources of each local authority.  I have been emphasising to local authorities the importance of prioritising expenditure on roads when they are allocating their own resources, including local property tax receipts.  The capital plan that will run from 2016 to 2021 provides for a gradual build-up in capital funding for the road network towards the levels that are needed to support maintenance and improvement works.  The primary focus in the next few years will continue to be on road maintenance and renewal rather than new projects.<\/p>  <p>  I announced the 2015 regional and local road allocations on 3 February last.  Some &euro;10.7 million was allocated to Kildare County Council.  The council received an additional &euro;799,900 in restoration improvement funding in July of this year.  All available funding for this year has now been allocated.  I am aware that Kildare County Council has published a document, Feasibility Report for River Crossings of the River Liffey and Associated Traffic Management Requirements in Celbridge, that was prepared for it by RPS Consultants.  I believe that is the report to which Deputy Lawlor has referred.  I understand that the council commissioned this study to explore river crossing options and traffic management arrangements that could alleviate traffic congestion in Celbridge and that the report identifies short-term traffic management options and a longer-term new river crossing option for further study and evaluation.  Local authorities are aware that it is a matter for each council to determine its priorities and to allocate funding accordingly.  Therefore, it is a matter for Kildare County Council to decide how best to address the findings of this report and to allocate its own resources to the further evaluation of options if it considers that appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400029#BB00400","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1448387400,"counter":474,"content":"<p>The report was welcomed in so far as it put options into the public domain.

I appreciate that we need to take a long-term view in this regard as the economy improves.  I do not envisage that Kildare County Council will be able to afford to put a new bridge in place on its own, but it might be able to do so with the assistance of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I remind the House that the feasibility study was funded by the National Transport Authority.  I suggest that if we work jointly on a long-term basis, we might be able to find a solution for the town of Celbridge which is choked by traffic at the moment.

I am relieved to have the opportunity to raise the matter with the Minister following months of back and forth with his office and with officials from his Department.  Unfortunately, I have got nowhere.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is failing farmers with learning disabilities and literacy problems who wish to be registered as professional users under the sustainable use of pesticides directive by way of statutory instrument SI 155 of 2012.  I have been contacted by a farmer within my constituency who has been told that he cannot avail of the highest accredited course under one of the bodies which the Department has tasked with providing the appropriate training because he suffers from severe dyslexia.  The farmer was informed by representatives of the training body that he would not be able to participate in the course as he was not capable of reading the instructions on the labels on the back of the pesticide canister.  This farmer assures me that he is just one of many others who feel marginalised and discriminated against as a result of the Minister's inability to address this issue appropriately.<\/p>  <p>  I wrote to the Minister regarding the matter in early September and received the following reply, \"As part of the quality assurance accreditation of every provider by the awarding bodies, QQI and City &amp;amp; Guilds in this case, there is an undertaking to make skills\/competency-based courses, such as those required by DAFM for the registration of professional users, accessible to all.\"  This should include people suffering like my client.<\/p>  <p>  In fairness to the Minister, he did say he had been in contact with three providers who indicated that the necessary supports would be put in place following consultation and agreement with the individual concerned.  However, the providers cited in his response are not the preference of the farmer who wishes to participate in a top accredited City &amp;amp; Guilds course under Kearney Training &amp;amp; Consultancy.  Why should he not be given the opportunity to participate in the best course available?  Why can he not be facilitated?  Students with similar learning disabilities are facilitated with audio facilities when taking their State examinations.  Why can the instructions on the pesticide canisters not be provided in audio form?  This would get this man over the hill.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, referred me to an official within his Department with the purpose of ensuring that participation would be facilitated for this farmer.  There was no urgency in dealing with my queries and, as we speak, we are two days out from the deadline of 26 November and I am no better off than when I started.  This man and many others have met roadblock after roadblock in their attempts to gain top accreditation, and this is as a result of having learning disabilities or literacy difficulties.  Why should this man, and many others in the same situation, have to settle for a lesser qualification?  This is a man who has been farming for his whole life and has more than 45 years' experience of working with pesticides and associated dispensers.  He probably has more knowledge in this area of agriculture than the so-called experts who have deemed him ineligible to take part in this course and gain a full qualification.<\/p>  <p>  There are only four days left to look at this man's situation.  He came to me at the cow mart a couple of months ago and told me he suffered from dyslexia.  He cannot read the canisters at the moment so he cannot take this course because of the rules and regulations.  If we can provide audio facilities for students, why can we not do the same for a man who makes his living in this way?  It is his business, and his income will be severely hit unless he can get accreditation.  Will the Minister look at the case of this individual and give him time to get accreditation because we are close to the deadline?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400030#CC00400","speaker":"1199"},{"type":"speech","time":1448388000,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Aylward for raising this case.  The individual concerned was not mentioned in the question.  I did not realise the Deputy's question was specific to one person but we may look at his particular case.<\/p>  <p>  The sustainable use of pesticides directive establishes a framework for community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides.  It aims to fill the current legislative gap regarding the use phase of pesticides at EU level through setting minimum rules for the use of pesticides in the community to reduce risks to human health and the environment.  It also promotes the use of integrated pest management.<\/p>  <p>  Implementation of the sustainable use of pesticides directive relies heavily on the training of the various people involved at all levels of the industry, including pesticide advisers, pesticide distributors, professional users and inspectors of pesticide application equipment.  A new programme to test all pesticide application equipment is also being put in place.  Bearing in mind the potentially toxic nature of pesticides, the need for appropriate training must be viewed in the context of protecting both human health and the environment and, in particular, maintaining the high quality of our water.  The risk associated with the use of pesticides is related to the properties of the product itself and not to either the quantity used or the frequency of use.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the quality assurance accreditation of every provider by the various awarding bodies, there is an undertaking to make skills-based courses, such as those required by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for the registration of professional users, accessible to all.  The Department has worked with a wide variety of service providers, including Teagasc, City &amp;amp; Guilds and FETAC, to ensure participants who have completed relevant pesticide application courses will meet the requirements for professional user training.  In addition, an individual who has completed a pesticide application module equivalent to one of the Department's recognised qualifications as part of their certificate in agriculture or other award is not required to undertake any further training to register as a professional user.  A list of training providers for professional pesticides users is available on the Department's website.<\/p>  <p>  All plant protection products are classified as either professional or non-professional. Labels indicate to which category a product belongs and the status of a product may be checked on the Department's website.  Non-professional or amateur plant protection products can continue to be used in the home or garden situation and are approved for such purposes.  There are no restrictions on the use of such products and there is no requirement for such users to be trained or registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  These products are most likely to be found in the local garden centre, DIY store or supermarket.<\/p><p>It should be emphasised that 26 November 2015 is simply the official start date for the new regulations.  The sustainable use of pesticides directive requires all professional users, namely, anybody who applies or sprays products authorised for professional use, to be trained and registered as a professional user with the Department by 26 November, regardless of the quantity or method of application.  Therefore, only registered professional users can spray professional use products after this date and there is an obligation on an individual to be appropriately trained as a professional user and registered with the Department before he or she may apply or spray professional plant protection products in order to be compliant with the provisions of the sustainable use directive.  In practice, however, only those individuals who intend to apply plant protection products authorised for professional use immediately after 26 November will be required to have completed their training and registration.  The vast majority of individuals who will not apply plant protection products until the spring or summer of 2016 will have some further time to be trained and registered.  However, they must meet this requirement before they apply or spray professional plant protection products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400030#CC00500","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448388600,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

As a result of the lack of urgency displayed by departmental officials, he is likely to be penalised for engaging in this type of work when the deadline passes on Thursday next.  Is the business of the man in question being placed at risk because he has dyslexia?  I am not asking questions about the scheme, which is perfectly in order.  As a farmer, I accept it and I know that either I or my son will have to complete the course if either of us wishes to use pesticide sprays in future.  The person who raised this matter with me suffers from a disability, namely, dyslexia.  Why will the Department not facilitate him by affording him the same rights as are afforded to everyone else?  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State's reply was fine in so far as it related to the pesticides directive.  I am asking about an individual who cannot obtain the accreditation on which his business depends and who will lose money this year if he is penalised or prevented from making a living from spraying pesticides.  I ask the Department to address this issue, rather than the implementation of the scheme.  The issue is one of access for the individual in question and others who are in the same position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400031#DD00200","speaker":"1199"},{"type":"speech","time":1448388600,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that the Deputy has accepted the need for the directive.

The school transport system is based solely on providing transport to the nearest resourced school.  While it works reasonably well for most students, unfortunately it is detrimental to some students with special needs and disabilities who attend special schools as it does not take account of their medical needs or the support services they require.  The problem is particularly difficult in areas such as Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary as the Department insists that students with special needs from the Carrick-on-Suir area attend school in Waterford city.  This issue has been raised with the Department on numerous occasions.<\/p>  <p>  School transport has been refused, including on appeal, and I appeal to the Minister to address the issue as it is particularly difficult for students and parents.  The problem is that, since birth, special needs students have been availing of services in County Tipperary and have built up relationships with the services and their staff.  For instance, many have been visiting paediatric consultants, medical, nursing, psychological, physiotherapy, social work and speech and language therapy staff in Tipperary.  In some cases, they have attended preschool services in Tipperary.  All of these services are available in two special schools in Cashel, Scoil Aonghusa and Scoil Chormaic, where they are provided by a multidisciplinary team.  They are of great benefit to the students and provide families with great support.<\/p>  <p>  If the students are forced to attend school in Waterford, they will have to be taken out of school to travel to Tipperary to visit the paediatric consultant, psychologist, physiotherapist, social workers and speech and language therapists with whom they have built up a relationship.  All these services are based in Tipperary.  It will be traumatic for the children who avail of these services if they are forced to leave the county to attend a school Waterford, which is excellent, and have to travel back to the county to access the services they require as a result of their disabilities.  This does not make sense and will be traumatic and costly for the children in question and their families.<\/p><p>Will the Minister to look at this very seriously and amend the scheme?  A small number of students are affected by it and it could be addressed at little to no cost.  In fact, it would probably cost nothing to amend the scheme to include these students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400031#DD00900","speaker":"960","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448389200,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Healy for raising the matter.  The Department of Education and Skills provides for the education of children with special educational needs through a number of support mechanisms and placement options depending on the child's assessed needs.  In general, education provision for children with special educational needs is made in special schools, special classes attached to ordinary schools or in integrated settings in mainstream classes.<\/p>  <p>  I am not sure what wording the Deputy used.  I only have the wording I have here as to the debate he raised which was on services in general.  I understand that the issue was discussed at a public meeting last night and that there was a support locally from other Deputies on the issue.  The Deputy did not clarify, however, what wording was different from what he submitted.<\/p>  <p>  While departmental policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special educational needs into ordinary mainstream schools, students who have been assessed as having special educational needs also have access to a range of special schools or class placements.  Special educational needs organisers, or SENOs, from the National Council for Special Education, or NCSE, can assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.  The NCSE has published a guide for parents and guardians on choosing schools for children and young people with special educational needs.  The guide is available at the council's website.<\/p>  <p>  The Department's policy on school transport is that transport is provided to the nearest school which can be resourced to provide education for the child, taking into account any recommendation made about the type of educational provision that is recommended for the child, whether special school placement, special class placement or mainstream placement with additional resources.  The pertinent recommendation for consideration for school transport is the recommendation by the NCSE as to which is the nearest school which can be resourced to cater for the educational needs of the particular child taking into account the type of placement recommended in professional reports.  The role of the NCSE is to advise parents on the educational and other resources which can be provided to allow a child to attend school.  The availability and provision of health related services, including therapy supports, which is the issue that was raised, is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  The Department of Education and Skills has no responsibility or mandate for such services.  The availability of therapy services in a particular school is not, therefore, a factor which is taken into account by the NCSE in designating which is the nearest school placement which can be resourced to meet the educational needs of a particular child.  I understand that therein lies the Deputy's problem.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the situation the Deputy is trying to raise is the difference between the services provided by the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health and decisions made in the latter as well.  I stress, however, that the rules around school transport are designed and implemented nationally.  I have to ensure they are implemented fairly across the board.  In circumstances such as those the Deputy has raised in respect of a particular school, it can be difficult when different Departments provide different services.  In light of that, a health and education steering committee has been established to progress the national programme on progressing disability services for children and young people.  The programme is based on the recommendations of the report of the national reference group on multidisciplinary services for children aged five to 18 years which was produced by representatives of the professions and management involved in delivering multidisciplinary services to children.  The long-term goal of the programme is to bring consistency to therapy service delivery and a clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need.  The implementation of the programme will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children requiring access to health related supports regardless of where they live or which schools they attend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400032#EE00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1448389200,"counter":489,"content":"<p>The difficulty I am trying to raise is set out towards the end of the Minister of State's reply.  The nub of the question is the absence of communication or connections between the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health on transport services for children with disabilities where the resourced school is not in the area where the services have been provided to the particular child since birth.  That is the key problem.  The Minister of State has acknowledged that there is no communication between the two.  To be fair to these students and their families, communication is needed between the Departments and the scheme must be amended to take into account the medical and support service needs of children with disabilities where they have established a relationship with those services and with the individuals providing those services in their own county.  It is nonsense to have them attend school in Waterford city and have them brought back regularly from school to Tipperary to attend psychology services, speech and language, paediatric services and physiotherapy services.  All these services are available in south Tipperary in special schools that provide an excellent service.  It is time the Departments of Education and Skills and Health got together to ensure the scheme was amended to allow for the small number of cases we are talking about.  These are cases that are highly traumatic for the children and traumatic and pressurising for families.

The solution regarding a combination of services provided through the Department of Education and Skills and the Department and Health is not really a school transport one.  I have sympathy for the issue.  It is something I have been involved in before in other scenarios.  Other cases were brought to me where we have tried to work with the Department of Health to find solutions.  Solutions have generally been found.

The difficulty for my Department is that we do not get involved in the provision of health related services.  That is a matter for the Department of Health, as I think the Deputy acknowledges.

It not only impacts on the rural parts of south Kildare but also is an issue throughout the country.  I thank the Minister for attending to address the matter personally.  I start by acknowledging the role the Minister and his Department have played in addressing the structural deficit in certain parts of Ireland outside the larger urban areas and the deficiency in certain areas which lack high-speed broadband.  I acknowledge in particular the recent capital programme of State expenditure which is the first in which we have seen significant direct Exchequer funding for broadband provision.  Normally, capital plans cover only schools, hospitals, physical buildings and roads, but this is a real recognition that broadband, which is perhaps invisible, is equally important infrastructure for the State.  The money is required for the Minister to do his job because this is very frustrating for those who have not benefited from high-speed broadband.  I have been frustrated by the amount of time that has been wasted in the past and the years of underinvestment in this area.<\/p>  <p>  I raise this matter today because it is timely to do so.  A year ago today, the Minister published the national high-speed coverage map for 2016 which marked out areas in blue and amber depending on whether they were going to get commercial high-speed broadband from the private sector or needed State-led intervention.<\/p><p>I note from recent responses by the Minister to parliamentary questions that his Department intends to publish an updated version of the map before the end of the year and hopes to proceed to formal procurement, which would be welcome.  The updated map will take account of details relating to proposed new commercial investments that have been unveiled during the year.<\/p> <p> I have concerns about specific areas in my constituency, including Narraghmore, Calverstown, Kilmeage, Brannockstown and Maganey, which were marked in amber on the Minister's map one year ago and were due for State-led intervention.  Subsequently, they were included in Eircom's fibre broadband roll-out plan last June.  This was met with much local enthusiasm, as something was finally going to happen.  However, despite my repeated requests of eir, as it is now known, I have been unable to get a clear timeframe for this.  That worries me.  I am afraid that those areas will be excluded from the updated version of the map of State-led intervention that the Minister is about to publish because we will not have a commitment from the private sector on when it will invest in broadband.<\/p> <p> We must ensure that an area that has been removed from the map is not adversely affected by a delay.  Private operators may try a land grab, take as many areas from the State as they can and stockpile business for themselves in the years to come without being held to clear timelines for roll-outs.  Will the Minister assure me that the areas removed from the State intervention map will receive high-speed broadband roll-outs in a shorter timeframe or, at the very least, in the same amount of time as those areas covered by the map?  Other areas in my constituency, such as Moone, Allenwood, Ballitore and Ballymore Eustace, were included in previous Eircom plans but are still awaiting commencement.<\/p> <p> As the Minister knows, broadband is no longer a luxury.  It is a daily necessity for most adults and children.  It is used for work, education and social purposes and is one of the first services that we look to when moving to new premises.  It is crucial that we get this process right.  Before the Minister publishes a new map and we move to procurement, we should have clear commitments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400032#EE00600","speaker":"949","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448389800,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I agree with him on the importance of broadband infrastructure.  He was correct in that, when we traditionally spoke about infrastructure, we meant physical infrastructure like roads and other big-ticket infrastructure that was important to a modern economy.  Now, though, we must speak of the digital infrastructure.  Broadband is at the centre of that.  The Deputy was right to lay emphasis on the necessary digital infrastructure for our economy.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's national broadband plan is delivering high-speed broadband to every citizen and business in Ireland.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by telecoms operators and a proposed State intervention where the commercial sector will not invest.  The high-speed broadband map that I published last year provides detailed information on commercial investment areas and the proposed intervention area.  It covers more than 50,000 townlands in every county, including Kildare.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that high-speed broadband services have been rolled out to more than 55,000 premises in County Kildare to date, with more than 12,500 more expected to be served by commercial investment by the end of 2016.  Approximately 20,500 remaining premises in Kildare will either be covered by further commercial investment or will be targets for proposed State intervention.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's proposed broadband intervention strategy, which I published on 15 July, sets out a series of detailed proposals by the Government in respect of the proposed State intervention.  Some 41 submissions have been received arising from the recent public consultation on the draft intervention strategy.  These are being carefully considered with a view to finalising the strategy by the end of this year, as the Deputy mentioned.  A detailed procurement process will then be undertaken in order to select a potential bidder or bidders in line with all EU and national legislative requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is determined to ensure that the network is built out as quickly as possible, and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be delivered within three to five years of the contract's award.  Following this process, 85% of premises in Ireland will have access to high-speed services by 2018, with the balance having services by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that I am alive to the issues that he has raised.  However, it is too soon to say precisely how the announcements by eir and other operators this year will impact on the cost to the State of funding our intended intervention.  Detailed examination and analysis of all commercial proposals are continuing.  I expect to be in a position to make a final decision on them by December, when I intend to publish a revised national high-speed broadband coverage map showing commercial investment out to 2020 and a potentially revised intervention area.<\/p>  <p>  The detailed scrutiny that the Deputy would expect us to apply to all commercial plans and undertakings is ongoing and is quickly nearing a conclusion.

Can I take it from him that just because a commercial operator claims it will look after an extra 300,000 households, as was the case with last June's announcement, the Department will not take that at face value?  Can he confirm that there will be detailed scrutiny and that an area that was to receive State-led intervention will not necessarily be knocked off the list unless the Department can be assured of a swifter roll-out of broadband that is at least of equal quality?  If so, I will be greatly reassured.  It is important that my constituents know whether that will be the case.<\/p>  <p>  State-led intervention is the right approach where there is commercial failure.  Previous Governments were happy to sit back and leave this to the private sector, which has given us a patchwork map of broadband across the country.  Obviously, the commercial sector was always going to look after large urban areas first because they had more customers and larger returns were possible, which meant that small areas such as villages and one-off houses in rural areas were left behind.  We have been left another mess to clean up, as we must ensure that everyone gets equal access and the commercial sector does not get the jump on us.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, I surveyed a large number of constituents in my area about the effect on them of a lack of broadband.  It brought home to me the positive impact that a change would have.  We are a little more than one hour from Dublin.  A number of my constituents could work from home a couple of days per week, not clog up the roads, have a better quality of life and be at home at 5:30 p.m. instead of 8 p.m.  That is not even to mention children who want to study or do projects online, the possibility of watching television on the Internet, etc.  Small businesses must be located in towns because people do not have sufficient broadband speeds to set up at home.  For Ireland to develop a more even spread of our economy so that the economic recovery is not urban-centred, broadband is necessary.

That is a factor that we must all be conscious of, but it is not the only one.  When we assess what we are being told, we look behind mere assertion.  That is the point of an assessment process.

USC rate bands for employees are divided equally across the year, assuming a 52-week and a 26-fortnight year.  However, a calendar year consists of 52 weeks and one day, or 52 weeks and two days in a leap year.  As a result, once every five or six years for weekly paid employees, the additional day will be a payday, resulting in 53 paydays falling within the calendar year.  Similarly, once every ten or 12 years, a fortnight 27 arises for fortnightly-paid employees.  As no USC rate bands remain for that year, the full amount of the pay is liable to higher rates of USC, resulting in a lower net income for the employee in that week or fortnight.<\/p><p>The same issue arises for income tax purposes.  The regulations provide for an additional set of credits and rate bands to be allowed in a week-53 or fortnight-27 year.  This amendment will bring the application of USC into line with that of income tax, ensuring employees do not see a reduction in net pay as a result of the date on which their salary is paid.  The amendment also ensures that those who are exempt from USC due to low income do not become liable solely as a consequence of having an additional payday in a year.  It similarly provides that those who benefit from the exemption from the higher rate of USC, including those over 70 and medical card holders whose income does not exceed &euro;60,000, will not inadvertently become liable at the full rate of USC as a consequence of the additional payday within the calendar year.<\/p><p>These amendments will come into effect for the current year, which means

<\/i>shall come into operation on 1 January 2016.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>This amendment introduces a new section 15 to the Bill, which amends section 97 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, relating to the rules applying to the computation of rental profits.  The purpose of the new section 15 is to give legislative effect to the tax relief measure for landlords that was announced as part of the package of measures and reforms to the private rental sector announced jointly by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and me earlier this month.  The aim of this package of reforms is to support housing supply and provide rent stability for both tenants and landlords.  Deputies will be aware that the deduction against rental profits of interest on borrowings used to purchase, improve or repair a residential rental property has been restricted for several years now to 75% of the relevant interest incurred.  With a view to incentivising landlords to rent or to continue to rent their properties to tenants in receipt of social housing supports, I am providing for the reinstatement of the full 100% interest deduction where the landlord undertakes, for a period of at least three years, to provide accommodation to such tenants and registers such undertakings with the Private Residential Tenancies Board within certain time limits.<\/p><p>The social housing supports involved include rent supplement, payable by the Department of Social Protection, and the housing assistance payment and rental accommodation scheme, which are administered by certain local authorities.  The landlord will be able to avail of the increase in interest deductions from 75% to 100% after the end of the three-year undertaking and where other conditions have been fulfilled.  It will be provided on a retrospective basis in that the additional annual 25% deduction for the three-year period will be rolled up and allowed as a deduction against rental profits in year four.  This will be in addition to the 75% interest reduction that will be available to the landlord in year four in the normal way.<\/p><p>The new scheme includes a sunset clause specifying 31 December 2019 as the latest date by which a three-year undertaking period to rent to social housing support tenants can commence.  The aim is to encourage landlords to buy into the scheme as early as possible so that they may be in a position to commit to a second three-year period and avail of a second tranche of additional rolled-up interest reduction.  In essence, a landlord will be able to avail of the scheme for a maximum period of six years, but this will be the case only where the first three-year undertaking is commenced not later than the end of 2016.<\/p><p>The legislation includes provisions to ensure a landlord will not necessarily lose the additional interest reduction if, say, a tenant ceases to qualify for social housing supports or a tenancy in respect of a social housing tenant ceases before the three-year commitment period ends.  This caters for cases where a relevant tenant might find employment during the period of the tenancy, for example.<\/p> <p> Landlords can evaluate what is on offer from this scheme and decide if the expected rate of return from availing of the scheme in terms of tax savings outweighs the expected rate of return in the form of potential additional rents for remaining outside.  Obviously, the additional interest reduction is unlikely to have any impact on those landlords with little or no borrowings.  However, it must be remembered that 70% of landlords have outstanding debt on their property and therefore could benefit from the measure.<\/p> <p> I would not for a moment suggest that this incentive will, on its own, solve the current crisis affecting the rental sector in so far as tenants seeking accommodation with the aid of social housing supports are concerned.  However, I am convinced it will help in some way as part of the overall package of measures that have been introduced by the Government to tackle the problems being observed in the housing market.<\/p> <p> I commend the amendment to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400034#GG01100","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448391000,"counter":509,"content":"<p>The amendment is quite detailed and runs to four pages, so it requires some analysis.  I know it flows from the joint package announced by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and his ministerial colleague, Deputy Kelly.  The backdrop to this is the fact that there simply is little or no availability for tenants who are dependent on State support, including rent supplement and the housing assistance payment.  They find it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to access rental accommodation not just in Dublin but throughout the country because it is now a landlord's market.  Landlords can, in effect, choose the type of tenant they want to sign up for a lease.<\/p><p>It remains to be seen what effect this amendment will have.  I do not believe it will have any impact on supply, nor is the Government suggesting it will.  What it may do, however, is divert some accommodation in the private rental sector from tenants who are not dependent on State supports to those who are.  As we know, many of those people are ending up in emergency accommodation, especially in Dublin but elsewhere as well.<\/p><p>Perhaps the Minister can clarify the issue in paragraph (<i>c<\/i>) where there is a pre-existing lease in place prior to 1 January 2016.  If my reading of this is correct, that lease should be deemed to be a qualifying lease on 1 January.  Does the landlord need to renew or roll on that lease to benefit from the additional taxation relief which is provided for in this amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400035#HH00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1448391000,"counter":510,"content":"<p>To put it simply, this is a tax break for landlords.  This is a long and detailed amendment.  If it is being included to strong-arm landlords somehow or coax them to make it more beneficial to rent to people in receipt of rent supplement, I do not think it will have that effect.  Surely it would have been far better to stamp out the practice, common with landlords, of refusing to take on tenants who are on rent supplement.  They are doing so for a number of reasons.  One is that in some areas they can get a higher rent from tenants who are not in receipt of rent supplement.  That is because the rent supplement caps are so low.  The amount set by the Department of Social Protection that one is allowed to rent for does not bear any resemblance to the price in the local rental housing market.<\/p><p>The other reason is that many landlords are not registered with the PRTB.  That is the problem and therefore they will not take tenants or prospective tenants who are in receipt of State support for their rent.  That is the bigger issue because I think this will miss the target.  It is a bit like the rent control proposal.  The latest report on the rental market from <i>daft.ie <\/i>shows that prices jumped by 3.2% in the last three-month period that is available to us.  That is the biggest jump since 2007 and one could say it was in anticipation of the proposals that came two weeks ago.<\/p><p>Has the proposed measure been costed?  If so, how much will it cost the Exchequer?  Would it not have been better to channel what it will cost the Exchequer, whatever figure that may be, into the social housing budget for the construction of local authority houses?  I know the Government inherited an economy that was in bad shape, but there have been only 1,270 local authority house completions since 2011.  One must compare that with the 1992 to 1996 period, when a Government of which the Minister was a member was in power, when 10,600 such houses were built.  In the five years from 1997 to 2002, 15,900 were completed.  In the 2003 to 2007 period, there were 21,000 social house completions.  The figure over the past four years has been very small.  Surely that is where the problem is in the housing market.  I do not like referring to the housing market, however, because we are talking about people's homes.<\/p><p>If we are trying to do something about housing, it should be noted that the shortfall is in the supply of social housing.  If there were more social housing, there would not be as many people in receipt of rent supplement trying to rent from private landlords.  In addition, the amendment misses the target.  We should be looking at legislation to try to stop the practice of landlords refusing to accept tenants in receipt of rental subsidies for the reasons I have outlined.  That is what we should be doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400035#HH00300","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1448391000,"counter":511,"content":"<p>We are dealing with the bitter fruit of the Government's abysmal failure to deal with the housing crisis over the past four years.  There has been spectacular inaction by the Government as well as misguided policies, most notably the decision in the summer of 2011, months after the Government took office, to instruct local authorities that council housing construction was to cease for the foreseeable future.  We are now faced with an emergency due to that policy failure.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently, a lunatic proposition was made by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, when she cut rent allowance in 2012.  She claimed it would lead to rents going down.  I remember laughing, more fearfully than humorously, at her confident claims that reducing rent allowance would see rents fall.  That is what she said.  It was the most extraordinary misjudgment imaginable when one considers the consequences of rents subsequently going through the roof.   It led directly to a homelessness emergency.  It is not something the Minister for Finance simply inherited.  He certainly inherited a mess, but he compounded that mess at every hand's turn with the policy decisions he made.<\/p>  <p>  Faced with this catastrophe, the answer is tax breaks for landlords.  It is quite extraordinary.<\/p><p>Faced with this suggestion, we are in the invidious position of knowing that in the absence of a major council house construction programme, which the Minister is not promising and which, despite all the trumpeting of announcements here, there and everywhere, is not actually happening, the total capital budget for social housing as against money going on leasing arrangements, rent allowance, housing assistance payments and so on is small.  The capital budget for physical council house construction is &euro;360 million, approximately the same as it was in 2006 when we already had a major problem.  At approximately &euro;100,000 per house, the figure corresponds to 3,600 houses.  We were speaking to the relevant Minister today and he admitted that the number will be far less than that.  It will probably be in the region of 2,000 at best.  That is what will derive from a capital budget of &euro;360 million.<\/p> <p> This is against a background in which we do not have figures on how many people have joined the council list this year.  It is extraordinary.  We have seen the worst housing emergency in the history of the State but we do not know how many people joined the housing list this year.

I am pointing out that it does not address it.  It repeats the mistakes of the past.  Having failed to do what was necessary to deal with the housing crisis, in other words, build council houses or control rents, we are left in the invidious position whereby the only proposal being put before the House is an amendment to give new tax breaks to landlords.  Tax breaks to landlords and developers were precisely what caused the economic collapse.  That is where we are.<\/p>  <p>  It is difficult for us to know what to do with this.  Faced with the emergency that surrounds us, anything that even marginally improves on the disaster surrounding us cannot be opposed.  In the medium to long term, however, this compounds the problem because it diverts money from the real solution into tax breaks for landlords.  It gives landlords and developers even greater control over the market.  We need to move in the opposite direction.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the biggest beneficiaries of this, I suspect, will be the vulture funds that have bought all the NAMA properties.  Perhaps the Minister would like to comment on that.  It is bad enough that the NAMA properties were not given lock, stock and barrel to the local authorities to provide social housing and instead were sold to the funds at knockdown prices.  They have made a killing at the expense of NAMA, which we paid for.  Now, they are going to make a killing again by renting those properties back to the State which has only recently sold the properties to them.  It is extraordinary.  We are going to give tax breaks to the people to whom we sold the properties at knockdown prices.  One could not make this stuff up.  The Mafia would be greatly impressed at the ingenuity of it.  The bottom line is they are going to be vastly enriched by this.<\/p>  <p>  It is difficult to know what to say.  If even one extra property were made available to people on the social housing lists, I would welcome it, such is the disaster.  It is nauseating in the extreme that to provide the extra social housing that is so desperately needed, these funds have to make a killing.

I am suggesting what the Minister should have done instead.  In so far as it is supposed to deal with the issue of rent, a serious regime of rent control should have been introduced.  For example, I will set out how it works in Scotland.  Representatives from the local authority go to a property, measure it up and examine how it ticks various boxes, including insulation, general quality and so on.  The local authority decides that a given amount is what the landlord is allowed to charge and the landlord is not allowed to charge any more.  It does not matter where the property is.  The issue of profit for the developer or landlord simply does not come into it.  That is the way it should be, particularly faced with the current situation.  Instead, it seems we have to enrich these people by coaxing or luring them into providing social housing.  We are effectively rewarding them for their rack-renting and discrimination against social housing tenants.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know what to say.  It is a pity we have come to this.  Given that this is going to pass, will the Minister give the House a guarantee that this will be a short-term measure, the need for which will be removed by major investment in social housing?

The reality is that there have been 1,270 social housing completions under this Government since 2011.

They will recall that the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, and I made a joint announcement on a series of measures to deal with the problem of rents, rental property and the lack of supply and housing market.  There was a range of measures and I am sure Deputies can recall some of them.  They included everything from NAMA's commitment to build 20,000 houses over the next five years to the commitment of the Minister, Deputy Kelly, to confine rent increases to limited periods.<\/p>  <p>  This is a proposal I brought forward in response to a case made by some Deputies in the House, but more particularly by the voluntary organisations.  They were very concerned about increasing homelessness, particularly in Dublin.  The case made to me was that as the economy grew and as more people got jobs, people in work could pay more rent than people in receipt of rent supplement or assistance from the local authorities, and some landlords were replacing people on rent supplement or those getting assistance from local authorities with tenants who were economically viable and could pay more rent.  This was the case made and presented to me by the voluntary organisations and many Deputies in the House as a key driver of homelessness, particularly in this city.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment is not a big issue and is designed in the first instance to incentivise landlords to hold onto their tenants who are in receipt of rent supplement or financial assistance from the local authorities, and to incentivise them to look at a more even playing pitch when choosing a new tenant because they will get this extra benefit in terms of a tax break on their interest if they select a tenant on rent supplement rather than a tenant from the labour market in the private sector.  This is its purpose.  Of course it is not designed to solve the housing problem.  It is not even designed to solve the rental problem.  It is designed to make an impact on an issue related to homelessness, which was explained in great detail by the voluntary organisations involved, and their arguments were taken up by a number of Deputies in the House.  This is the position and it is why we are introducing it.<\/p>  <p>  Existing tenancies registered prior to 1 January can qualify, once the landlord registers an undertaking to continue to make the accommodation available for three years on or after 1 January 2016 but no later than 31 March 2016.  This is the question Deputy McGrath asked and it was a very good question.  If this was not allowed, it would not work as intended.  There is also a sunset clause, which provides for a three year permanent tenancy, which must be given before the additional part of the interest rate, between 75% and 100%, is rebated to the landlord.  It is an incentive built in for this reason.  It allows the landlord to roll it over again and give security of tenure for a six year period, and to avail of a break on 100% of the interest rather than the 75% available at present.<\/p>  <p>  It does not apply to all landlords because some landlords do not have any mortgages.  This only works as a tax incentive if one has borrowed to the point where there can be a tax break on the interest.  Of course many landlords are very indebted.  There is a case to be made that it should be a deductible expense at 100% for all landlords.  This case was made by representative groups, including IBEC.  It would cost &euro;180 million and would be mostly dead weight because it would not incentivise any additional supply or progression towards extra tenancies at least for two years.  I decided not to go that way but to have a very narrow focus on this aspect.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty asked how it would be apportioned if a property was divided into a number of living units.  The legislation provides for the interest deduction to be apportioned on a just and reasonable basis between various properties or between parts of one property let under qualifying and non-qualifying tenancies.  The increased interest deduction will be allowed on interest relating to qualifying tenancies only.  If there are five units in a house and it costs &euro;1 million in total, that is &euro;200,000 apiece, and if two are rented to people on rent supplement only the interest which runs from those two apartments will be covered.  It will be apportioned justly and fairly.<\/p>  <p>  I do not think the Deputies want me to go through the range of measures already announced, but it is true to say the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, announced &euro;3.7 billion in the capital programme for social housing up to 2021.  We all know we went through times when the country was bankrupt, in effect.  Any money we had to spend we had to borrow from abroad, from our colleagues in Europe or the IMF.  We lived on the charity of our friends because the country went bust under the previous Administration.<\/p><p>It took a lot to repair it.  I would be the first to say that many of the decisions made were tough, hard to make and implement and unpopular.  Nevertheless, they had to be made.

The policies followed by the Greek Government ended up with the country on the brink of disaster.  The Greek Prime Minister of the day realised this and sacked his finance Minister, and a different set of policies have been followed since.  The Deputy should not shake his head when a country that applied a successful formula is now growing very rapidly.<\/p>  <p>  One of the reasons for the housing crisis is the fact that the country is growing very rapidly.  One of the reasons for the housing crisis is that so many young people have jobs in this city and they want to form families.  That is where the demand is coming from, by and large.  It is also coming from some emigrants coming home and migrants coming in.  That is the way it works.  It is very hard, as Deputy Rabbitte says, to flick a switch and get 10,000 houses overnight.  It is going to be difficult because the building and development industry, of all the sectors in the economy, was the most fractured.  It is still fractured, but we are working very hard to remediate it and get traction on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I would be first to admit that the amendment is narrow in its focus, and it is intended to be so.  It will be narrow in its results and it is intended to be so.  It is designed specifically to deal with an issue raised by the voluntary organisations.  Landlords found it more profitable to rent to tenants other than tenants on rent supplement, and this was leading to homelessness.  People had their leases discontinued and they could not get new leases from other landlords.  I hope it works, but it is one of those cases in which we will have to see what happens in practice.  It has been welcomed and there is sufficient traction for it to work as intended.  Of course, it will not solve the housing problem, as it is one contribution.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, and I have announced a series a measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400039#MM00600","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1448393400,"counter":575,"content":"<p>As the Minister knows, finance Bills generally contain the taxation measures set out in the budget, with a costing provided in the budget booklet for all the other taxation measures.

Some of them will already have tenants in receipt of State supports and they will be entitled to this particular tax break.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the overall package, the really important missing piece of the jigsaw for supply in the housing sector is the lack of a sustainable financing model for builders and developers.  The Minister announced some time ago a &euro;500 million joint venture fund under the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, with an interest rate in the region of 14%.  The Minister knows that the main banks in Ireland are risk-averse - understandably so, given what happened - and when they are prepared to finance development projects, they might give 60% to 65% of the overall cost.  Builders and developers are finding it exceptionally difficult to put a viable financing model in place and the State has failed so far to deliver that piece of the jigsaw.  More could be done in that area, which might help kick-start supply, which is the root cause of the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400039#MM00700","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1448393400,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I rise for the second time to ask the Minister to answer the questions I put.  Deputy McGrath has just repeated them.  What is the cost of this measure?  How many individuals does the Minister expect to avail of this measure?  There are obviously existing tenants and landlords who will be able to avail of this, so what will be the cost?  Has there been any examination of the knock-on effects on the rental property market?<\/p>  <p>  I very much regret bringing a tear to Deputy Durkan's eye earlier, but I was just rubbishing Deputy Rabbitte's point by putting on the record of the House - I was not saying it was good, bad or indifferent - the indisputable fact covering five Governments, including the current one, which only completed 1,270 houses in the past five years.  The Deputy focused on the boom period, but let us compare that with the time between 1992 and 1996, which saw 10,600 homes built.  I recognise that there are different economic circumstances to consider, but the Deputy should not peddle the spin that this is the biggest house-building programme in the history of the State.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for the clarification regarding subdivision.  My particular questions are how many individuals are expected to participate and whether there has been any analysis.  Will the Minister commit to doing a quick follow-up analysis?  As I noted, the half-baked attempt at dealing with rising rents certainty had a major detrimental effect for many renters by pushing up rents over a very short period.  Will the Minister commit to this?  He is giving a three-year commitment for landlords, with a possible three years afterwards.  It is difficult to swallow because there is no other solution.  I agree that we cannot go to Aldi and get 10,000 houses, but the Government has been in office for five years.  This Finance Bill gives &euro;180 million in tax breaks to the top 14% of earners but the Government will not put bricks and mortar on the ground to build houses.

It is a pity that in order to deal with a problem that the Government failed to address for four years, the only way to stop further evictions is to line the pockets of developers and landlords.  We are back to where we started because of the emergency.<\/p>  <p>  Will there be an investment programme in social housing from public capital expenditure accompanying this amendment in order to do away with the need for this approach to delivering social housing?  If not, this will be a recipe to repeat the mistakes of the past.  Perhaps the process could be time-bound, phased out and replaced with the provision of council housing that should have been built, as the process should not have been stopped for the past four years.

At present it is estimated that approximately 87,500 households are in receipt of social housing supports.  This is made up of the following: 62,900 are in receipt of rent supplement; 20,000 are in the rental accommodation scheme, RAS; and 4,600 are in receipt of the housing assistance payment.  It is estimated that approximately 70% of landlords have debt outstanding on their properties and may therefore be in a position to benefit from increased interest deductability.  However, some landlords with outstanding debt would also have losses to carry forward.  In these cases, there would be a reduced incentive to avail of the scheme.<\/p><p>At present, according to the PRTB figures, there are 170,000 registered landlords and 320,000 registered tenancies.  Revenue has estimated that a full restoration of the 100% interest deductability for all residential tenancies, both private and social housing, would have an Exchequer cost in the region of &euro;80 million per year.  I think I inadvertently said &euro;180 million earlier, so I would like to correct that.  As this scheme will be demand-led, it is difficult to estimate the potential cost.  However, it is tentatively estimated that should 10% of all landlords avail of this scheme, the potential cost would be approximately &euro;8 million per annum.  As the incentive operates on a three-year arrears basis, the first costs would be due to be borne by the Exchequer in 2019 for tenancies in the period 2016 to 2018.  The potential cost in 2019 in respect of a three-year look-back is, therefore, tentatively estimated to be in the region of &euro;24 million, but of course it will depend on what the take-up is.  I think it was Deputy Doherty who looked for a further assessment.  I am informed by my officials that an <i>ex ante<\/i>economic assessment of the measures using the tax expenditure guidelines is being finalised currently.  A comprehensive assessment of the proposal has already indicated that the benefit would outweigh the cost.  I can publish or provide Deputy Doherty with this when it is completed.<\/p><p>Deputy Boyd Barrett talked about multi-millionaires and those with massive investments benefitting from this.

The test is whether he is prepared to rent to somebody on rent allowance.  If so, he or she gets the interest tax break of 100% rather than 75%, but only on the unit that is rented, not on the block.  The scheme does not depend on the background or nature of the landlord.  It does not distinguish between wealthy landlords and poor landlords, but it does distinguish between tenants, and it is because of the tenant that the landlord might qualify.  It is an incentive to the landlord to rent to tenants such as I have described and to reduce in the first instance the potential for them to lose their lease and become homeless, but the intention is also to even the playing field somewhat, so that it would be as worthwhile for the landlord to rent to a tenant who is being assisted in the way I have described as to somebody who has not been assisted in the way I have described.<\/p>  <p>  The registration of a three-year commitment is with the PRTB.  The fact that landlords who are availing of the scheme have to register will allow us to do a running tot and see how many landlords are actually availing of the rent allowance.  After the three-year period we will have very good data, but since it is demand-led, it is very hard to be absolutely accurate on it.  I am not building it up as a solution to the rental problem; I am simply saying it is one measure among a range of measures announced by myself and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.  This particular one is on the tax side, so it is appropriate for the Finance Bill, but it is based on the potential arguments about homelessness, rather than fixing the rents or anything like that.<\/p><p> Deputy Michael McGrath raised another interesting point about the present funding model for the building sector.  As any of the Members who have been around for ten years or longer will be aware, the model was that a small builder built 60 or 70 three-bedroom houses, usually semi-detached, with the odd four-bedroom house studded into the scheme, and then he sold them and moved on to the next site to build another 60 or 70.  The funding model was that between 60% and two thirds of the cost was funded by the bank, but the equity piece was the profit on scheme A rolled into scheme B.  That is how it was done.  When the small builders went bust, they had no equity.  The banks are still prepared to give a good builder 60%, but where does he get the other 40%?  This is the point Deputy Michael McGrath has addressed, and he is absolutely right.<\/p> <p> We have tried a number of schemes.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund put a fund of &euro;500 million together.  The equity is expensive.  They were charging 15% on it, but there has been take-up.  I understand there will be a second tranche of funding, the interest rate on which will be slightly lower, but that may not make a dramatic difference.<\/p> <p> A model that some builders are using now to reduce the interest rate on the equity is to offer profit-sharing on the up side.  For example - I am not sure whether these figures apply in real life - funding is made available at 7% provided the lender gets 40%, 30% or 20% of the profit on the scheme.  There are different models being tried.<\/p> <p> The cheapest funding is in publicly quoted companies.  For instance, both Cairn Homes, which now has an interest in Dublin, and Hines from Texas, probably the biggest developer in the world, which has the Cherrywood land with sites for 4,500 houses, can get funding on the market at 3.5% or 4% because they are publicly quoted.  The movement is in that direction because if a developer can fund through the banks to the tune of 60% or 66% - two thirds - and if he or she can fund on the markets at 3.5% or 4%, that is a working model.<\/p> <p> What we trying to do in all directions is to repair a sector that was badly damaged.  The builders were damaged and the funding model was damaged, and morale was shot to bits.  Then, on top of that, as we came through the recession, the sectors that were most scapegoated, for good or bad reasons, were builders and developers and banks.  We need a combination of the two to fix housing supply.  If one talks to small builders, many of them will say they would get out if they could.  Some of the courageous ones are going back in.  No doubt it will take a while to rebuild it.<\/p> <p> Deputy Michael McGrath will probably come back at me when I say it, but we are quickly moving towards the economic and social problems of success rather than of failure.  No doubt housing will be an issue in the lifetime of the next Government, but traffic and transport are becoming increasingly pressing issues as well.  It is getting more difficult to come in from west Dublin off the M50, and that is directly related to an economy growing at 6%.  All sorts of decisions will have to be made.<\/p> <p> All I would ask is that the Deputies stop the sloganeering.  They do not have to do it.  There is a lot to be done and there is a lot can be done constructively.  If the debate is reduced to slogans, it is great fun but it gets nowhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400040#NN03400","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1448394600,"counter":612,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1448394600,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<\/p><blockquote>In page 39, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:&quot;<b>20.<\/b>The Minister shall, within nine months from the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on options available with regards to ensuring that the new Petroleum Products Tax applies to all earnings from all petroleum revenue within Irish territory, regardless of discovery date at the taxable field.&quot;.<\/blockquote><p>We had a short discussion on this on Committee Stage.  It is a different amendment but it goes to the same core issue.  It relates to the oil and gas that has been found but also the new taxation rates the Minister introduced in the Finance Bill.  I must say we welcome the change to the petroleum products tax, but it falls short of the overall change that is required.<\/p><p>This amendment, given the limitations on the Opposition in terms of tabling amendments that pose a charge on the State, is framed in such a way as to provide that the Minister shall, within nine months from the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on options available with regard to ensuring that the new petroleum products tax applies to all earnings from all petroleum revenue within Irish territory, regardless of the discovery date at the taxable field.<\/p><p>The tax, now that the Minister is introducing the increase, will only apply in the case of any discover of oil or gas after 18 June 2014, which will result in the exclusion of significant finds, such as the Corrib gas field, from this tax.  We would like to see this tax applied to all future earnings on any discovery, regardless of when the discovery was made.  It is not about changing the rules and trying to apply a tax for years that have passed, but about applying a tax on profits that will accrue from the production of fields that have been discovered in previous years.<\/p><p>I note that the report issued by the committee, which enjoyed all-party approval, went away beyond what the Minister is proposing in the Bill.  The Minister hired a consultancy firm to examine that, and suggests the model that the firm suggested.<\/p><p>The core of the proposal here is that it should apply to all profits, regardless of discovery date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400041#OO00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1448394600,"counter":614,"content":"<p>I support the amendment proposed by Deputy Pearse Doherty.<\/p>  <p>  The context of this is one of the major political scandals in the State over the past few decades, which was accurately called \"the great Irish oil and gas robbery\" by the Workers' Party even before the giveaway took the form it took in the 1990s.  It was carried out by the former Minister for Energy, Ray Burke, and the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and was accurately described by the former T&aacute;naiste, Dick Spring, as an act of economic treason.  I refer to the giveaway of significant oil and gas resources, estimated by the companies themselves as the equivalent of 20 billion barrels of oil, worth &euro;600 billion at today's prices.  It resulted in a system which has yielded among the lowest levels of tax in the world, according to a report commissioned by a previous Government from Indecon.  This proposal from the Government goes a tiny way towards remedying that but, in reality, would leave Ireland still at the very bottom of the pile in terms of the tax take from oil and gas and would continue to allow our oil and gas effectively to be given away, with no security of supply guaranteed and no control over what happens to it under these major oil multinationals, with the kind of behaviour that we saw over the past decade in the west by both Shell and Statoil at the expense of a local community.  I agree with the amendment, which provides for the preparation of a report from the Government about how even this minimal measure could be applied to all finds.  I do not accept the argument made by the Minister on Committee Stage that this would somehow amount to retrospective taxation, because it clearly would not.  We are talking about tax from now on as opposed to tax applied retrospectively.  It is simply a question of when the oil and gas was discovered.  I do not see how a case can be made about legitimate expectation, etc., that rules us out of going there.  It is clear, if the Government is serious in any way about tackling the giveaway that has taken place, that it should apply at least to all finds.  Presumably, the Minister will oppose the amendment.  I am interested in hearing his response as to why we cannot even have a study on this.<\/p>  <p>  To demonstrate how minimal the Government's response on these issues has been, it may be noted that in 2012 the Oireachtas committee all-party report recommended a take of 40% on smaller discoveries and 80% on larger discoveries.<\/p><p>Instead, we have 30% and 55%, which is clearly completely and utterly inadequate.

The one thing the all-party committee agreed on was that there should be no retrospective application.  I thank the Minister for keeping faith with the proposals I brought to the Government following the Wood Mackenzie report.  The debate took place in the House with a very diverse range of views, and some entirely unfeasible propositions were advanced, but everybody agreed there would be no retrospective application.<\/p>  <p>  The challenge is to put in place a tax regime that will bring a fair return to the Exchequer without frightening away the exploration capacity we need.  Ireland does not have the resources to go drilling offshore.  We do not have the kind of investment that can afford to spend &euro;100 million per offshore well.  Way back in the 1970s, there was a brief period of optimism when it looked as though we might imitate some of the great finds in Norway and the North Sea.  However, since the 1970s, we have made no oil find.  Despite all the talk about giving away &euro;600 billion, or whatever figure people want to pluck out of the sky, we have never had an oil find.  We have had three gas finds that gave rise to the optimism of the early 1970s, and the find off north Mayo is the fourth.  This has been the entire result of prospecting in offshore Ireland.  While the well off Belmullet is small, it has the capacity, at peak, to meet 60% of Ireland&rsquo;s needs.  The peak will probably be brief, probably less than a decade.<\/p>  <p>  The challenge is to increase prospecting and attract those who have the expertise, drilling capacity and, above all, resources to increase the level of exploration off our shores.  We have not even managed to drill two wells on average during the past decade.  At this rate, it is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.  The Department directly concerned has assimilated a great deal of scientific and geological data that was not available earlier and it shows positive promise, but only if we can increase the exploration rate.  The challenge was to strike a balance between a fair return to the Exchequer and not scaring away the exploration companies that we might attract here.  Out of the blue, oil prices fell from more than $100 per barrel to half that price.  There are more lucrative areas in the world for drilling than Ireland.  If there is one area in which the ultra left of Ireland believes in poppycock and fairy tales, it is offshore exploration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400042#PP00200","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1448395200,"counter":617,"content":"<p>We got all our ideas from the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400042#PP00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1448395200,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy Paul Murphy's announcement that he is paying his local taxes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400042#PP00400","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1448395200,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I am not paying my water charges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400042#PP00500","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1448395200,"counter":620,"content":"<p>It is very important in my constituency in view of the fact that, after the protests about the bin charges, they left the residents with huge bills and moved on to the next protest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400042#PP00600","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1448395200,"counter":621,"content":"<p>Is this relevant?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400042#PP00700","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1448395200,"counter":622,"content":"<p>We can talk all we like about &euro;600 billion in oil revenues.
