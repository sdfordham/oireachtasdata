It is a difficulty that has been experienced for quite some time which applies very much to nursing homes outside Dublin.  The moneys they are entitled to collect under the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, may be far lower than the cost of providing care to elderly people.  When the NTPF set out the amount to be paid, no appeals process was put in place for when there is a genuine reason for an increased amount to be paid.  The figures were set in stone by the NTPF and no other opportunity is available.  It is in this context I raise the matter to see whether a very simple appeals process could be put in place to deal with it.  Obviously, I do not want it opening up a situation whereby everyone can appeal.  Certain circumstances would have to be set out on the reasons for an appeal and why it is felt it is warranted that the figure fixed by the NTPF is unfair and unreasonable within which to provide a service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#B00300","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The legislation underpinning the nursing home support scheme requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the NTPF should it wish to be an approved nursing home for the proposed scheme.  The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its functions and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis.  The Department of Health has no role in such individual negotiations.<\/p><p>The NTPF examines the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process, with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and to the State.  In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home, evidence of value for money, prices previously charged, the local market price, budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.<\/p><p>When the nursing home support scheme commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  In advanced of the review, which was subject to an extensive and structured public consultation process, submissions were sought from groups or bodies which wished to make a contribution.  Nursing Homes Ireland made a submission in this regard in which it sought, <i>inter alia<\/i>, as the Senator has asked about, an appeals system for nursing home providers.  The report of the review, which I am sure the Senator has seen, was published in 2015 and a number of issues have been identified from more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanisms by the NTPF with a view to ensuring value for money and economy with the lowest possible administrative costs and burdens for clients and the State; increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanisms so that existing and potential investors can make as informed a decision as possible; and ensuring adequate residential capacity for those residents with a more complex need.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is also doing this with a view to increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanisms so that existing and potential investors can make as informed a decision as possible and to ensure that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.  This pricing review will also include consideration of the appeals mechanism.  It is not deemed feasible to address the situation in isolation and it must be considered as part of the totality of the pricing system review, which will be completed as soon as possible.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, has alluded to a timeframe of the end of the year and I will hold it to that.<\/p><p>In this context, we must be careful about placing too much reliance on an appeals mechanism.  The Senator has pointed out that this might not be open to everyone but, in establishing an appeals system, it could become a default option for operators, which could displace the main pricing mechanism.  It is important to develop a robust system that everyone understands and delivers fairer outcomes consistently.  If we can achieve this, an appeals system would be much less important.  If we can get the pricing mechanism right and address some of the issues the Senator and others have raised with me, there would be no need for an appeals mechanism.  If new mechanisms are put in place after the review is finalised at the end of the year and we are still seeing the same problems, we can address that issue afterwards.  If we allow the review to be finalised, we will see what comes of it.  If the Senator wishes to revert to me subsequently, we can deal with the matter then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#B00400","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

CETA will apply to an unprecedented number of public contracts, including at local level, which will have implications for the policy space in those contracts or services.  The European regulatory council will have a mandate to privilege the least burdensome option in respect of regulation, which has the potential to undermine present and future regulations over, for example, environment, employment and employment issues.  This concern has been highlighted by ICTU, environmental lobby groups, Tr&oacute;caire and many health organisations.  CETA was negotiated prior to Brexit and the removal of the UK's large market from the EU could see Canadian beef exports redirected into other countries like ours, which would have a serious economic impact.<\/p> <p>However, my focus is on the Constitution.  Will the Minister of State assure the House that, when he or another member of the Government attends the Council of Ministers meeting in October, the Government will not sign up to the provisional application of CETA and will instead uphold Article 29.5.2o of the Constitution, which reads: \"The State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann\"?<\/p> <p>Let us be clear in that CETA will involve a charge on public funds.  It would bring into effect for the first time in Ireland investor-state dispute settlement courts, which could allow corporations to sue the State for the potential loss, not only of present profits, but of future ones.  In other countries where such courts already operate, many of the settlements sought have run into billions in national currency.  The ultimate blank cheque, it could speedily deplete the Government's proposed rainy day fund.<\/p> <p>In response to parliamentary questions, the Minister has stated that such trade agreements are not part of domestic law, which is why separate adjudication arrangements are required.  However, any law that is applied within our State must be tested for compatibility with our laws and to ensure that they are not repugnant to the Constitution.  Has the Minister spoken with the Attorney General in this regard?  Is the Minister comfortable with a situation in which Irish companies would work under Irish domestic law while international companies would have recourse to a new and different mechanism, which would be a particular advantage for them?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The current position held by the EU Commission in this regard is somewhat contradictory.  In recognition of the political situation, it has agreed to treat CETA as a mixed agreement that requires the approval of the European Parliament and national parliaments.  At the same time, it wants signing and provisional application to go ahead in advance of the securing of political approval from the various parliaments.  It has reserved the legal opinion that the EU Commission has exclusive competence and has said it will wait to see the outcome of a case being taken in respect of the EU-Singapore deal at present.<\/p><p>In the circumstances I have outlined, would it not be prudent for other member states and the Irish Government to wait to see the results of that court case, which are due next year, before any provisional application is signed?  This has been recommended by many legal experts, including those from ClientEarth.  Given that a court case on the constitutionality of CETA was recently launched in Germany, and in light of the widespread and growing calls for a case on the overall compatibility of investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms with EU law to be taken to the European Court of Justice, is it not inappropriate to move ahead when so many cases are pending?<\/p><p>This is not a case of trade as usual.  The EU Commission has marked this as a milestone.  It has been suggested that as the most ambitious trade agreement ever, this marks the beginning of a new generation of such agreements.  If we are in a new and experimental space, in which we are trying out a new generation of trade agreements, does it not behove us to test them fully against our legal and parliamentary systems?  What signal does it send to the EU population, at a time of growing and dangerous disillusionment with the rule of law and politics, if states and EU bodies choose to bypass the legal and parliamentary processes to short-circuit matters in respect of this particular trade agreement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#C00700","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Higgins and welcome her contribution.  We should have had a debate on these agreements in recent years.<\/p> <p>The EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, is a new-generation agreement that will remove over 99% of tariffs between the EU and Canada.  CETA will significantly improve business opportunities for Irish companies in Canada.  With CETA, Irish companies will receive the best treatment that Canada has ever offered to any trading partner, thereby levelling the playing field on the Canadian market for Irish and other EU companies.  By opening markets, CETA should support growth and jobs and bring further benefits for consumers.  It has the potential to keep prices down and to provide consumers with greater choice.<\/p> <p>The main benefits of this agreement for Ireland include the opening up of public procurement markets in the Canadian provinces.  This will give Irish firms increased access to Canadian public sector purchasing.  Ireland will also gain unlimited tariff-free access for most of its important food exports.  Of course, we are all conscious of the importance of food exports from Ireland, particularly to Canada.  In addition, Ireland successfully campaigned for a low beef import quota from Canada to the EU, thereby safeguarding our important EU market in this area.  Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, thereby saving on double-testing on both sides of the Atlantic.  This is of particular benefit to smaller companies for which it can be prohibitive to pay twice for the same test.  These are some of the benefits of the trade deal with Canada, which will provide new market opportunities for Irish firms in many sectors.<\/p> <p>In May of this year, the Council had an exchange of views on CETA and on the process towards signature and provisional application of CETA.  The European Commission and the member states highlighted the high quality of the agreement that had been reached with Canada and expressed a desire to work towards the signature of the agreement at the EU-Canada summit in October.  The Commission published its proposals for signature, conclusion and provisional application on 5 July last and they are available on the Commission's register of documents.  On 13 May last, at the most recent meeting of the EU Council of trade ministers, the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, made clear that our approach - based on our current assessment of the provisions of CETA - is that we view CETA as a mixed agreement in terms of EU and member state competency.  In view of the position taken by Ireland and other member states, the Commission has now decided to submit CETA to the Council for decision as a mixed agreement.  This means each member state will be required to ratify the agreement under its own procedures.  The Oireachtas will be part of the final decision on ratification.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Pat Breen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1766\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1766&amp;amp;pid=PatBreen&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It will now be a matter for the Council and the European Parliament to decide on the signature, conclusion and the provisional application of the CETA.<\/p><p>Provisional application is provided for in the EU free trade agreements.  This means that those areas where the EU has full competence may be applied immediately once the agreement comes into force.  It is an important mechanism that allow companies and consumers to benefit from a trade agreement at an early stage.  Provisional application of the CETA would be without prejudice to national ratification by member states.  The provisional application of free trade agreements is standard practice.  What is at issue is what should be within the scope of such application.  Discussion on this matter continues in the Council.  We have argued that only those areas directly within exclusive Commission competence should be covered by the provisional application.  As already noted, the Commission has already accepted that the CETA is a mixed agreement.<\/p><p>It is in Ireland's interest to see strong progress towards the implementation of the CETA as it will provide opportunities for Irish firms to diversify their export markets further.  Total export and import trade between Ireland and Canada is worth &euro;2.5 billion, which is based on 2014 trade results.  That is a great deal of trade between the two countries and there are great opportunities to grow it further when the CETA is implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#D00200","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I ask the Senator to be brief.

As it turns out, my question is timely, given the news today about Russia and the International Olympic Committee.  I am not asking a question about that matter, nor is it about drugs or doping in sport.  In fact, it is of a more general nature and was prompted more by the ongoing disclosures about Console and charity regulations.  Also, I have met certain individuals who, based on their own experiences, are seriously concerned about the governance of a particular sport in Ireland, namely, tennis.  They have raised a number of issues with me.  However, in listening to them I felt the issues being raised might be of general concern in terms of sports body governance.  <\/p> <p>I acknowledge the many thousands of people across Ireland who work in a voluntary capacity and do immense work in sports organisations.  At a very low level, I am involved with the FAI in the local schoolgirl soccer league; therefore, I know the work and commitment that goes into volunteering.  I do not mean to question people's commitment or the huge goodwill shown by them.  There are, however, three issues that are relevant in referring to national sports organisations funded by the Irish Sports Council.  Will the Minister of State outline the mechanisms in place to ensure good governance in such organisations?  There is accountability for funding.  Clearly, different amounts are provided for different sports bodies by the council.  Is there a general mechanism in place to ensure accountability?  I understand some funding is channelled through another organisation.<\/p> <p>In terms of general governance and the rules sports bodies adopt in selecting, for example, competitors to take part in national or regional competitions, does the Irish Sports Council have any role or mechanism in place to ensure transparent and fair procedures are followed?  <\/p> <p>The most serious issue is that of child protection.  Does the Irish Sports Council have a role in ensuring child protection procedures are observed?  In the term of the last Government significant legislation dealing with vetting, child protection and the disclosure of abuse was passed.  In this regard, how are national procedures implemented?  How does the Irish Sport Council ensure national procedures are implemented at local level?  Everyone will be aware of the huge scandal in the sport of swimming.  We need to ensure the child protection mechanisms now in place are robust, watertight and being observed by the different sports bodies funded by the Irish Sports Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#F00400","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his kind words of welcome.

The implementation of good governance practices in sport has improved significantly in recent years.  Sport Ireland and its predecessor, the Irish Sports Council, have played a key role in this improvement.  Sport Ireland continues to work closely with the national governing bodies of sport to provide supports and services, with a focus on improving governance within sports bodies.  They include support for strategic planning, internal audit and financial management.  There is an established procedure in place for Sport Ireland to provide support for any particular governing body that encounters difficulties.  <\/p><p>Since my appointment as Minister of State, I have met a significant number of the national governing bodies of sport to get a handle on the stage they are at in the cycle of development, their priorities, the challenges they are facing and where they see themselves going.  All of the national governing bodies of sport are keen to see the conclusion of the development of the national sport policy.  One of my priorities as Minister of State with responsibility for sport in the coming months is the development of a national sports policy.  The policy is on my desk and I am reviewing the draft which will go out for public consultation and be discussed by the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p><p>In terms of governance, the national sports policy will aim to define consolidated governance principles to underpin the future of Irish sport.  I think that is what the Senator alluded to and I agree with her, particularly on what happened in swimming which was a wake-up call.  Certainly, the recent revelations in the charities sector are another wake-up call.  Sport Ireland has an important role in governance issues for the national governing bodies of sport and ensuring taxpayer's money is used in the most effective way and properly accounted for.  However, as the Senator alluded to - we all agree with her - governance and accountability are about more than just financial accountability.<\/p><p>It is important that national governing bodies of sport which are independent entities have some space in decision-making within their own organisations.  That covers the Senator's point about the selection of competitors.  There has been a great deal of interest recently in the selection of competitors for the Rio Olympic Games, but neither the Department nor Sport Ireland has a role in the selection of individuals.  Once the selection criteria are signed off on by the national governing bodies of sport at the outset, they are communicated to Sport Ireland and difficulties invariably arise.  In the case of every Olympic Games and international meet one will have issues.  I was asked recently if I would intervene in an issue to do with the Olympic Games and I had to tell the person in question that I could not do so because the next thing I would have to do was pick the Limerick under-21 team.  It is not the role of politicians or Sport Ireland to engage in the running of national governing bodies of sport.  However, I agree with the Senator that it is our role to ensure the national governing bodies of sport are accountable financially and in every other way.<\/p><p>The national governing bodies of sport are central to Irish sport and the achievement of sports policy objectives in terms of participation, performance and excellence.  It is important to recognise that not one size fits all.  National governing bodies of sport can range from small organisations run by a number of volunteers, to which the Senator alluded, to large-scale organisations run by full-time administrators.  However, whatever the size of the organisation, sports organisations in receipt of public funds should have appropriate governance structures in place.  That brings me back to the same point the Senator raised about Console.  We have major charity organisations that run a very good ship and by the same token we have small charities that do the same.  We have seen organisations at both ends of the spectrum that were in dire need of an intervention at a much earlier stage but which did not happen.<\/p><p>The new national sports policy framework will seek to set out governance  procedures for Irish sport, including the roles of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Sport Ireland, the national governing bodies of sport and all sports bodies in receipt of public money.  The policy will consider options to uphold the highest standards of governance in sport.  Sport Ireland is continually working to ensure good governance policies and procedures within organisations which are obliged to comply with requirements in that regard.  Let me give an example of what is required.  Any organisation which applyies for funding from Sport Ireland must submit satisfactory projected budgets and operational plans.  All national governing bodies of sport are required to provide a mid-year update for Sport Ireland in order to receive their full grant.  Sport Ireland is subject to the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General and can also be examined by the Committee of Public Accounts.  In addition, any national governing body of sport in receipt of funding from Sport Ireland may be subject to an audit by Sport Ireland's auditors.  <\/p><p>Sport Ireland will continue to support those organisations that are delivering best returns for public investment.  It provides a range of supports and services for national governing bodies of sport in ensuring good governance, including board training provision, assistance in marketing and branding, volunteer support and assistance in organisational capacity building.  I have seen this at first hand with particular national governing bodies of sport where there are capacity issues.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Patrick O'Donovan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2316\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2316&amp;amp;pid=PatrickODonovan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I encourage Senators and all Deputies to go and see the National Sports Campus, if they have the opportunity.  Some of them may already have seen it.  It is second to none.  Sport Ireland is more than just a sports campus.  It regularly provides a set of soft skills to NGBs, and this capacity building is important to ensure what the Senator referred to, namely, good governance.<\/p><p>I agree with the Senator on the need to have safeguards and mechanisms in place to ensure good governance policies and procedures.  I am satisfied that Sport Ireland is working hard to make sure the improvements in this area continue.  I fully expect that, when completed, the national sports policy will lead to further enhancements around good governance.  If there is a specific issue regarding governance, whoever the Senator is referring to can contact my Department.  If there is an issue or a concern, whether founded or unfounded, regarding an NGB that is in receipt of taxpayers' money, we have a duty to examine it, if we have learned anything from all the stuff that has gone on during recent years.  If the Senator wants to bring a particular issue to my attention, I will have the Department and Sport Ireland examine it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#F00500","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>That was a comprehensive response.

I welcome the Minister and wish him well in his brief.  I raise the issue of the proposed closure of trout production operations in Ireland.  There are two such facilities, one in Roscrea and one in Mullingar.  There is no other licensed supplier of fresh brown trout, capable of supplying all the angling fish clubs throughout Ireland.  Recent figures produced by the Economic and Social Research Institute estimated that trout angling is worth approximately &euro;800 million to the Irish economy and that the recreational angling sector is responsible for anything up to 10,000 jobs.  In my area, Cavan-Monaghan, it is a major aspect of tourism.  Many bed and breakfasts are built on it and there is a vitally important cross-Border aspect.<\/p> <p>Given the figures and the return to the economy, it is difficult to understand why such a decision would be made.  If the decision goes ahead, jobs will be lost and the &euro;800 million we get from the facility will be lost.  I have never known an issue to raise the temperature among the angling community as much as this.  It is as bitter and potentially divisive as the rod licence issue a number of years ago.  There are more than 100,000 anglers, located in every county of Ireland, and they all speak with one voice on the issue.<\/p> <p>A consultation process is under way and the closing date for submissions is 9 August.  Given that it is alleged that the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland has already made the decision to close the facility, one could legitimately ask why we are having a consultation process.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Perhaps the Minister might comment on that issue.<\/p><p>I plead with the Minister to ensure this decision does not proceed.

If the Minister were to give a commitment to meet a deputation of anglers, an outcome could be found that would satisfy all parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#H00600","speaker":"1396","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I am speaking on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, who, unfortunately, is unable to attend.  I assure the Senator, however, that I will bring the issue he has raised to the attention of the Minister of State.  I will also ask the Minister of State to contact him directly to arrange a meeting with him at the earliest possible opportunity.<\/p> <p>Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, is the agency responsible for the protection, management and conservation of the inland fisheries and sea angling resources.  It was formed on 1 July 2010 following the amalgamation of the Central Fisheries Board and seven regional fisheries boards into a single agency.  The State has more than 74,000 km of rivers and streams and 128,000 ha of lakes, all of which fall under the jurisdiction of Inland Fisheries Ireland which is also responsible for sea angling out to a 12 mile limit. <\/p> <p>Inland Fisheries Ireland has a long history of providing rainbow and brown trout to support the fish stocking requirements of angling stakeholders.  Its main fish production unit is located at its fish farm near Roscrea, with a supporting facility which mainly supports the maintenance of brood stock located at Cullion in Mullingar.  It also has a small operation at Lough Allua.  The proposal for the rationalisation of its fish farm operations is a day-to-day operational matter for the board of IFI.  However, IFI advises that, from a structural perspective, the fish farming operation is based on physical structures and facilities designed and built in the 1950s.  Since that time, meeting the increasing demands of operational and regulatory requirements from facilities that are dated has become more complex and challenging. <\/p> <p>I am advised by the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland that it is IFI's intention to exit fish farming operations in the coming years at current locations, while maintaining one aquaculture facility at Cong, County Mayo which will be used for research and conservation stocking.  This site has been identified as having the most potential owing to the quantity and quality of its water supply, which is an important consideration in fish production.  Ultimately, the IFI hatchery at Cong is expected to be upgraded to a facility capable of housing modern hatchery and research operations.  <\/p> <p>Inland Fisheries Ireland also announced that it was always intended that the phase-out plan would include consultation with the affected stakeholders, to whom the Senator referred.  The former Minister of State wrote to the chairperson of Inland Fisheries Ireland noting that it was IFI's intention to consult those affected prior to any action being taken and that a report on the consultation would be made to the Department.  The Minister or State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, recently met the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland to reinforce the requirement that a full report be made to the Department.  IFI has written to the affected stakeholders advising that the farms are operating as normal in 2016 and that a consultation process will take place to develop the cessation plan. <\/p> <p>It is important to clarify that the decisions of the board were not prescriptive as regards a timeline or particular option as to how IFI would exit commercial production.   Inland Fisheries Ireland has reported to the Department that existing facilities are dated and in need of significant capital investment.  In addition, the regulatory climate in which IFI operates has become increasingly complex in terms of fish husbandry, with all of its associated disease, aquaculture and discharge requirements but also in terms of other environmental legislation under which Inland Fisheries Ireland operates such as the water framework and habitats directives.  <\/p> <p>Inland Fisheries Ireland has emphasised that the board decided to strategically exit from the production of rainbow and brown trout on a number of grounds.  IFI fish farms have operated at a significant loss in the past five years and while the agency has made significant efforts to reduce costs and increase efficiency in aquaculture operations, it has not been able to bridge the gap between costs and revenue.  The IFI board has been required, therefore, to focus its resources on core functions across all divisional areas.  <\/p> <p>Inland Fisheries Ireland commissioned an expert review of its production capabilities, operational processes, facility design and technologies, as well as operational costs, in an effort to identify challenges and constraints in production processes and to propose practicable solutions to enhance productivity and performance.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Patrick O'Donovan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2316\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2316&amp;amp;pid=PatrickODonovan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This review identified some major challenges, including those relating to environmental risks, the physical fish farm infrastructure and the current system for farm management.  The fish farm near Roscrea has an issue regarding the level of water supply available.  The current fish farm operations are subsidised by wider IFI resources because the price of fish for sale does not reflect the real cost of production.  On balance, and having given due consideration to these factors, the board decided to exit freshwater aquaculture operations and has instructed the executive of IFI to develop a plan to facilitate exiting this business while making efforts to ensure continuity of supply and trout for stocking for anglers.<\/p><p>All permanent IFI aquaculture staff at facilities at Roscrea, Cullion and Lough Allua will retain their employment within IFI and every effort will be made to ensure smooth redeployment to other areas of the organisation.  The board has already confirmed that no jobs will be lost and that all staff have roles within the organisation.  IFI has confirmed that it wishes to inconvenience stakeholders as little as possible and that it firmly believes it will be possible to implement the decision with minimal or no disruption to stakeholders.<\/p><p>Given these considerations, IFI has announced the commencement of a public consultation process with stakeholders and individuals affected by the decision to exit freshwater trout production, with a particular focus on the potential impact of the decision and possible measures that could mitigate this impact.  As the Senator said, the submission period is open until 5 p.m. on 19 August, and submissions may be made online.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#J00200","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

She then took the State to the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, and won.  We owe her a huge debt.  The ECHR said that the State should have been aware of the risk of child abuse in schools and that it was obliged to protect the children.  A total of 210 other people did not get as far as the ECHR.

I believe the issue is not that the EU needs to prepare but that we need to prepare.  There is no plan to achieve Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  The reason is not now an issue of culture or religion; it is economic.  The economic argument that we can put forward as to why Northern Ireland should rejoin the Republic is borne out in the UN development index which measures health, education and income.  The Republic ranks sixth in the world on the index, equal to Germany, and just above Canada and the United States.

A recent report by the Oireachtas employment committee stated that an all-island economy would be boost to everybody, in particular in the areas of education and farming, as well as on other issues.  I ask the Leader to organise this House, whether through the petitions committee or through the Cathaoirleach, so we could start bringing in the experts to discuss this issue.  It is not that the EU would prepare but that we would prepare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#O00300","speaker":"1414","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the Taoiseach's remarks over the past couple of days in terms of a referendum on Irish unity.

The speed of learning and the depth of interest from the children of those ages was remarkable.  However, as with many similar projects throughout the country, the funding was slashed and we could no longer continue.<\/p> <p>The idea behind the project was that we would encourage a cohort of young people to go on to follow computer science and develop their coding and programming skills.  This measure, in a remote rural area of the western seaboard, was an attempt to provide young people with the skills that would enable them to live and work in their own communities while, at the same time, working for companies based in Tokyo, New York and other major economic hubs throughout the world.

I wish to draw attention to one particular matter relating to disability.  Social Justice Ireland has a practical proposal in its document in respect of the cost of the disability allowance.  It is a well-known fact that people with disabilities have extra but ordinary day-to-day living costs.  The proposal is for a &euro;20 per week allowance to begin the redress and compensation in this regard.  There is no doubt that there are three things we can always say about people with disabilities.  First, their incomes will drop and - if it is not already the case - they and their families will go into poverty.  Second, there is a loss of expectation for employment, activity and housing.  There is also a loss of hope that is brought about by these circumstances.  This is a practical measure and I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Social Protection to the House to discuss the matter.  This could put some valuable money into the hands of every person with a disability in every corner and parish of the country.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government refers to a request for an Oireachtas all-party committee to develop a single long-term vision or plan for health care in the coming ten years.  We have the D&aacute;il committee setting.  When he was here, the Minister for Health expressed his interest in having participation from Members of this House.  He noted the varying expertise and understanding of people from across the House.

We have heard these in the D&aacute;il as well.  In every debate, people refer to new politics.  As yet, however, no one has been able to provide a definition of new politics or explain the theory of the language that underlies it.  I am reminded of the use of terms such as \"going forward\" in the past.  Everything was going forward but nothing was ever delivered.

There is an onus on the Taoiseach to come into the House and explain exactly what he means by \"new politics\" or whether it is simply a gesture, with no theory or clear understanding as to exactly what he means by the term.  I worry it is language without a plan.  We heard the same thing in respect of the summer school, when he spoke about a referendum on unification, where it was words with no plan.  Everybody is in favour of unification but a plan must be put in place.  Everybody is in favour of new politics but one must understand what it is, what the theory is and how pragmatically new politics can be delivered to this House.

While it seems fine that people are being refunded, there are two elements in this regard.  While there are those who booked their all-in package of flight and hotel accommodation, those who booked their own hotel accommodation are not entitled to anything.  The legislation was enacted back in 1983 but contains nothing to cover those who booked their accommodation directly through any of those companies.  I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Minister because it must be reviewed.  More than 15,000 people in Ireland have been affected by the Lowcostholidays fiasco but more than half of them will not be entitled to anything because they booked their accommodation directly through online companies.<\/p> <p>The second matter pertains to the threat of ash dieback disease, which affects the making of hurleys.  Everyone in Ireland is familiar with hurling, as all counties are involved in it, and it is great to see so many children and young people out playing it.  It has been recorded that this disease has been discovered in trees in 19 counties in Ireland.  It can be spread by someone walking through the forest or can be transmitted through the air.

It was announced yesterday that coding was to be introduced into schools, which I certainly welcome as being positive news.  However, I am concerned the news will raise expectations that may take some time to fulfil.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment will need time to develop a curriculum and will devise a means of integrating it with the existing subject areas.  There was some talk about mathematics being the subject to carry this new coding subject but I have my concerns about that.  As a child who struggles with mathematics might automatically turn away from coding, this issue must be considered.  One hears a lot about curriculum overload and no doubt it will be raised by teachers.  Teachers themselves will also require training and there is a major issue in respect of IT infrastructure in schools because without the fundraising of local parents, we would be in dire straits in that regard.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Despite the best intentions and ambitions of the schools and the pupils, teachers cannot achieve their aims because of lack of broadband connectivity and the desperate state of hardware in their schools.

The USB keys were accompanied by a letter saying that the Department of Education and Skills was sending them out by post because teachers could not download them via the internet.  This clearly demonstrates some of the issues we face with new digital skills.  We certainly do not want to be left behind in terms of computer science literacy.  They are key issues and key skills for the future.  We must focus on rolling out coding across the educational system without delay.  There is much work to be done and some realism needs to be brought to it as well.  There are many issues that need to be addressed if this is going to be a success.

It is hoped that this report will be studied, listened to and acted on in all the deliberations as the Government prepare for budget 2017.  Ireland faces major challenges.  There are challenges that have been constant, such as poverty, inequality and homelessness, but others will emerge and are emerging now as a result of the Brexit vote.  Social Justice Ireland is committed to a just society and recognises the need to invest in public services.  The current investment is far below what is required for infrastructure and services if it is to be close to the EU average.  For example, in the years of the downturn, the devastation wreaked across Europe led to cuts of 15% but across Ireland, the absolute devastation wreaked led to cuts of 39%.  I have spoken to Social Justice Ireland and focus particularly on health care and disability services.  My own area of Dublin South Central is above the national average in terms of the number of people with disabilities.  Cutbacks from 2008 to 2014 are most aversely affecting people on low incomes.  There are long waiting lists, increasing prescription charges, a change to the threshold on the drug repayment scheme and so on.<\/p> <p>I have listened to and I support the proposals outlined in Social Justice Ireland's document.  I would like to see the provision of additional support for older people to live at home and additional support services to meet the demographic pressures that are coming and will be more to the fore in the years to come.  An additional &euro;30 million has been suggested for disability services and &euro;42 million has been suggested to improve mental health services and progress the implementation of A Vision for Change.

There is deep concern in the North, particularly among the 56% of people who voted to remain, that we will be marooned with a Government that is austerity-driven in its ideology and which has punished ordinary citizens in the North over the past couple of years.  We could invite the authors of the report modelling Irish unification to address this House and its Members.  This is a comprehensive study carried out by very highly-regarded economists from North America and from Europe, who have identified that in the first eight years of reunification there could be a &euro;35.6 billion boost to all-island GDP.  That is just in the first eight years.  As someone who is in danger of being marooned with that London economy, that is very hopeful to me.<\/p> <p>Mar fhocal scoir, it is vital that we get the Taoiseach in.

We have heard contributions around the need for a forum.  Call it what one may, that is a very legitimate, important and practical call to make.  The Taoiseach seems to be up for it.

Previously, I have mentioned Ireland participating in, associating with or rejoining the Commonwealth.  All of these should be in the ether because they all bring a future for the island of Ireland.  I would like to see the people of Ireland and all traditions and all sides unite.<br\/><br\/>We saw what happened at the European championships, with Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland supporters along with many others behaving and bringing great joy.  Yesterday in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, a leading garda called for soccer banning orders.  He is very worried about the level of violence at League of Ireland soccer matches.  I raised this issue nine or ten years ago, when I saw Setanta Cup matches being played.  I felt there could be a deterrent.  There has been some violence but, thankfully, 99.5% of the games have been great.  I have always felt this issue needs to be tackled.  It is becoming more weaponised.  There is now category A violence, and a soccer match with a crowd of fewer than 5,000 people has the same amount of security and garda&iacute; as would be at an all-Ireland football final.  Something is wrong and this needs to be dealt with.  Last night, I watched a local derby between Shamrock Rovers and Bohemians.  I do not believe there were 4,000 or 5,000 people at the match but one could see the number of garda&iacute;.  It is not just in Dublin but around the country.  We need to bring in the Minister and ask for football offences legislation and perhaps stadium banning orders.  We need to give the garda&iacute; and football clubs all the protection we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#T00700","speaker":"1424","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the ongoing crisis at University Hospital Limerick.  This morning, 32 patients are languishing on trolleys.  Over a five-day period last week, we had 149 patients languishing on trolleys.  When one walks into the accident and emergency department, one will more than likely meet a sign stating there will be an eight-hour wait before seeing a doctor.  Last week, one man in the accident and emergency department was asked to stand where his wife's trolley was while his wife was wheeled away for tests to keep the corridor clear for the trolley on its return.  This is how ludicrous and awful the situation is.<\/p> <p>On the Friday night of the week before last, I drove my neighbour to the hospital.  She got into a ward the following Wednesday night.  It took five days of languishing in a corridor before someone who was extremely sick managed to get access to a ward.  Members of SIPTU and the INMO have had enough and, quite rightly, they are now balloting their members for industrial action, not because they want more money but because they are absolutely disgusted by the lack of action.  The most ludicrous point of all this is when the unions speak to management, the local hospital management agree with them that they need more staff but there is a moratorium.  We have a ludicrous situation where everyone agrees the place is in crisis but nothing is being done.<\/p> <p>We know the roots of this crisis lie with Fianna F&aacute;il, which closed accident and emergency departments in Nenagh and Ennis without making adequate provision for enough resources in Dooradoyle in Limerick.  We had five years of a Fine Gael and Labour Party Government, at the end of which things were worse than they ever were before.  It is a litany of failure on behalf of all of the major political parties.  It needs action and I ask the Minister for Health to come to the House as a matter of urgency to debate this.  I know from my neighbours and friends that people in Limerick have had enough.  People are frightened to have their relatives go into hospital.  Imagine that.  Imagine being in fear of seeing one's loved ones going into hospital.  This is the reality in Limerick.  It is at absolute crisis level and I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to come to the House urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#U00200","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I am sure some Senators have heard of the new video game Pok&eacute;mon GO.  It is relatively new to me.  It is sweeping the mobile gaming market in the US and apparently it has overtaken Twitter in the popularity stakes in some cases.  What it is different about this app is that contrary to most video games, which encourage a sedentary lifestyle, this inspires teens to get out of the house and walk.  The augmented reality game mixes the real world with the colourful world of Pok&eacute;mon, bringing the creatures into towns and streets.  Apparently this is having a ripple effect on health in the US.  It may be the novelty factor but Pok&eacute;mon GO seems to motivate young people, even those who have not been active for some time.  There are cases in the US of previously inactive people getting out and walking for miles to try to increase their Pok&eacute;mon stash.  Of course, there is a concern about young people not paying enough attention to safety but I believe safety measures could be implemented.  At present, Pok&eacute;mon GO is only available in the US, Australia, New Zealand and Germany.<\/p><p>As I have stressed in the House on numerous occasions, <i>ad nauseam<\/i>, Ireland is on course to become one of the fattest nations in the world by 2030 and we should do everything we can to remedy this.  As such, in the upcoming budget, the Government, of which my party is a member, should support video gaming companies to a greater degree when they come up with innovative ways to get people moving.  This may sound funny, and I do not know an awful lot about video gaming myself as it was a friend of mine who brought this to my attention.  Ireland is already very fertile ground for gaming and we make a lot of money from it.  We speak about new politics.  We should have innovative ways to deal with the problems we have.  I hope the Government is quite forward thinking when it comes to something like this in the upcoming budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#U00300","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Perhaps the Senator could recommend that Pok&eacute;mon GO reaches out to older people like myself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#U00400","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":78,"content":"<p>You are all very welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#U00450","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I welcome the news we will have coding classes in primary schools.

This is not fair in certain constituencies and is leading to a democratic deficit.  The geographical size of Mayo, which is my constituency, is greater than all of Dublin's constituencies put together, yet we only have four Deputies.  In Dublin North-Central, the quota is approximately 6,000, but it is 10,000 in Mayo.  This is repeated throughout the country.  It is unfair and shows an ignorance of the time and requirements involved in representing people who live in dispersed rural communities.  These factors are recognised in other jurisdictions.  Under the system in the US Congress, for example, smaller states have the same number of representatives as larger states, regardless of population.<\/p><p>There must be some equality or balance.  Populations in rural areas are declining.  The eight seats removed during the previous D&aacute;il were from the western seaboard.  The number of councillors has also decreased, yet the same areas must be covered and they are seeing the least amount of economic growth.  There is a democratic deficit.  We have poorer infrastructure and so on.  The new commission is a way to address all of that.  There is an issue with the Constitution, but giving proper democratic representation to every citizen as opposed to just those living in large urban centres is fundamental.

It is important that the House has a timely debate on the role of Senators in the country's future post-Brexit and on Irish reunification and the matters raised by the Taoiseach.  His remarks were interesting, in that they re-articulated his belief in the need for an all-Ireland forum on how to progress North-South relations.

He is also attending a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Cardiff this week.  In addition, as leader of the Government, he is making the changes within the Department of the Taoiseach that he outlined last night.  The Government intends to establish a new Cabinet sub-committee on Brexit which will be chaired by the Taoiseach.  An integrated approach will be taken within the Department of the Taoiseach under the Secretary General of that Department.  The Government will strengthen staffing in other key Departments to deal with the issue of Brexit.  It is important for Members of this House to play a role in the future of the country on an all-Ireland basis.  As many Senators have articulated, this issue needs to be addressed because it is very important for the economy, industries such as tourism and agriculture and the movement of people.<\/p><p>Senators Mark Daly and Diarmuid Wilson spoke about Louise O'Keeffe, whom we all admire and to whom we all owe a debt of gratitude.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges discusses and makes decisions on who to invite to the Seanad.  I have no difficulty with anybody coming into the Chamber, but it is not my decision to make.  It is important for Senator Mark Daly to recognise that the last Government created the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which meant that for the first time, there was a Cabinet Minister with responsibility for children.  It also enacted the Children First national guidance to protect the welfare of children, held a referendum on children's rights and established Tusla as a dedicated national child and family agency.  It introduced a plethora of legislation, including the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015, the Children First Act 2015, the Children (Amendment) Act 2015 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  None of us wants to go down the road of what happened in the past.  We all take the protection and security of children seriously.  That is what the previous Government did and the Government will do likewise.  It is important that we continue our work; we cannot become complacent.  We need to resource child protection agencies and see a greater partnership between the HSE and Tusla at all levels.  All Departments need to work together in a seamless way to protect children.<\/p><p>Senator John Dolan raised the cost of paying disability allowance, which is a very important issue.  He has made a good case in comparing the costs incurred by people with a disability who receive the allowance with those incurred by able-bodied people.  It is clear that higher costs are incurred by people with a disability.  The Senator, in his role with the Disability Federation of Ireland, has been a strong campaigner and advocate for changes to be made in the disability allowance regime to assist those who have to incur higher costs.  It is an ongoing issue.  I agree with the Senator that the Departments of Health and Social Protection need to adopt a more joined-up approach.  I will certainly be happy to facilitate a debate on the matter in the House.<\/p><p>Senators Colm Burke, John Dolan and James Reilly spoke about the meeting of the committee on future health strategy which is under way.  It is disappointing that the composition of the committee is not in keeping with the programme for Government, but it is not an Oireachtas committee.  Senator Colm Burke and I met the Chairman and the clerk of the committee last week and the outcome of the meeting was disappointing from our perspective.  There is a reluctance to appoint Members of this House to the committee.  As Leader of the Seanad and a former Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I do not see any reason Senators should be precluded from membership of this forum.  I do not know why the terms of reference governing the composition of the committee cannot be changed, even at this stage.  I will not say at this \"late\" stage because the committee is still agreeing to its overall work scheme.  The exclusion from a full participatory role in the committee of 60 Members of the Oireachtas is wrong.  It has been outlined to us that our views will be sought in the form of a submission, but we will not be asked to participate.  This is not new politics - it is bad politics.  It is exclusionary rather than inclusive politics.  I received a response when I wrote to the clerk on behalf of all of us which I can forward to Members after the Order of Business.<\/p><p>Senators Kevin Humphreys and Diarmuid Wilson referred to the request made by Senator Kevin Humphreys to bring the Taoiseach to the House.  I assure the Senator that the Taoiseach is willing to come to the House not because he wants the Taoiseach to come but because the Taoiseach wants to do so.  The Taoiseach is more than happy to attend and speak in the Upper House.  It is my intention that the date in question will be 29 September.  There will be a debate on a range of issues, including the post-Brexit environment, Ireland's place in Europe, Ireland's relationship with the United Kingdom following Brexit, the programme for Government and the impending budget to be announced in October.  There is no need to divide the House on the issue because the Taoiseach has agreed to come.  I share Senator Diarmuid Wilson's view that it is important for the leader of the Government to come to the House at least once in each term.  Other Taoisigh have been missing in action in the Seanad.  I am happy that we will have the Taoiseach in the House on 29 September.  I hope that will satisfy the Senators who have made proposals in that respect.<\/p><p>Senators Rose Conway-Walsh and James Reilly raised the issue of coding.  The Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, has written to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to ask it to consider the introduction of the teaching of coding in primary schools.  As a schoolteacher, this would be a brilliant act, especially in the light of the way the country has moved in terms of career development.  It would be extraordinary to see it happen.  Senator Rose Conway-Walsh referred to the success of Coder Dojo, which is an example of the benefits of teaching coding to young people.  It changes their perspective and also gives them a balanced approach to education.  I hope we can have a debate on the matter.  We will support this movement in any way we can.<\/p><p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about a company, LowCostHolidays, that has gone out of business.  We will take up this very important and serious issue with the Minister in question.  The bonding system that applies to travel companies needs to be changed.  We need to address the issue of bed banks, especially in terms of how they can get and charge for them.<\/p><p>Senator Robbie Gallagher raised the issues of coding and broadband connectivity.<\/p><p>Senators M&aacute;ire Devine and John Dolan highlighted the publication yesterday by Social Justice Ireland of a very interesting read.  I hope the Ministers for Social Protection and Finance will consider the document as part of the Government's approach to the budget to be announced in October.  The Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, was here last week, but we might invite him back in advance of the announcement of the budget.<\/p><p>Senator Ray Butler spoke about the dental scheme.  I hope the Ministers, Deputies Simon Harris, Leo Varadkar and Michael Noonan, can form a plan on dental care for young people.  The removal of the PRSI scheme for young people, in particular, was one of the big mistakes made in the last two D&aacute;ileanna and Seanaid.  The effects can be seen in the cost of dental work, the waiting times for orthodontic treatment and the bad state of repair of the nation's dental health.<\/p><p>Senator Ivana Bacik called for a debate with the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on the issue of Syrian refugees.  As the Senator knows, the Minister is committed to taking in more refugees.  She has established a task force on refugee protection.  I would be happy to have her come to the House.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Ivana Bacik that any regime or Government that contemplates using the death penalty should not be supported.  I certainly hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will take up the issue on our behalf.  Proposing to use the death penalty sends the wrong message and is the wrong thing to do.<\/p><p>I will be happy to accept Senator Colm Burke's amendment to the Order of Business on the missing persons Bill.<\/p><p>Senator Aidan Davitt also raised the issue of refugees.  I agree with him that there is a need to have an integration policy.  I do not think the Minister, Deputy Francis Fitzgerald, said or meant what the Senator might have thought she had said.  Her policy on refugees has been one of positivity.  She has been strong on the issue of national security and protecting the Border.  I will be happy to pass on the Senator's remarks and invite the Minister to come to the House after the summer recess.<\/p><p>Senator Frank Feighan spoke about soccer hooliganism, which is a worry.  I hope we will see the FAI working with all sports organisations to eliminate all forms of discriminatory behaviour in sports grounds.<\/p><p>I will note Senator Paul Gavan's remarks about University Hospital Limerick and ask the Minister responsible to liaise with him on the matter.<\/p><p>Senator Catherine Noone raised the issue of Pok&eacute;mon GO.  I certainly hope none of us will walk into the table or walls here.  We note that Pok&eacute;mon GO is an app.  The Senator is right when she says we must promote the gaming industry, which is a fertile ground for us.  We did this successfully when the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, was responsible for job creation.  Blizzard Entertainment in my city of Cork is promoting gaming and employing people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#V00800","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Are there any in the Chamber?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#X00100","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I hope not but if there are, they are not moving towards me.<\/p> <p>Senator Mulherin raised the constituencies boundary commission.

I would like to emphasise the importance of this Bill in the context of the commitment of the Government and all Members to give children the best possible start in life and to furthering equality and recognising the different types of families that exist in Ireland.<\/p> <p>Two issues arose.  Senator Maria Byrne asked if it proposed to include in the Bill a provision to allow a father to take time off to accompany the partner or surrogate mother to antenatal appointments, as is the case in the UK.  This Bill will not provide for time off to accompany an expectant mother to antenatal appointments.  The objective of the Bill was always to meet the Government&rsquo;s commitment in the last budget to two weeks paternity leave and benefit.  Changes to existing family leave legislation would be well outside the scope of the Bill and would have required Government decisions for which there was simply no time, if the deadline of September was to be met.  The proposed family leave Bill, which the Government has approved and is currently being drafted, will address all existing family leave legislation, such as parental leave, carer's leave, maternity leave and adoptive leave, and consolidate the legislation into one Act.<\/p> <p>The Senator also asked if the individual taking paternity leave could be someone other than the biological father.  I am very happy to be able to confirm that this is the case.  The Bill creates an entitlement to paternity leave for a relevant parent who, in addition to being the father of the child, is also defined as the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant, as the case may be, of the mother of the child and, in the case of a child who is being adopted, the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant, as the case may be, of the adopting mother or sole male adopter, or a parent of the child under section 5 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 where the child is a donor-conceived child within the meaning of Part 2 of that Act.  I hope my answer will satisfy the Senator.<\/p> <p>I thank all of the Senators for their contributions the last day, their co-operation and their constructive comments.  I also thank the officials from both Departments who have worked very hard to bring this Bill to where it is today.

This legislation empowers the fathers of young children and ensures that both parents play an equal role in the upbringing of children.  Senator Lombard has notified us that he will become the father of twins in a few weeks' time.  I am not sure how paternity leave works for Members of the Oireachtas but I am sure he will take some leave.<\/p> <p>I thank Senators Wilson, &Oacute; Donnghaile and Clifford-Lee for their co-operation on this Bill.  When something is the right thing to do, it is great when this House comes together and supports it because, ultimately, everyone is in politics to do the right thing.  We do not always agree on what is the right thing to do in this House.

I hope that we will see the terms and conditions of this Bill used by fathers.  I also hope that men will be supported by companies and that bosses will encourage them not to be afraid to look for this leave because the traditional ways could easily kick-in and prevent people from availing of this leave.  I sincerely hope that society has matured sufficiently that this will cost more than &euro;20 million because, hopefully, a lot more people will take advantage of this leave.

At its heart are the rights of a particular child to have time with and the benefit of having his or her father for the developmental stage which is a critical period in the life of a child, as research has shown.  The legislation also enshrines the rights of the father in question.  It is important that we send a clear message from this Chamber, as this Bill progresses, to employers that at the heart of this legislation are the rights and entitlements of the worker and that regardless of one's position, one has the right afforded to him to spend time with his child.<\/p> <p>Again, I welcome this positive legislation.

It is particularly gratifying as this is an area I worked on previously with the National Women's Council of Ireland, in my former role campaigning with Start Strong and ICTU trying to drive this forward.  There was positive engagement by the Government on this issue.  We had a very constructive engagement.<\/p> <p>The Bill is an important step forward in valuing care, in recognising care as the lifeblood of society and in addressing the balance of care between parents to recognise the role of fathers and other partners in caring and in the relationship with their children.  The legislation places a real, symbolic and concrete value on that.<\/p> <p>I commend some of the choices made.  It is excellent that paternity leave is a stand-alone right and separate from maternity leave.  It is a right that will be held by fathers and partners.  That was the right decision.  I also commend the fact that the legislation extends to people in same-sex partnerships and same-sex marriages, which is very important.<\/p> <p>I have a small concern but I think it is one we can address constructively in the future.  Paternity leave can be taken at quite a late stage.  I am concerned about that, given that the original purpose of the legislation was for paternity leave to be taken concurrently with maternity leave in order to allow parents to simultaneously bond with their new child and spend time caring for their child.  We must monitor that it does not become the case that paternity leave is always taken subsequently.  I know that is a capacity within the Bill but I believe that function rightly belongs to paid parental leave.  I have no doubt the Minister of State will drive forward progress on paid parental leave as the next step in that recognition of care within society.<\/p> <p>Lastly, I urge positive engagement by all parties within society with this Bill.  I urge employers to engage constructively and positively to see this as a way of valuing their employees and of recognising their employees as whole people with full lives.  I also urge that we have an awareness campaign to ensure that people avail of paternity leave.  Perhaps the Minister of State might speak to the Department of Social Protection and other Departments about an awareness campaign.<\/p> <p>I commend the Bill.

It is very important for women because it means that child care will no longer be seen as primarily or exclusively a women's issue.

These provisions are necessary, given the nature of the investigation involved, to ensure the commission can effectively perform its functions.  I am presenting the Bill on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality who has responsibility for the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, under which the IBRC commission of investigation was established.  I reiterate that the Government shares with the rest of the House a desire to ensure there will be an effective, efficient and timely investigation into the issues of significant public concern which have been raised in relation to IBRC.  This shared determination across the Oireachtas has underpinned the extensive consultation at all stages with the Opposition, initially by the Minister for Finance and subsequently by the Taoiseach.<\/p> <p>Before I outline the provisions of the Bill, I would like to set out the background to the commission of investigation and also mention some of the issues raised in the determinations and interim reports of the commission which have given rise to the provisions being considered.<\/p> <p>The commission of investigation into certain transactions conducted by the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation was established in June 2015 following the approval of a draft order by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The commission is charged with investigating matters which are considered by the Government and affirmed by the Houses to be of significant public concern in respect of IBRC and making any report required under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 on its investigation.  In accordance with its terms of reference, the commission is required to investigate certain transactions, activities and management decisions which occurred at IBRC between 21 January 2009, being the date of nationalisation of IBRC, and 7 February 2013, being the date of appointment of the special liquidators to IBRC, and which either resulted in a capital loss to IBRC of at least &euro;10 million during that period, whether by consequence of a single transaction or a series of transactions relating to the same borrower or entities controlled by the same borrower; or are specifically identified by the commission as giving rise or likely to give rise to potential public concern about the ultimate returns to the taxpayer.<\/p> <p>In November 2015 the sole member of the commission submitted an interim report.  The report sets out in detail the substantial work undertaken by the commission up to that point and the outcome of the interaction between it and the special liquidators, the Department of Finance, the directors of IBRC, the Central Bank of Ireland and the Irish Stock Exchange.  It is evident from the interactions, as detailed in the report, that a number of significant issues arose in the course of the commission&rsquo;s work, in particular issues regarding the ability of the commission to obtain and admit certain information and documents into evidence.  In the light of these concerns, the Taoiseach engaged with the leaders and representatives of the Opposition.  On behalf of the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, I thank those Members for their observations and contributions during that consultation process, on foot of which, a legislative solution was proposed.  It was agreed, again with members of the Opposition, to further consult the sole member of the commission on the proposed legislative response.  Following these consultations, the Taoiseach and the Opposition agreed on 2 June to proceed with the drafting of urgent legislation - the Bill before the House - to address the matters raised by the commission.<\/p> <p>As I said, the first interim report of the commission from November 2015 outlined a number of significant issues which had arisen in the course of the commission&rsquo;s work, including its view that the issue of confidentiality precluded it from admitting certain documents Into evidence; its view that the issue of legal professional privilege precluded it from admitting certain documents into evidence; its view that a duty of professional secrecy under section 118 of the Companies Act 1990 precluded it from receiving certain documents held by the Irish Stock Exchange; and the need to address matters relating to potential conflicts of interest and the management of the workload of the commission.  These are all issues which are being addressed, to the greatest extent possible, in the Bill.  As I said, there has been close consultation with the commission in the development of these provisions.  The approach adopted in the Bill is to introduce bespoke legislation which effectively applies the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 with specific provisions relating to the IBRC commission of investigation.<\/p> <p>The Bill contains nine sections, of which sections 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 provide for additional powers to be assigned to the IBRC commission of investigation which were identified as lacking under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 and consequently impeded the commission in performing its functions under the Act.  The investigation into the transactions and other acts undertaken by IBRC during the specified period is of a nature which warrants these additional powers being given to the commission.  Therefore, all of the provisions of the Bill provide for the IBRC commission of investigation solely and do not extend or in any way alter the application of the 2004 Act to other commissions of investigation, ongoing or otherwise.  Sections 5 and 8 make provision to assist the management of the workload of the commission and ensure potential conflicts of interest are avoided.<\/p> <p>Section 2 addresses certain powers of the commission.  Subsection (1) confirms that the commission may make such orders and determinations and give such directions as are necessary for the performance of its functions.  For that purpose the commission shall have all such powers, rights and privileges as are vested in the High Court or a judge of that court.  The need for such an amendment is set out in the determinations published by the commission - for instance, sections 7.90 to 7.94 of determination 1.  A similar provision is also available to tribunals of inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921, as amended.  One issue which arose during consultations and the drafting of the Bill is the extent to which this would draw the commission closer to the tribunals of inquiry model.  However, the commission format remains distinct in terms of its regular review and reporting back to the Government.<\/p> <p>Subsection (2) addresses the finding of the commission of investigation set out in its determinations and chapter 6 of the first interim report to the effect that the commission lacked the necessary statutory powers under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 to engage in a balancing of interests which may trigger the public interest exception to what is otherwise a duty of confidentiality.  This arose as the relevant section of the 2004 Act - section 21 - expressly stated nothing in that Act \"shall compel any person to disclose information or documents over which a duty of confidentiality is asserted and found by the Commission to apply\".  Subsection (2), therefore, confirms that the commission may admit documents in relation to which a duty of confidentiality is claimed.<\/p> <p>Subsection (2)(b) refers to Article 27 of the EU market abuse regulation.  Article 27 provides for the non-disclosure, on grounds of professional secrecy, of information received pursuant to that regulation.  This would apply to information received by the Irish Stock Exchange and is similar to the obligation in respect of professional secrecy under section 118 of the Companies Act 1990 and which is to be disapplied in respect of the disclosure of information by the Irish Stock Exchange under section 7 of the Bill.  The sole member of the commission has confirmed that there may be circumstances where he may request information which may fall under the provisions of the EU regulation.  Again, I reiterate that these provisions are introduced solely for the purpose of this investigation and the particular circumstances identified by the commission. Without the introduction of these provisions, the commission is clear that it&rsquo;s ability to carry out its work would be severely limited.<\/p> <p>A definition of \"document\" is introduced in section 2(3) so as to include tapes, discs and sound recordings, as well as written material.  Again, this is to ensure the commission will have access to all information needed to effectively conduct the investigation.<\/p> <p>Sections 3 and 4 are introduced to ensure the commission may seek the directions of the High Court or refer any question of law to that court on the performance of its functions.  It is clear from the determinations published by the commission that it had considered seeking the directions of the courts on certain matters but that the 2004 Act does not provide any mechanism for a commission to seek such directions.  Sections 3 and 4 make the necessary provisions.<\/p> <p>Section 5 is an important section and addresses two concerns identified by the commission.  The first relates to the efficient management of the workload of the commission.  As the House is aware, one aspect of the terms of reference for this commission is the investigation of transactions during the relevant period which involved capital losses to IBRC of more than &euro;10 million.  As noted In the interim report, 38 such transactions have been identified by the special liquidators to IBRC.  Effectively, this would involve up to 38 investigations.  I understand it has been agreed in consultation with the Opposition that the terms of reference for the commission will be amended so as to adopt a modular approach to these investigations.  However, in the light of the potential for a large number of investigations, the commission has recommended - it certainly appears prudent - the appointment of additional members to it.  While the appointment of more than one member to the commission is possible under the 2004 Act, the Act does not permit those members to operate in divisions or panels; rather, the members operate together as a single commission.  Therefore, this section of the Bill proposes that where an additional member or members are appointed to the commission, they operate in divisions and, importantly, that the report and findings of any single division be a report and findings of the commission as a whole.<\/p> <p>While it is not intended to appoint an additional member at this stage, this provision recognises and responds to the range of transactions potentially to be investigated by the commission.  Permitting it to sit in divisions will also mean that the concerns identified by it in its first interim report about a possible conflict of interest between a member of the commission in relation to any particular transaction can be avoided by allowing that transaction to be investigated without the involvement of that member, should the need arise.<\/p> <p>Section 6 addresses the disclosure of information by the special liquidators to IBRC to the commission of investigation.  Determination 1 of the commission addresses the assertions of a duty of confidentiality and legal professional privilege which have been asserted by the special liquidators and which the commission has found to apply.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The issues regarding the duty of confidentiality have been addressed through section 2 of the Bill, in respect of which I have spoken.  However, in its determination, the commission further found that it had no power under the 2004 Act to admit into evidence documents over which a claim of legal professional privilege was asserted and found to apply.  While it is understood that the special liquidators offered a limited waiver of legal privilege for certain transactions to the commission, none the less the commission considered that it could not proceed further or admit into evidence such documents.<\/p><p>It is clear from the commission&rsquo;s decision on legal advice privilege set out in determination 1 that the commission was only seeking to obtain those documents that the directors of IBRC have received in the past, which relate to legal advice they may have received in respect of the write-offs of certain loans by IBRC and are the subject of the current investigation.  While the special liquidators were willing to disclose the documents to the commission for the purpose of the investigation, they did not consent to the documents being provided to any third parties, although the special liquidators agreed to consider waiving privilege on a case by case basis.  The inability to forward such documents to the former directors of IBRC would, in the view of the commission, deprive them of their right to fair procedures and to respond to the commission in a meaningful way.<\/p><p>Section 6 addresses the concerns raised by the commission.  First, subsection (1) introduces a general requirement on the special liquidators to comply with all directions by the commission under the 2004 Act.  With respect to the assertion of legal privilege by the special liquidators in respect of documents previously received by the directors of IBRC, subsection (2) will amend the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act 2013 to insert a new provision Into section 9 of that Act. <\/p><p>Section 9 provides for the Minister for Finance to issue instructions and directions to the special liquidators and the new subsection (2A) to be inserted by the Bill will provide that the Minister may, for the purpose of enabling the commission of investigation to perform its functions, give a direction to the special liquidator to do or refrain from doing a specified act.  This may include a direction from the Minister to the special liquidators to waive legal professional privilege.  There is no obligation on the Minister to issue such a direction and it will only arise where the commission requests the Minister to do so and informs the Minister, in writing, that the direction is necessary to enable the commission to perform its functions and it is in the public Interest to do so.  The basis for issuing such a direction would be the connection to the purposes of the IBRC Act, as set out under section 3 of that Act and which, I remind this House, include \"to protect the interests of the taxpayer\".<\/p><p>Section 7 will disapply section 118 of the Companies Act 1990 to enable the Irish Stock Exchange to provide confidential information to the IBRC commission, which may admit it into evidence.  Determination 3 of the commission, published in April, concluded that certain documents sought from the Stock Exchange were confidential pursuant to section 118 which provides for professional secrecy in respect of documents obtained by the Stock Exchange in pursuance of its functions under Part V of the 1990 Act in relation to insider dealing.  As this is effectively a statutory duty of confidentiality, section 7 of the Bill will disapply it in respect of the disclosure of information to the commission.<\/p><p>In terms of the substantive provisions of the Bill, section 8 will amend the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 but only in so far as it applies to the IBRC commission of investigation.  Paragraph (a) amends the definition of \"document\" under the 2004 Act so that it replicates the definition under section 2 of this Bill.  Paragraph (b) amends section 34 of the 2004 Act, again only in so far as it applies to the IBRC commission.<\/p><p>Under section 34, a draft of any report by a commission of investigation must be distributed, in advance of submission to the specified Minister, to any person who is identified or identifiable in that report.  The provision in section 8(b) will limit the distribution of the report to persons in respect of whom there is an adverse finding.  This has been specifically requested by the commission to reduce the level of distribution which would otherwise be required on the basis that there is a strong likelihood of many persons being identified in the report but in respect of whom there would be no adverse finding.<\/p><p>Section 9 deals with the commencement of the legislation.  Senators will agree that although this is not a long Bill, it will provide significant additional powers to the commission of investigation into IBRC.  Given the conclusions and recommendations reached by the commission in the determinations and interim reports published to date, and following consultation with the Opposition and commission of investigation during the drafting of the Bill, all of these provisions are proposed to ensure the task set by the House in June 2015 is conducted as effectively as possible.  I remind Senators that the very significant public concerns regarding certain transactions carried out by IBRC, which were recognised and acknowledged by this House, must be addressed in a comprehensive manner.<\/p><p>I would like to return to a matter I briefly mentioned.  Given the number of transactions undertaken by IBRC, which have been identified and involve losses of greater than &euro;10 million, I know that amended terms of reference are being brought forward which propose a modular approach to the investigation with a focus in the first phase on the Siteserv transaction, being an issue of significant public concern raised in the House.  This is a pragmatic approach which will allow the commission to focus its efforts in the first phase.  A draft order with the revised terms of  reference will be brought before the Houses later this week for approval.  I also understand that, as requested by the commission under section 6(6) of the 2004 Act, the Taoiseach has recently agreed to extend the timeframe for the commission until the end of October 2016.  This will allow the commission to continue its preparatory work while the legislation is being enacted and the terms of reference amended as I have outlined.<\/p><p>I thank the leaders and members of the Opposition for their contribution in reaching a solution to the issues raised by the commission which would, if unresolved, have undermined the ability of the commission to reach findings in the investigations involved.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of Members.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#Z00400","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party supports the Bill, which implements a series of specific legislative recommendations by the commission of investigation into IBRC.  As the Minister indicated, the commission has encountered issues with legal and professional confidentiality which have impeded the completion of its work.  The Bill explicitly addresses these barriers and will enable the commission to issue a report by the already delayed October 2016 deadline.<\/p> <p>The commission of investigation into IBRC was established in July 2015 following continuous calls by Fianna F&aacute;il and other Opposition parties to uncover suspect actions surrounding the sale of Siteserv.  The commission encountered fundamental legal barriers to successfully completing its work.  Issues around legal privilege, professional secrecy, confidentiality and conflicts of interests were highlighted by the commission.  As I stated, the Bill explicitly and solely addresses these issues, which should have been addressed when the commission of investigation was established, rather than during its work.<\/p> <p>The Government initially vigorously resisted establishing a commission of investigation but retreated in the face of concerted public and political opposition.  Fianna F&aacute;il stated from the outset that the use of the Commission of Investigation Act 2004 would be necessary on account of a number of dubious activities around the Slteserv sale.  The Government&rsquo;s haphazard reaction was to grudgingly establish separate inquiries before finally conceding that it was necessary to use the Commission of Investigation Act.<\/p> <p>It is important to briefly outline the reasons for the establishment of a commission of investigation into IBRC.  Siteserv was sold by IBRC to a Denis O'Brien owned company at a loss to the State of &euro;119 million.  This loss was further reflected in other sales by IBRC.  The commission must question and address the following questions arising from the Siteserv transaction.  Why was there a surge in share dealing activity in Siteserv prior to its sale?  Why were shareholders in Siteserv paid &euro;5 million for an effectively insolvent company?  Why were other bidders apparently excluded from the sale process?  Was the Department of Finance kept fully informed of the sale process and what actions did departmental officials take on foot of concerns expressed about that process?  Why did the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, not provide vital information in response to parliamentary questions tabled in the D&aacute;il?  This series of questions needs to be fully investigated and answered by the commission of investigation.  I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House because it is important that the commission of investigation reports without further delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#AAA00200","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I support the Bill because the Cregan commission needs all necessary powers to discharge its functions.  With regard to the confidentiality issue raised by section 21 of the legislation, which I put before the Houses as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it has always been a mystery in my mind as to when an amendment was made to the section extending the confidentiality rule to virtually every transaction before a commission.  I have never been able to solve this mystery and I still ponder why it is the case.<\/p> <p>As Senator Diarmuid Wilson stated, this commission of investigation arises mainly out of the Siteserv controversy.  It is notable that on 25 April 2015, the former chairman of IBRC stated that the board had rejected a Department of Finance proposal to appoint a senior civil servant to the board on the basis that such an appointment would be unsuitable.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the same article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, he stated a Mr. Woodhouse had been kept out of discussions regarding Siteserv because he personally handled Mr. Denis O'Brien's relationship with IBRC.  He stated a different executive in IBRC, Mr. Tom Hunersen, had handled the Siteserv transaction.  This is worrying because, three years earlier, a posting appeared on the <i>broadsheet.ie<\/i>website suggesting Mr. Aynsley, Mr. Hunersen and Mr. O'Brien were socialising together at the time when the transaction in case was taking place.<br\/><br\/>It is also worrying that Mr. O'Brien was reported in 2014 by <i>The Irish Times<\/i>as having made a major investment in a Massachusetts-based IT firm in which Mr. Hunersen was one of the moving parties.  The former chairman of the IBRC claimed Mr. Woodhouse had stepped aside from this transaction.  He seems to have re-emerged recently in the context of the story in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that many Members of this House read last week.  Again, the question arises as to whether there is a connection between him and Mr. O'Brien.<br\/><br\/>A more fundamental question arises as to who is organising the campaign of intelligence-gathering of Mr. Hollingsworth, the so-called journalist engaged in coming to Members of this House, among others, and passing himself off as one seeking to identify the source of leaks about Mr. O'Brien's dealings with IBRC.  These are very serious issues.<br\/><br\/>This matter is particularly relevant because, according to the story in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, a major British security firm was the recipient of the material collected by Mr. Hollingsworth in Dublin.  We heard later, according to evidence given in the High Court, that a USB key appeared on the desk of Mr. O'Brien and that he, for the first time, discovered the material that Mr. Hollingsworth was privy to in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>The use of an English security firm in this respect is not a new phenomenon in Ireland.  We should remember also that there was elaborate industrial espionage and surveillance in the context of the takeover of the Independent News &amp;amp; Media group at the time between the O'Reilly interests and the O'Brien interests, if I may use that term.  In that case, newspaper reports indicated that 11 operatives operating from a Dublin hotel were engaged in fairly extensive surveillance of the then managing director of Independent News &amp;amp; Media and that it was eventually determined that an English espionage firm or intelligence-gathering firm called Esoteric lay behind that.  Surprisingly, Independent News &amp;amp; Media, which later came under the control of Mr. O'Brien, largely speaking, has been unable to work out who commissioned that investigation.<br\/><br\/>I am also worried in another respect.  It was reported in the media that Irish Water had concluded an extensive contract with a company in the Isle of Man chaired by Mr. Leslie Buckley and in which Mr. Denis O'Brien was a large investor.  He is described in its publicity material as a leading Irish entrepreneur.  The function of that company is to advise Irish Water against the hacking of its sites.  It appears the main business of this company in the Isle of Man, which is owned by Mr. O'Brien and chaired by Mr. Buckley, an associate of Mr. O'Brien, concerns computer security and countermeasures against computer hacking.  Although no particular figure was put on the computer security services of Irish Water, it is interesting that it was suggested in the media at the time that, over five years, &euro;1.2 million was spent on this kind of activity on the part of Irish Water.  One must bear in mind also that at least one of the newspapers controlled by Mr. O&rsquo;Brien has, since the emergence of the dispute about water charges and the legislation we considered in this House some days ago, run a fairly heavy campaign, with many editorials and articles, on the subject of Irish Water.  This is a serious matter.<br\/><br\/>I will finish on two points.  Last week in a different context, although Mr. O&rsquo;Brien had a walk-on part in it, the Ceann Comhairle, as Chairman of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, publicly queried whether it would be necessary to introduce a system of fines to strengthen the powers of the Chair to prevent the abuse of D&aacute;il privilege.  This House has its own Standing Orders, its independence and its own Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  As a member of that committee, I do not believe Members of this House are disposed to abusing their privilege at all, nor do I believe the use of financial penalties to preserve the privacy of important people the Irish political and economic environment should be permitted by this House.  I do not believe we should go down that road.  It is for the other House to make up its own mind on fines for its Members.<br\/><br\/>We must remember that these Houses are the defendants in a court action brought by Mr. O&rsquo;Brien.  He has sued the institutions of this State.  He has also sued individual Members of these Houses on occasion and has threatened to do so on many more occasions.  Free speech is very important.  As far as I am concerned, the Cregan commission is dealing with just one set of issues, the activities of the IBRC, only some of which involve Mr. O&rsquo;Brien or companies connected with him.<br\/><br\/>However, there are other major issues to be borne in mind arising from the Moriarty report, which found Mr. O&rsquo;Brien had indirectly channelled the guts of &euro;1 million to former Minister, Deputy Lowry, after the awarding of a telecommunications licence to him.  It found that elaborate efforts to deceive the Moriarty tribunal had been made, including the falsification of letters to cover up the involvement of the relevant parties.  I wish all speed and every success to the Cregan commission.  I welcome this legislation.  Members have an obligation to be fair but not to be entirely impartial but it is important that these issues be dealt with in a process that is fair and impartial and, above all, has the means of establishing the truth, because the Irish people do deserve the truth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#AAA00300","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the Bill.

We have lost time here but I hope the commission will be focused.  I agree with the modular approach; it is appropriate.  At least we can get answers on specifics as opposed to a myriad of issues, and we will not have to wait a very long time to get answers.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell made comments about the Ceann Comhairle.

However, I had expressed concern that if we were to go down that road, it would be perceived to be protecting the powerful and wealthy in society.  It is not appropriate but, as has been said, it is up to the other House to conduct its own affairs.  I hope this House would never succumb to that type of - to put it in simple terms - penal, schoolteacher-like approach.  The Members of this House who exposed the Siteserv issue and other matters have done the State enormous service.  It was incredible to see the lengths to which Mr. O'Brien went to silence that.  It beggars belief that the Houses of the Oireachtas are being sued by any individual.  I noted with interest, and followed very closely, the O'Reilly-O'Brien debacle at Independent News and Media and I learned a great deal in terms of the covert investigations run out of hotels in Dublin.  I did not know that went on, although it does not surprise me.  Given that the Houses of the Oireachtas have been sued, nothing surprises me any longer.  There is a great deal that is rotten in the corporate world in this country and we, as parliamentarians, have a duty to ensure it is rooted out.<\/p><p>When the IBRC liquidation happened, I thought we were looking at an avalanche.  The operation was so big that it was probably very difficult to control, especially when the country was in the position of disposing of assets to reduce its debt and exposure.  We did not hold our nerve as we should have done.  We see now how things have improved.  Any schoolchild will tell one that there are peaks and troughs in economics.  We were in a very depressed trough at the time, but matters were always going to improve.  The people went through a great deal of hardship to ensure the country was brought to a better position.  It was a great pity that IBRC, under the direction of the Department of Finance and others, felt it necessary to offload billions of euro worth of assets, not just at home but abroad as well.  We panicked and should have held our nerve, but that is only my view.  Had we held our nerve and done things in a more controlled fashion, we might not be in this situation now and the commission of investigation might not have been necessary.  We are where we are, however, and the Bill is very important.  It is vital that it be passed as quickly as possible.  If it needs to be amended still further on the suggestion of the commission of investigation that it needs more powers, we should not be found wanting in amending it accordingly.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for providing an overview of the Bill.  It is very positive that there was engagement with the Opposition.  That is new politics in reality.  This morning, a Senator asked for a definition of \"new politics\" and this is a clear one.  A year ago, there would not have been what my briefing note refers to as \"extensive consultation\" with Opposition parties.  The Opposition would have been given a courteous and short briefing but there would not have been extensive discussions and negotiations.  That epitomises new politics and the Bill, when enacted, will be all the better for it.  It will facilitate getting to the root of at least some of the problems caused as a result of the liquidation of IBRC and what followed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#BB00200","speaker":"1416","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":139,"content":"<p>This is a last-ditch attempt to salvage a commission of investigation the Government never wanted.  It remains open to debate whether it was by design or by flaw that the commission was so badly set up in the first instance.  Nevertheless, I hope that what comes out of the Bill and the new terms of reference is a commission of investigation that can do its job.<\/p> <p>IBRC is a zombie institution comprising the completely discredited Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  These banks have cost the Irish people &euro;64 billion and became an excuse for Fianna F&aacute;il and then Fine Gael-Labour Party Government to undermine the rights and hollow out the public services of the Irish people.  These banks were the worst of the worst and represent a black stain on Ireland's reputation.  They are a reminder of how the political class failed us.  We should remember that, in February 2013, a decision was taken in the middle of the night to liquidate IBRC. The debt was not wound down, of course, and our children will be paying it off for a long time to come.  Indeed, my son, who is 14, will be 54 by the time the burden of debt is lifted.  The cost of servicing the debt is &euro;7 billion a year.  That is &euro;7 billion that could be spent on health, education, job creation and infrastructure.<\/p> <p>The biggest issue with the Bill is that anything that happened after the liquidation date is still out of bounds, despite the many questions that have been raised about what has happened since.  Despite involving billions of euro belonging to Irish citizens, the process is still completely opaque.  When Deputy Pearse Doherty started to ask the Minister for Finance about write-downs at IBRC, the latter did not take it very seriously.  Indeed, it took a great deal of work and cajoling to get him to accept that there was a problem in the first instance.  Then the Taoiseach appointed the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine the issue.  Eventually, we got a commission of investigation.  As we know now, it was set up with little thought regarding the legal obstacles involved.  The interim report last November highlighted the biggest issues, including confidentiality and problems relating to the timeline.  As such, we are here again trying to put Humpty Dumpty together.  It is interesting that Fianna F&aacute;il is supporting the Bill but not the NAMA investigation.  At least, that was last week's position.  I am not sure what is the position this week.<\/p> <p>The country cannot stand still because the lawyers of one of the bank's clients are of the view that he has the power to stop any investigation he chooses.  There is always a danger of litigation but that is not a valid reason to stop looking out for the public interest.  The people remember that these allegations were sparked by certain individuals getting away with sweetheart deals.  They believed what they heard because it made sense.  They know there are small cliques with enormous power operating in the country and that these play by their own rules.  The corruption and cronyism did not, of course, end with Tom Gilmartin's experiences with Fianna F&aacute;il.  This Government continued to preside over the very corruption, cronyism and greed which are the root cause of our inability to provide for our citizens.  These are not victimless crimes.  Very few politicians, bankers or businessmen will ever go to prison no matter what they do, but the public insists that we do our best to find the truth.<\/p> <p>Nobody was surprised that the special liquidators kicked up a fuss when the commission came sniffing around.  KPMG is the wrong company for this job because it is part of the protected elite and has so many fingers in pies in the State that it could never carry out the work effectively.  One of the problems here is that the previous Government appointed the fox to guard the henhouse.  KPMG was the auditor at Irish Nationwide, which is one chunk of IBRC.  It has an interest in the liquidation that goes beyond what it is paid to do.  Its interest is not that of the Irish people.  The new power given to the Minister to direct the special liquidators is at the core of the Bill and is long overdue.  The Minister should not be hesitant to use the powers as necessary.<\/p> <p>The terms of reference encompass a modular approach.  The Siteserv transaction must be the focus of the first module.  It is the reason we have a commission of investigation and is where the public interest is most focused.  After that, it is clearly logical to home in on the largest transactions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The notion of a more general area of investigation being added to the first module should not distract from the Siteserv issue.

Any increase in the budget must be justified and implemented tightly.<\/p><p>We support the Bill in the hope it can salvage the mess that was caused by Fianna F&aacute;il and made by Fine Gael.  It only considers half the picture because it stops at the point of liquidation.  The most important issue now is to get to the truth about Siteserv.  This is where our focus and that of the commission should be firmly fixed.  Members should imagine all the money that could be saved if only those who consider themselves to be untouchable told the truth.  We must make them tell the truth and I hope the Bill helps with that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#CC00200","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  We had the pleasure of his company for the debate on the Paternity Leave and Benefit Bill as well.<\/p><p>On behalf of the Labour Party, I support the Bill and I wish the Cregan commission every success on its fact-finding mission into the details of the potential losses at IBRC.  The Bill helps the commission to investigate losses incurred by IBRC and, accordingly, the State and the taxpayer between January 2009 and February 2013.  Everyone will be aware of the legal obstacles faced by the commission during this work and, indeed, they were identified at the time of the writing the first interim report to the Taoiseach on 12 November 2015.  The commission made clear that, in its view, certain legislative changes would be required to overcome legal difficulties in respect of matters, including bank and customer confidentiality, legal professional privilege and so forth, which the Minister of State outlined.  Workload management is also an issue and it is an important component of the legislation.  Access to documents and information is an issue but capacity of the commission to do this work is also an issue.<\/p><p>The is a bespoke Bill, as the Minister of State said.  It is not designed to amend the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 generally but rather to provide for specific amendments to enable this commission to fulfil its task effectively and efficiently.  It has become clear from the two interim reports produced by the commission in November 2015 and April of this year that additional time will be needed.  The Minister of State said that its work will extend to the end of October next.  Unfortunately, that has been a feature of commissions of investigation over the years.  Inevitably, terms of reference are drafted too broadly and as commissions embark on their work, the timeframes become too tight.  However, the commission-of-investigation model is a better, more cost-effective and efficient model than that relating to tribunals of inquiry.  I pay tribute to Senator McDowell, who, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, introduced this model as a clear improvement on what had become the hugely cumbersome and costly tribunal process.<\/p><p>While the costs of running the commission are not insignificant, they come nowhere near the cost to the State of the write-offs under investigation by it.  Others have referred to the write-offs of IBRC loans in respect of Siteserv, which cost more than &euro;100 million.  However, in total, there were a number of transactions in the period covered with write-offs greater than &euro;100 million.  Clearly, the work of the commission will be invaluable in establishing the facts of these transactions.  I looked into the issue of the estimated cost of the commission and the latest approximation I have is from the second interim report.  Up to April 2016, the cost was estimated to be approximately &euro;600,000 to cover salaries, legal bills, rent, etc., which is relatively low compared to the amounts under investigation.<\/p><p>As Members of both Houses have indicated, the work of the commission was due in no small part to the extensive work done by Deputy Catherine Murphy.  She took on significant work trying to establish the facts and raise concerns about the Siteserv transaction, to which others have referred.  A good deal of litigation is ongoing, not least the litigation against these Houses being taken by Mr. Denis O'Brien.  Those who read the two-page spread on this in last Saturday's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>will be conscious that these are highly complex matters.  In a nutshell, the commission is being asked to investigate potential irregularities and flaws in transactions that may have cost the State and, therefore, the taxpayer millions of euro.All of us will support the need for the commission to establish the facts around these transactions in an effective and timely manner.<\/p><p>I refer to the issue of the workload management of the commission.  Section 5 of the Bill will enable the commission to operate in divisions.  That has become an issue because the commission will need the facility to appointment an additional member or members, if necessary, to work in divisions.  Conflict of interest is also an issue.  The Minister of State identified that the commission, in its first interim report, pointed out that where there is a conflict of interest involving a member of the commission in respect of a transaction, that transaction could be investigated by another member if divisions were permitted, which is important.<\/p><p>The revised terms of reference deal with workload management.  A motion has been tabled referring to a Government order clarifying and amending the original terms of reference.  It is sensible that a modular approach would be adopted and that the commission would initially be asked to report on the single identified transaction only - on which most public attention has been focused - namely, that relating to Siteserv which was raised in the Oireachtas.  It makes sense to revise the terms of reference in this regard to assist the commission to ensure its workload is manageable and does not become unduly cumbersome, given the breadth of the original terms of reference and the number of transactions it was intended to cover.  I am happy to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#DD00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":142,"content":"<p>In welcoming the Minister of State, I must point out that it is important that the issue before us, which is a matter of public concern, should be addressed and investigated.  Anomalies and irregularities in transactions that potentially cost the taxpayer must be investigated.  The Government's approach to this has been transparent, notwithstanding the fact that Deputy Catherine Murphy brought the issue to the floor of the D&aacute;il.  The interim report called for different changes and we should all consider them.<\/p> <p>Mr. Justice Cregan deserves our support in his work.  It is important that we receive the report in a timely manner.  The last thing people want is an ambling process whereby the work of the commission continues beyond the timeframe.  I am not sure if the Minister of State outlined the date by which the commission must report and I apologise if he did.  A timeframe is crucial and it should be adhered to.  Equally, it is clear, not only from the debate in the Oireachtas but also from media commentary, that it is important that the full facts be obtained.  In whatever guise or form the truth comes out, it is important that we have clarity and that the investigation brings certainty.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State referred to the need \"to ensure that the commission can effectively perform its functions\".

It calls for legislative change, which we all accept.  Senator Bacik mentioned the terms of reference.  I am coming in a roundabout to where I want to get.  We all welcome the Commissions of Investigation Act model.  Those of us who were not Members of the Oireachtas when we had the tribunal of inquiry model remember every day there was media reporting and people made their names through impersonating the people before the tribunal and good luck to them.  However, let us consider the cost and time.<\/p><p>This brings me to the point I really wanted to speak about today.  I will be very careful not to stray into any matters before the courts.  I refer to the powers we give to Oireachtas committees.  I accept the people have voted on the matter; I have no issue with the people being sovereign and they make the decision.  It is how we, as Members of the Oireachtas, carry out our business in terms of our committee system.  I refer, in particular, to the role of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I was formerly the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, was a very fine Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  If the Committee of Public Accounts seizes on an issue, then everybody else has to walk away and cannot touch the matter, cannot debate the matter, cannot call in witnesses and cannot carry out any work related to it.<\/p><p>I wish to make a broader linked point.  We need to look at how that rule is interpreted.  The Minister of State in his remarks here said that the commission of investigation had to have its legislative powers changed.  I believe - I have no skin in the game other than being a parliamentarian now - that if we are to charge Members of the Oireachtas with being the taxpayers' representatives or the citizens' representatives, then how they carry out their duties requires us, as Members of the Oireachtas, to change how we do our business.  I may incur the wrath of some people.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik referred to divisions in section 5 in terms of how they do their business.  Similarly for the Houses of the Oireachtas committee system, we must find a mechanism whereby different committees can work together.  The proof of this was when the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and I held joint meetings of Committees on Health and Children and Justice, Defence and Equality on certain matters.  I do not believe the Committee of Public Accounts is the only committee that has the capacity or should have the autonomy to do work on an issue; there should be a joint approach with different committees.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for bringing the Bill before the House.  I hope the other powers that be will pay notice to what I said.  I say that not out of any malice.  I want to see our committee system, which was a very effective voice in the last Parliament, continue.  That means we must change how we do our business.  The role of the Committee of Public Accounts needs to be reviewed in the context of seizing on matters to the preclusion of other committees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#DD00300","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I was extra indulgent with the Senator, who is Leader of the Seanad, as I want to ensure quality answers to my questions tomorrow and on subsequent days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#EE00200","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate.

The sole member of the commission acknowledges the significant task facing the commission in his reports.

The issues being addressed today only came to light during the preparatory work of the commission itself.  These are set out in detail in determination 1 published in November 2015.  Following that determination by the commission, the Government immediately engaged in consultation with the Opposition to address the problems identified by the commission.<\/p> <p>I welcome Senator McDowell's support for the Bill.

The commission also confirms in the second interim report that while the special liquidators initially claimed legal professional privilege over a number of documents furnished to the commission, the special liquidator subsequently, following a request from the commission, informed the commission that it was willing to waive that privilege in respect of the Siteserv transaction.

However, these appointments must first be approved by resolutions of both D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  At its meeting of 13 July 2016, the Government agreed to propose, for consideration by this House under today's motion, the appointment of named persons to be members of the new authority.  I am today, therefore, seeking the approval of the House for those people being nominated under this motion to be appointed by the Government as the members of the new authority.<\/p> <p>The persons concerned are the nominees of the nominating bodies named in the Act and this is the sole process whereby these names have been selected.  I will return to that subject in a few moments since it is important to note the independence safeguards contained in the particular nominating process in this legislation.<\/p> <p>In tandem with consideration of this motion by the House, the T&aacute;naiste has now signed a commencement order in respect of certain provisions of Part 1 and Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, as necessary to support the start-up of the new legal services regulatory authority.<\/p> <p>Further parts of the Act will be commenced on a phased basis in the autumn as the new authority gets up and running and ready to take over key areas, such as inspections, public complaints and the new legal business models.<\/p> <p>The sequencing of these further commencements is being planned very carefully.  As Senators will appreciate, the establishment of this authority and the assumption by it of regulatory oversight of all legal practitioners in Ireland, including handling of complaints against legal practitioners and the authority&rsquo;s responsibility to oversee the operation and opening up of the legal services market in Ireland, are all major public regulatory steps.  Great care will have to be taken to ensure that the steps are correctly executed and that the replacement of existing regulatory regimes leaves no gaps.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Under this motion, it is also being proposed that the relevant appointments shall be with effect from the establishment day of the new regulatory authority, which the T&aacute;naiste will fix by order to be 1 October 2016.  I understand that the T&aacute;naiste will be making the requisite order to that effect shortly under section 7 of the Legal Services Regulation Act.  The setting of 1 October 2016 as establishment day will give momentum to the establishment and coming into operation of the new legal services regulatory authority.  It will also provide greater focus in the implementation of the structural reforms now set out in the Legal Services Regulation Act.<\/p><p>In very broad terms, the main levers of this reform are as follows.  First, there will be the new and independent legal services regulatory authority, with responsibility for oversight of both solicitors and barristers.  Second, there will be an independent complaints system dealing with legal professional misconduct, which will provide a first port of call for the public in making complaints independent of the legal professional bodies.  There will also be a new and independent legal practitioners&rsquo; disciplinary tribunal to adjudicate on serious misconduct in regard to both solicitors and barristers.  Third, there will be an enhanced legal costs regime, bolstered by a set of legal costs principles, which also places more extensive obligations on both solicitors and barristers to keep clients informed about the details of their legal costs.  Separately, the new office of the legal costs adjudicator will assume the role of the existing Office of the Taxing Master and keep a public register of its legal costs determinations.  Fourth, there will be a framework for new legal business models.  These will include the early introduction of legal partnerships between barristers and solicitors, or between barristers themselves, limited liability partnerships for solicitors and public consultations on other business alternatives such as multidisciplinary practices.<\/p><p>To underpin the independence of the new legal services regulatory authority, the members of the authority are nominated to the Government by ten nominating bodies specified in section 9 of the 2015 Act.  These bodies have been purposely set in the legislation to represent a balance between the interests of lawyers and those of consumers and other stakeholders in the regulation of legal services and of legal costs.  Membership is also staggered by the drawing of lots at the first meeting of the authority as a result of which there will be some four-year members and some three-year members.  This ensures the continuity of expertise and functions of the new regulatory authority.<\/p><p>The authority is to consist of 11 members, of whom a majority, that is to say, six members, including the chairperson, are to be lay persons nominated by the six prescribed non-legal bodies.  The remaining five members are nominated by the prescribed legal bodies.  Each prescribed body, with the exception of the Law Society, which nominates two members, has nominated one person for appointment as member of the new authority.  In the case of all of the bodies except the Law Society, each body was also required to nominate a substitute nominee of the opposite gender to their primary nominee in order to facilitate gender balance - the authority must have no fewer than four members who are women and no fewer than four members who are men.  The Law Society has two nominees, reflecting the fact that solicitors outnumber barristers being regulated under the 2015 Act by four to one, with some 8,000 practising solicitors as compared with some 2,000 practising barristers.<\/p><p>The key requirement of the Legal Services Regulation Act is that the nominees must have knowledge and expertise in specified areas, for example, in the provision of legal services, competition, legal training and education, dealing with complaints against members of regulated professions, the needs of consumers of legal services, business and commercial matters and professional standards regulation.  The nominees and their nominating bodies are as follows: Angela Black, Citizens Information Board; Don Thornhill, Higher Education Authority; Deirdre McHugh, Competition and Consumer Protection Commission; Gerry Whyte, Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission; Stephen Fitzpatrick, Institute of Legal Costs Accountants; Dermot Jewell, Consumers Association of Ireland; David Barniville, Bar Council; Joan Crawford, Legal Aid Board; Nicholas Kearns SC, Honourable Society of King&rsquo;s Inns; and Geraldine Clarke and James MacGuill, Law Society.<\/p><p>The Government has also agreed at its meeting of 13 July 2016 to appoint one of the nominees under today&rsquo;s motion, Dr. Don Thornhill, to be chairperson of the new authority.  The power is given to the Government under the 2015 Act to make that appointment but this is, of course, subject to the candidate having been first approved as a member of the authority by a motion of both Houses.  Among his many achievements as a holder of senior public offices, Dr. Thornhill has led the National Competitiveness Council in its campaign to cut legal costs for consumers and enterprise.  He is a respected public figure and will bring much experience, knowledge and clout to the role of chair.  As such, he should provide the inaugural authority with the kind of direction and vision needed to be a successful and highly-regarded independent regulator that will enjoy the confidence of the public for the years to come.<\/p><p>I believe Senators will agree that the nomination and appointment procedures for the regulatory authority, which include seeking the necessary approval under today&rsquo;s motion, have great integrity by way of protecting the interests of all stakeholders concerned, along with the independence of lawyers in the discharge of their duties to their clients and to the courts.  It is a model that was introduced by Government amendment in direct response to independence concerns that were raised in 2011 at the time of initial publication of the Legal Services Regulation Bill.  The approval of this House for appointment of the persons being nominated to be members of the new authority under this motion would be a key moment in the history of our legal services and legal costs regimes.  By the same token, such approval would also enable the new members of the authority to hit the ground running, to independently recruit their chief executive and thereby spearhead the coming into operation of the new legal services regulatory authority.  I commend this motion to the Seanad for its considered agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#EE01000","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for addressing the House.  I have an interest in legal services legislation as I am a solicitor in a small solicitors' practice with two practitioners and three support staff.  I cautiously welcome the Bill as I think it will give the public and legal practitioners more certainty and confidence when dealing with each other and with professional bodies.<\/p> <p>The Bill intends to bring transparency and end the system of self-regulation which applied in the past to both the Bar Council and the Law Society.  Most professions today, including auctioneering and the Garda, are succumbing to the idea of being regulated by an authority.  For example, the Garda Commissioner came before the Policing Authority recently and the regulatory authority for auctioneers was set up in order to protect both auctioneers and the public.  In that light, I very much welcome the idea of moving away from self-regulation in the legal profession so the process of how solicitors and barristers work is more transparent and the public have more confidence in what happens with their work.<\/p> <p>I understand the cost of setting up this authority will be &euro;1 million but that it will ultimately be self-financing.  As I outlined, I am a sole practitioner.  There are many costs involved in being a sole practitioner and it is not some big gravy train, as some of the big firms might be.  We are a small business and we struggle every month with rates, accommodation and staffing.  This authority will mean another fee and, given the Law Society will still be in place, this will double up on professional subscriptions.  Therefore, I would like to ensure that this cost is not just put onto the bills for the public at the end of the day and transferred down in that way.  It is a point the Minister of State should be mindful of when the authority is set up.<\/p> <p>I welcome the idea of limited liability partnerships.  This will give more protection to practitioners than to the public because it will give practitioners a corporate personality, meaning they will not be sued.  As a result, their neck is not on the line and they can hide behind the veil of corporate responsibility.  I believe this will increase investment in legal professions and will ultimately increase the standard of legal services, all of which will be passed on to the public.<\/p> <p>With regard to the composition of the authority, I welcome the fact the board will mostly comprise lay people because, as a result, the public interest will be at the forefront of the authority's day-to-day running.  Most importantly, I am glad the complaints mechanism will be put to the fore of the authority so complaints are dealt with expediently and professionally, which is to the benefit of both the public and the members who are being complained of.<\/p> <p>I was a barrister and then transferred to work as a solicitor, which is a very difficult and costly transition.  I hope this Bill gets rid of any barriers so practitioners can be both barristers and solicitors and the transfer is not a big issue.  To take a European perspective, the Continent has lawyers without any difference between barristers and solicitors.  While I do not know how my colleagues in the Law Library will like it, I think it this is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>I was a barrister and then transferred to work as a solicitor, which is a very difficult and costly transition.

The responsibility will be on the legal services regulatory authority to demonstrate its independence from the legal profession, a point touched on by the previous speaker.  In order to show that it is effective, we suggest that the Oireachtas justice committee should invite members of the authority to appear before the committee at a later stage to discuss their work.  I hope this is something they would be willing to do as part of regular engagement and interaction and to bring feedback to Members of both Houses through the committee.  It will, of course, be two years before they report back formally, so such a move might be an opportunity for them to come to the committee to sustain that engagement with the Parliament.<\/p><p>We are hopeful too that the new authority will address matters of codes of conduct, admission requirements to the legal professions, conflicts of interest and the long-standing need to address the barriers to public interest litigation that exist within this jurisdiction, as the Minister of State is aware.  Indeed, I need not tell anyone in the Chamber that conflicts of interest are a major issue for the public when it comes to major firms.  This problem has generated a series of confidence issues among the broader public.  I do not think I need to go into particular cases because people will be well aware of them.<\/p><p>While this motion is a step in the right direction, it is clear that real changes to the legal profession will take at least another decade.  That is why I would like to emphasise the importance of engagement with the Parliament.  I appreciate this will not be done through the Minister of State but I imagine he will consider lending his support and bringing whatever influence he can to bear to ensure that authority members are engaging with us regularly and that we have a positive oversight role.  This does not mean veering into interference but rather that we have an opportunity, on behalf of the people we represent, who have long-standing and understandable concerns, to ensure that this body is operating as effectively as it can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#FF00300","speaker":"1413","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and this important motion to approve the establishment of the legal services regulatory authority.  I should declare my interest as someone who was for many years a practising barrister and still an external examiner for the King's Inns.  Also, of course, I know many of the nominees to the authority personally and I have worked with several of them.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State and colleagues will be well aware, we had a long debate around this legislation over a protracted time.  Indeed, the Minister of State was the chairman of the justice committee on which I served.  We had hearings on this legislation as well.  I feel a strange sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>in returning to look at the make-up of the authority.  However, it is welcome it has reached this stage.  Many of us thought we might never get to this point.  I say as much as a strong supporter of reform of the legal profession.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh spoke of the potential for a merged profession.  It is welcome that the Bill allows the exploration of that along with the exploration of other important reforms like the opening up of professional legal education to other bodies beyond the Law Society of Ireland and King's Inns.  These are important future reforms envisaged in the Act.<\/p><p>I looked back over the Second Stage debate on the Legal Services Regulation Bill held in the House on 13 May 2015.  At the time, I pointed out in respect of the independent legal services regulatory authority two key positive components which, I believe, are reflected in the make-up of the members that we see listed before us today.  First, the Act provides for a lay majority on the authority.  That is immensely important and is part of an increased momentum or culture around regulation of professions.  Regulatory oversight of all professions now requires far greater input from lay persons and I very much welcome that.  Second, we have a gender balance on the authority.  I note that four of the 11 names are women, this represents 36%.  It is a far better figure than the corresponding figure for Members of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>It is clear from any reading of the Act and to anyone who is familiar with the Act that a key component of the new regime of oversight of the legal professions in the Act is this authority.  This body is essential.  As the Minister of State noted, the authority has a range of functions which are central to the carrying out of the new regime under the Act.  Essentially, the authority will assume regulatory oversight of all legal practitioners in Ireland.  It will handle complaints against legal practitioners.  It will oversee the operation and opening up of the legal services market as well as the issues that I have already referred to - remarkably important issues for the future of the legal professions - in other words, the issue of merger and the issue of legal training.<\/p><p>We require a robust and an effective independent authority to carry out these functions effectively.  I am glad to see from the names before us that we have people who are of immense integrity and who will be well able to carry out their functions very well indeed.  It is also worth welcoming the appointment of Dr. Don Thornhill, who, as the Minister of State has said, has now been appointed as the chairperson of the authority.  I welcome the fact that the establishment day has now been set as 1 October this year.  All of these developments are welcome.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State indicate whether there is any timeframe for the recruitment of a chief executive?  Clearly, that is another important component to ensure this new authority gets up and running and hits the ground running.  It has several important functions.  There are several times set out in the Act within which the authority must look at issues around future regulation of the professions.  It is important that the establishment day has been set, members have been appointed and that we have a chairperson.  All of these are welcome announcements but we need to know when we are likely to see a chief executive appointed in order that the authority can really begin its work properly.  We all wish the authority the best for the future in the performance of its important functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#GG00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Like everyone in the House, I welcome this development.  I remember when the last Oireachtas started in 2011 the Minister at the time, Alan Shatter, proposed the controversial Legal Services Bill.  It was amended and watered down and evolved into what was brought over the line towards the autumn of the last Administration.  Some of us would have preferred to see the initial proposals of Mr. Shatter get over the line but, obviously, many vested interests lobbied somewhat successfully to have elements of the Bill changed.  However, whatever way we look at it, it is a positive development that we now have legal services legislation.<\/p> <p>It is even more positive that we have the legal services regulatory authority because the legal profession was the one profession that was self-regulating for far too long.  The people should have taken this issue by the scruff of the neck a long time ago but they did not.  Thankfully, as a result of the last Administration, we are in a position to support the appointment of a fine team under an exceptionally fine chairperson, Dr. Thornhill, who will take the reins of the legal services regulatory authority.  I have no doubt the authority will have singular credibility because the calibre of the people proposed by the various stakeholders and nominating bodies.  They have been approved by Cabinet and recommended to the Houses of the Oireachtas for final approval.<\/p> <p>It is a great day for the legal profession in this country.  It baffled me why the legal profession was so afraid of regulation and why it lobbied so powerfully and intensively on this issue.  Who is afraid of regulation?  No one should be afraid of regulation.  Many other sectors in the country are regulated.  Some of them are not as regulated as they should have been.  Unfortunately, we had a culture of light-touch regulation in the country and we see have seen where that got us.  However, the legal profession was not regulated at all.  It regulated itself, which was bizarre.  I do not think that happens anywhere else in the world.  After much toing and froing and much lobbying we have now an Act that we can stand over.  I have often said it in the House and I will say it again: all the legislation we bring through the House can evolve, change and be amended.  We will see how it works.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If the legal regulatory authority comes back to us and says that it needs more powers, we should not be found wanting in giving it more powers and in amending the legal services Act.<\/p><p>It was an absolute privilege to have been a member of the justice committee for five years when the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, was the Chairman of the committee.  We produced some very fine reports and work on this Bill.  One issue that the Minister of State will recall discussing in the committee was the whole question of e-conveyancing.  Various people came before the committee and gave evidence on the benefits of e-conveyancing.  Not alone would it save a substantial amount of money for the clients who are buying and selling property, it would also save a huge amount of time.  We would have a situation where, instead of it taking a month to six weeks to process a house because of documentation going from one stakeholder to another, it would be done in a week.  E-conveyancing is the way forward.  Many other industries in this country are now managed effectively by ICT.  There is absolutely no reason the law industry cannot embrace the very latest in ICT.  I believe the Government should look at making a once-off payment available to facilitate the establishment and roll-out of e-conveyancing.  Perhaps the Minister of State is not in a position to comment on that now and I am not expecting him to because it is somewhat off script.<\/p><p>What we have in terms of the legal services regulatory authority is the beginning of a long process of reforming the legal profession.  Hopefully, we will see a situation in which the ordinary and decent people of this country engage in legal services in a much more competitive environment and no longer have to endure exorbitant costs.  Whether it is the simple transaction of buying a house, getting legal counsel or opinion, or a more protracted and lengthy court case, hopefully the people of Ireland will get more value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#GG00300","speaker":"1416","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>The Senator is way over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#HH00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I know the Cathaoirleach has a certain interest in this area as well and I am sure that he would agree with my sentiments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#HH00300","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>That will not change my time restrictions, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#HH00400","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>\"A\" for effort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#HH00500","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Senators for their contributions to our discussion of the motion.  It is a motion which, along with a similar motion that will be put before the D&aacute;il for its consideration on Thursday, can enable the formal appointment of the 11 nominated members of the new legal services regulatory authority.  The immediate working objective is to obtain the required approval of the appointment of the nominated members by the two Houses in order that they can set about the early recruitment of their own chief executive.<\/p> <p>I note that Senator Bacik and others questioned the issue of the appointment of the chief executive.  The chief executive will be appointed by the authority itself and not by the Government.  The authority is independent and the Government has nothing at all to do with that.  We will offer job specifications and other supports to the authority.  Obviously, we would be anxious to get it moving as quickly as possible in order that we can have the appointment as quickly as possible following the establishment day and that there will not be any delay.  Any supports required will be made available.<\/p> <p>Administrative provisions are being made in support of the public recruitment by the new authority for suitable and qualified persons for that post.  A start-up support team is also being established and a suitable premises identified from which the new authority can commence its operations.  These are the initial steps that will enable the members and the chief executive of the new regulatory authority to oversee and drive the establishment of the new legal services regulatory regime and shape it in the discharge of its powers and functions.  It is planned at the stage we are now entering of setting up the new regulatory authority that it will include the phased commencement of parts of the Act, such as those dealing with legal costs, the new office of the legal costs adjudicator, the role of practicing barristers and pre-action protocols.<\/p> <p>I would like to highlight a few elements of the new legal costs transparency obligations of the 2015 Act.  These will apply to both solicitors and barristers in charging clients for their services.  For example, all legal practitioners will be obliged to provide much more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients.  This will be in the form of a notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions.  A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client.  When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to go ahead with further proceedings.  An aggrieved client will also have the option of applying for the adjudication of disputed legal costs by the reformed and modernised office of the legal costs adjudicators, which is currently known as the Taxing Master's office.  The Act sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of legal costs principles in support of the cost adjudication process.  There will be a publicly accessible register of determinations regarding the outcomes and reasons for decisions of the legal costs adjudicators.<\/p> <p>Following the establishment of the authority, its appointment of a chief executive and the initial commencement of parts of the Act along the lines I have just mentioned, the key provisions centred around Part 16 on the new public complaints procedures, professional conduct procedures, disciplinary procedures and the appointment of the new legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal will be commenced.  The managed roll-out and commencement of these functions is planned for the autumn.  This is being done in order to allow adequate time and preparation to ensure their effectiveness and success as crucial components of the new regulatory framework.<\/p> <p>Let us not lose sight of the fact that this new complaints framework will be a regulatory watershed.  Members of the public who are aggrieved at the services they have received from a legal practitioner, whether a barrister or solicitor, will now make their complaints to the independent legal services regulatory authority.  They will no longer do so through the legal professional bodies as they do at present.  Senator Conway spoke about a watering down of the Act.  I remind the House that this Act, when fully commenced, will provide as a matter of law that barristers and solicitors may practice through the new business model set out in the Act.  That is important to note.<\/p> <p>The new legal practitioners discipline tribunal, established under the 2015 Act, will deal with matters of serious misconduct relating to solicitors and barristers.  This single independent tribunal will, in time, replace the respective and separately operating conduct tribunals that deal with barristers and solicitors at the moment.  The 2015 Act also sets out a clear path to new legal partnerships, business models involving barrister-barrister partnerships and barrister-solicitor partnerships, which will allow for such partnerships to open for business in competition with the more traditional lawyer structures, which will remain a practicing option.<\/p> <p>I emphasise that the new regulatory authority will not stand still as a regulator.  Under the Legal Services Regulation Act, it will conduct a programme of work consistent with its mandate.  For example, it will be carrying out public consultations and reporting with further legislative recommendations over its first four years in office.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill spoke about the Act being kept under review.  Specific provisions have been made for the conduct of periodic reviews of the operation of the Legal Services Regulation Act, the first of which is to take place 18 months after the establishment of the new regulatory authority.  These periodic reviews of the Act will occur in addition to the normal annual strategic and business planning obligations of the new authority.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will be a part of this new exercise.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile made some points about the justice committee.  I thank Members for their comments about my stewardship of it in the past.  I am sure the committee will also be able to engage with members of this authority, as it does with many others.  It is probably one of the busiest committees in the Oireachtas, as I am sure the Senator will find out.<\/p> <p>Under the Legal Services Regulation Act, a programme of work can be conducted consistent with its mandate.  As I said, it will carry out public consultations and report on further legislative recommendations over its first four years in office.  These will be in areas such as removing the existing client money and direct access restrictions relating to barristers, examining entry and training requirements for the legal professions, the possible unification of the two legal professions and the opening of the legal services market to multi-disciplinary practices.  Senator Ardagh made comments about some of those issues.<\/p> <p>In support of the planned and managed commencement of the relevant Parts of the section of the 2015 Act proposed, as I have outlined, between now and the end this year, an allocation of &euro;1 million has been made available under the justice Vote for 2016 as set-up support for the new regulatory authority.  Any funding advance from this allocation will be provided on a recuperable basis.  Once in operation, the new regulatory regime will be self-funding by means of a levy on the regulated legal professions under the terms set out in Part 7 of the 2015 Act.  Again, I note what Senator Ardagh said on that matter about the costs on small businesses.<\/p> <p>As I said in my opening remarks, the T&aacute;naiste has now signed a commencement order in respect of certain provisions in Parts 1 and 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 as necessary to support the start of the new regulatory authority.  The T&aacute;naiste will also very soon by order appoint 1 October 2016 to be the establishment day for the new legal services regulatory authority.<\/p> <p>Senators' consideration of this motion has been a third key in the opening up of a new era in the regulation of legal services and of legal costs in the State. I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and Members for your time, support and consideration of these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#HH00600","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1468920600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I propose that we suspend for ten minutes to give the Minister of State a quick break.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#JJ00100","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It gives me an opportunity to describe the service provided by CEPOL and highlight the benefit it brings to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>As Senators are aware, CEPOL is the European police college which was established in 2005.  It brings together senior police officers from across the European Union and aims to encourage cross-border co-operation in the fight against crime and the maintenance of public security and law and order through training and exchange programmes and the sharing of research and best practice.<\/p> <p>Since 2005, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has played an important part in CEPOL EU training by organising courses at the Garda College for participants from EU member states to attend.  These include training programmes on language development, human rights, community policing, confiscation of assets and counterfeit medicines.  The expertise of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has proven beneficial to CEPOL through their involvement in training programmes in other member states on a wide variety of policing topics, including issues relating to management, public order and crowd management, Schengen, counterfeit goods, organised crime and drugs.  In more recent times, CEPOL has provided training programmes to address emerging policing and security issues such as fundamentalism and immigration.<\/p> <p>As a result, CEPOL has been successful in terms of developing the talents of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its ability to network and co-operate with other European counterparts.  As we can see from the almost daily terrorist attacks which have begun to define the world we live in, terrorism and organised crime are emerging and constantly changing form and means.  The sharing of good practice, prevention techniques and the use of modern tools to address these threats are vital in our efforts to protect citizens and combat crime.<\/p> <p>The new regulation, which replaced the 2005 Council decision, was introduced to enhance CEPOL's operational mandate and reform its governance in line with general principles laid down in the Lisbon treaty.  The general aim of the regulation is to improve EU security through the implementation by CEPOL of a new training approach for EU law enforcement officers consistent with evolving priorities for operational law enforcement co-operation.  Moreover, the regulation has widened the target group of law enforcement officials that CEPOL should serve as well as expanding its research function and association with relevant bodies.  The regulation was drafted on the basis of the EU Commission's communication on the law enforcement training scheme, LETS.  LETS aims to make the EU's response to common security challenges more effective, to raise the standard of policing across the EU and to stimulate the development of a common law enforcement culture as a means of enhancing mutual trust and co-operation.  In this regard, the regulation identifies and addresses gaps in existing law enforcement training on cross-border matters by supporting and, where appropriate, co-ordinating the delivery of training by European and national centres of excellence.  The regulation provides CEPOL with the appropriate legal mandate and necessary resources to implement the training effort envisaged in the communication.<\/p> <p>In addition, the scope of CEPOL's mandate is broadened so that it can support, develop, deliver and co-ordinate learning activities for law enforcement officials of all ranks, and not only police officers of senior rank as was the case under the old CEPOL decision, as well as to officers of customs and other relevant services dealing with cross-border issues.  This means if we opt in our customs officials will also be able to benefit from the training provided.<\/p> <p>Perhaps equally as valuable, the regulation ensures that the agency remains network-based, bringing together the network of training institutes of the member states for law enforcement officials and liaising with a single national unit in each member state.  This, as I am sure Senators will appreciate, will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to continue to build networks of counterparts in other EU jurisdictions which can be used for other operational intelligence sharing outside of the CEPOL framework.  Furthermore, the core objectives of CEPOL were updated and clarified so the agency may improve awareness and knowledge of international and European Union instruments, the institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union.  It will now also encourage the development of regional or bilateral co-operation among member states and address specific criminal or policing thematic areas where training at EU level can add value in addition to the national level.<\/p> <p>The regulation expands and provides clarity on the role of CEPOL and improves governance in the management, accountability and procedures for the CEPOL secretariat and the member states involved in police training.  For all these reasons, I hope Senators can agree that Ireland's implementation of the regulation will be of tremendous value to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our customs service.  It will also send a clear message that Ireland continues to support CEPOL and values the service it provides.  The regulation came into effect on 1 July 2016 and Ireland is now no longer involved in the college because we have yet to signal our desire to participate.<\/p> <p>Senators will be mindful of the importance of training for our law enforcement agencies.  The Garda Inspectorate, in its report of 2007 on the future of policing in Ireland, indicated that historically police services have dedicated substantial resources to recruit training but did not invest appropriately in the long-term professional development of personnel.  The recently published Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na modernisation and renewal programme for the period 2016 to 2021 identifies training and development as a key requirement in developing a modern, efficient police service.  It stresses that training is critical to the success of the modernisation programme.  CEPOL can continue to provide a valuable service in this regard.<\/p> <p>I strongly believe that continued participation in CEPOL will be of huge benefit to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the customs service at no cost to the Irish Exchequer.  For all of these reasons I invite Senators to support the motion before them, which will allow Ireland to opt in to the new CEPOL regulation.  By doing so, we will allow our police force to continue to benefit from the invaluable training provided by CEPOL and to learn from and engage with other European partners to assist in the fight against crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#KK00400","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House and thank him for his contribution.  CEPOL is an EU agency dedicated to providing training and learning opportunities to law enforcement officers on issues vital to the security of the European Union.  Its main activities are providing education courses and organising seminars and conferences in this regard.  From speaking to a senior member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na last night, I know the organisation is a very active contributor to the agency and is keen to continue to benefit from participation of CEPOL as a full member.  I understand that on this occasion it will have representation on the agency's management board.  It is very keen to ensure continued participation as a full member because it has benefitted greatly from it since its inception in 2005.  In accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of Protocol No. 21 to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Ireland needs to notify the Council and Commission that it wishes to accept the measures as described in the regulation.

I do not need to reiterate, because the Minister of State knows better than most, the scope of the crime and criminality we deal with in an increasingly globalised world.  Anything that seeks to enhance, refine, professionalise and improve our policing services throughout the EU is to be welcomed.  From our perspective, it is well known that Sinn F&eacute;in has its criticisms of the EU and subversion of sovereignty, but co-operation is welcome and, I would contest, necessary in this regard to counter some of what we have seen manifesting on the streets of this city.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We discussed it at length during the Minister of State's previous appearances before us.

That is the key component in this issue.<\/p><p>As I listened to the Minister of State and read over my notes, I wondered whether any thought had been given to the impact of Brexit on co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI?  We are in uncharted waters and I do not mean to veer off from the content of this motion, but this matter is critical.  We know that cross-Border co-operation works particularly well when dealing with issues of human and drug trafficking.  Many issues may arise for us as the Brexit decision across the water takes shape and begins to be implemented.  To be valid, EU harmonisation or co-operation measures on justice or training for those engaged in the administration of justice should have as their objective the increased protection of human rights.  Does the Minister of State believe that this is the case in this instance?  I ask this question in light of the reasons that I have outlined previously.  I do not need to rehearse them.<\/p><p>Within a human rights-based framework, Sinn F&eacute;in supports international co-operation on justice matters where it is necessary to fight crime, in particular child protection concerns and the cross-border trafficking of drugs, weapons and humans.  I support this endeavour and I hope that we as legislators, including the Government, will continue to have oversight on broader policing matters and final decisions and will not concede any ground to unelected officials or quangos at EU level.<\/p><p>I appreciate that I may be catching the Minister of State unaware, but perhaps he will make reference to the issue of Brexit and express how he believes it will impact on participation in CEPOL.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#KK00600","speaker":"1413","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House on this issue.

The Minister of State outlined its import.  Sadly, almost daily terrorist attacks are beginning to define the world.  The atrocity in Nice was mentioned on the Order of Business.  I condemn the perpetrator of those awful killings and express my sympathy to the victims who remain in hospital and to the families of the deceased, some of whom were children.  It was an appalling attack.<\/p> <p>In times of such atrocities, it is important that we be able to see the co-ordination across Europe of good policing networks, policing that can respond to a transnational terrorism threat and security and crime concerns in compliance with fundamental human rights and civil liberties.  It is important that the key principles underpinning the European agenda on security include that compliance.  For example, it is right to condemn the attempted coup in Turkey, but also the disproportionate response of the Erdogan Government.  Many of us would be concerned by the calls by members of the Turkish Government to bring back the death penalty.  It would be at odds with the European agenda on security, the European conception of fundamental rights and membership of the Council of Europe and the EU, which requires the abolition of the death penalty.  Compliance with fundamental rights, transparency, accountability and democratic control of policing are important, as they give citizens confidence in policing and law enforcement generally.  This is an important framework within which to consider the CEPOL regulation.<\/p> <p>In recent months, there have been significant concerns in the US about how its policing operates, perceptions around racial bias and so on.  That situation underlines the importance of having proper governance of and accountability for policing.  I am glad that we have a policing authority in this jurisdiction.  Long overdue, it was a missing element of the major reforms of 2005.<\/p> <p>For all of the reasons that I have cited, I support this measure.  It underlines the benefits of training and development, which were identified in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 as key requirements for developing a modern and efficient police service.  As the former Chairman of the justice committee, the Minister of State will recall our hearings with the Garda Inspectorate regarding its reporting on flaws and inadequacies in policing, many of which stemmed from poor training practices, little oversight of newly recruited garda&iacute;, etc.  We are all aware of the importance of training and development.<\/p> <p>I have a question about something that the Minister of State said.  As the regulation entered into force on 1 July, Ireland is no longer involved in the college because we have yet to signal our desire to participate.  We are coming to the table late with this motion, given that today is 19 July.  The measure has been lapsed for the past two weeks.  Will the Minister of State clarify the situation?  If the motion is passed by both Houses, we will be back in the college, so to speak, and can continue our co-operation.  I believe that the Minister of State is confirming that.  I just wanted to check.  I remember from the justice committee the imperative of agreeing EU motions before particular deadlines.  Why have we come late to this one, given its importance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#LL01000","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Before calling Senator Conway, I welcome a group of sisters to the Visitors Gallery.

As we know, crime no longer has borders.  With the development of technology and elaborate webs of communication, criminals now operate in multiple jurisdictions across the world.  I welcome the motion.  It is appropriate that we participate in this process.  That there has been a lapse is a pity but, to be fair, we are still in the early stages of a new Government that took a protracted period to be put together.  I do not doubt that, once we re-engage with the process, we will do so fully and bring the Garda's wonderful skills to the fore, particularly in mediation, diplomacy and so forth.  Our specialist garda&iacute; will benefit significantly from the exchange of knowledge and the development of an international skill base that will equip them in what is a new world order.  Consider what we have seen in the past week alone in terms of terrorist attacks.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is an absolute need for as many resources as possible to be provided for CEPOL which has to work.  International knowledge needs to be developed to deal with and profile crime and the people involved in it.  I have no doubt that this approach will be a success, but it will not succeed without the active engagement of all countries and policing authorities.  Equally, it will not succeed unless the proper financial resources are made available.<\/p><p>I am delighted that the Garda College in Templemore reopened approximately three years ago.  I would like to think it will never close again.  Similarly, I hope our involvement in CEPOL will never cease.  I suggest not only that we become active participants in all of its programmes, but also that we become leaders.  We have the capability and the human resources within the structures of the police force to ensure tis can happen.  Given that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is primarily unarmed, it has achieved remarkable success.  We all like to see crime figures going down.  We all regret it when they are going up.  When one examines the figures in an international context, however, it is clear that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as a primarily unarmed security force, does a wonderful job.<\/p><p>I would like the Minister of State to comment on British involvement in CEPOL in the light of the new narrative emerging in Britain's relationship with the European Union.  How does this new dynamic affect CEPOL?  It is extremely important, particularly from an Irish perspective, for England to have an absolute unity of purpose, engagement and involvement in this project.  I would be worried if it were to be affected in any way by the upcoming Brexit negotiations.  I am not sure of the extent to which Britain is involved in CEPOL.  Perhaps the Minister of State might enlighten me in that regard.<\/p><p>Education and upskilling happen in many sectors.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have been in the force for a number of years should have an opportunity to benefit from upskilling opportunities.  I encourage the Garda Commissioner to look at increasing the number of upskilling programmes.  We all know from the justice committee and other forums that the Garda's ICT facilities are not fit for purpose.  The Minister of State might tell us at some stage how the roll-out of the advanced ICT programme within the Garda - I cannot remember its name - is progressing.  I would not expect him to have that information to hand.  While the PULSE system was absolutely groundbreaking at the time of its inception, it is probably not fit for purpose now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#LL01200","speaker":"1416","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>As Leader of the House, I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of Sr. Maureen.  I congratulate her on being 100 years young and wish her a happy and enjoyable day.<\/p> <p>It is a tough task to follow Senator Martin Conway because everything he said was apt and important.  I am thinking particularly of what he said about the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore, the best way to learn from the Garda's participation in activities of this nature and the efforts to improve the skill set of the valued members of our important police force.  There is no doubt that we are living in turbulent times.  I refer, for example, to the fallout from the Brexit vote, the attacks in Baghdad, the attack on the airport in Istanbul, the shootings of police officers in America, the prevalence of gun crime and the attack in Nice.  The world and the European Union should be craving peace and security.  Instead, we face huge challenges as we strive to protect and preserve law and order.  When I was a student at Maynooth college, Professor Ronan Drury used to say, \"The world is not half settled\".  That comes to mind today.  In this world, when we should be talking about solidarity and security, we are under threat.<\/p> <p>The motion before the House gives us an important opportunity to build and develop co-operation across Europe with our law enforcement officials.  I want to look at what we are trying to achieve.  We are trying to eradicate conflict at a time when the threat of conventional and unconventional terrorism seems to be growing.  That is why the motion is so important.  On a daily basis we hear stories of ordinary people being killed or injured by supposedly ordinary people who do not have links with any terrorist organisation but which have resources that would put some of the other armed leaders in the world to shame.  We must move the world in which we live and co-exist towards one in which security is built and - this is the key phrase - co-operation developed.<\/p> <p>I would like to refer to what is at the fundamental heart of CEPOL.  It is about encouraging cross-border co-operation, fighting crime, protecting and providing security, enhancing the public security of all citizens across the European union, facilitating intercountry co-operation and, as Senator Martin Conway rightly said, sharing ideas and research.  In this new modern world it is critical that we consider how best to engage with and help our law enforcement officials to train and be a pillar and bastion of security.  It is worth mentioning another important point in this context.  The motion is not just about law enforcement officials; it is also about extending these structures of co-operation, training and development to Customs officials.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach and I live in coastal areas.  County Cork is on the coast.  While the threat of terrorism in our localities may be limited, there is a need for Customs officials to develop links with law enforcement officials and work in tandem with them.  For that reason, I am glad that the motion mentions Customs officials.<\/p> <p>I was struck by Senator Martin Conway's remarks about specialist garda&iacute; who have demonstrably brought a significant amount of knowledge and information to bear across the world and who would benefit from training and development.  Senator Ivana Bacik mentioned the fundamental principles of human rights that relate to law and order and decency.  One cannot have a state stating it intends to impose the death penalty on citizens who were involved in a coup, regardless of how right or wrong it was.  We all accept that the coup in question was not right.  We are trying to build an emerging consensus for co-operation across Europe in how we handle law and order and security issues.<\/p> <p>I welcome the motion.  It is important that we equip the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have shown across the world that they, as Irish people, are able to perform in and bring life to many difficult situations.  I thank the Minister of State for bringing the motion before the House.  It is important that we allow for this type of activity which enables garda&iacute; to learn from their counterparts in other states as part of their training in the Garda College in Templemore.  I am glad that this is going to be done.  Equally, I am glad that my party reopened the college.  As Senator Martin Conway said, it is to be hoped we never see it closed again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#MM00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their considered views, support for the motion and questions on the issues raised.  <\/p> <p>Senator Diarmuid Wilson was very supportive of the motion and CEPOL, for which I thank him.  <\/p> <p>Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile raised a number of issues, including Brexit, which was also mentioned by Senator Martin Conway and others.

As is known, it is very good at present.  The Senator mentioned important issues such as human trafficking, drugs and so forth.  Other Senators, including Senator Martin Conway, mentioned the fact that crime did not respect borders.  It is important, therefore, that we have co-operation.<br\/><br\/>I emphasise that CEPOL is not a harmonisation instrument.  There will be no sharing of operational information.  There is no transfer of sovereignty or powers in any way.  It relates to training and learning opportunities in order that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can benefit and learn from the expertise of police services in other jurisdictions and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  We also have information to impart.  We have a very good police service which is improving all the time.  As mentioned by Senator Ivana Bacik and others, there is a great deal of oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the newly established Policing Authority, the Garda Inspectorate, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and the excellent justice committee that is being formed.  In addition to this oversight, there is a lot of support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br\/><br\/>I join Senator Ivana Bacik in referring to the tragedy that took place in Nice and conveying our sympathy to the people who have been bereaved, as well as to those who suffered and are still suffering.  As Senator Martin Conway said, the nature of these activities is changing all the time and police services across Europe must keep up to date with what might happen.<br\/><br\/>Senator Martin Conway referred to the ICT programme.  Additional funding has been provided by the Government and the programme is being rolled out.  It is referenced in the modernisation and renewal programme of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, on which we will be happy to provide further information for the Senator, if required.<br\/><br\/>Senator Ivana Bacik mentioned the delay.  Obviously, many things were delayed until the Government was formed.  Many issues could not be progressed.  We are now progressing this matter with the support of Senators and will progress it further in the future.<br\/><br\/>Senators Ivana Bacik and Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile mentioned human rights.  Both Senators were right to stress their importance.  In the past few weeks I attended the Fundamental Rights Forum held by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights in Vienna on Europe and empowering rights.  I also addressed the United Nations General Assembly in New York last week on human rights.  We are very conscious of the need to keep this issue at the forefront.  I thank both Senators for their comments on this important topic and invite them to continue mentioning it.  We must maintain the importance of human rights, continue to develop our understanding of them and learn what they mean when we talk about them.<br\/><br\/>The European police college was established in September 2005 and is dedicated to providing training and learning opportunities for law enforcement officers on issues vital to the security of the European Union.  It is a cost-effective means of upskilling members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Customs officials in critical policing areas in times of restricted budgets.  It provides a diversity of training courses in areas where there might not be a national skills base such as dismantling illicit laboratories, fundamentalism and so forth.  It provides a European and international context for the understanding and learning of new crime trends, which are key in an increasingly transnational crime environment.  The training courses involve participants from many European jurisdictions which provides opportunities to network and build professional contacts which are invaluable as member states operate in an increasingly transnational context.  They also provide opportunities to examine best practice in other European jurisdictions, thus providing a useful resource in policy development at home.<br\/><br\/>I invite Senators to support the motion in order that we can continue this excellent work at European level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071900002#MM00300","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468920600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I join the Cathaoirleach and other Senators in welcoming Sr. Maureen and her colleagues.
