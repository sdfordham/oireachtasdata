Accordingly, it was necessary to adjust the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme. However, rather than simply apply an across the board cut to the rates payable or reduce the maximum payable area, I decided that real efforts should be made to focus the Scheme on those farmers who are most actively contributing to achieving the aims of the Scheme, namely: ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of viable rural communities; maintaining the countryside; and maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which take account of environmental protection measures.<\/p><p>  I was also determined that those adversely affected by the 2012 changes should be afforded the opportunity to appeal, where they could show legitimate reasons for their inability to meet the new requirements. In total, my Department wrote to in excess of 10,000 beneficiaries under the 2011 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme whose holdings had not achieved the minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare, as required under the Terms and Conditions of the 2012 Scheme. <\/p><p>  Provision was made for an appeals process to take account of a variety of situations, specifically: Restriction on the stocking levels on the holding due to adherence to an agri-environments plan such as REPS, AEOS or National Parks and Wildlife Service plan; Farming marginal land where the level of stock that can be maintained is restricted; Illness or death in family; Outbreak of animal disease in the herd; New entrant to farming.<\/p><p>  In response, my Department received 9,635 applications from farmers seeking derogation from the requirement that the minimum stocking density on the holding should be 0.3 livestock units per hectare or higher in respect of 2011. <\/p><p>  These applications have been fully processed, with 7,086 being successful.

A total of &euro;10 million has been allocated for this programme in 2013, which is financed from unspent Single Farm Payment Funds.<\/p><p>  This programme will assist farmers in improving the genetic quality of Irish cattle and will maintain the data flow into ICBF in order to build further knowledge and more rapid progress in breeding and ultimately in profitability for farmers.  In terms of support for the beef sector, I also announced that the Beef Technology Adoption Programme would be retained for 2013.  This Programme, which provides for funding of &euro;5m this year, will continue to provide farmers with better information to increase profitability on farms.<\/p><p>  In excess of &euro;150 million has been paid to participants in the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme since its inception.

Of these, the Breeding sector comprised 73,349, the competition sector 10,354 and the leisure sector 35,882.  These figures were compiled using a number of sources, such as Central Statistics Office data, the records of approved horse registration organisations and surveys of a wide range of parties in the industry itself.<\/p><p>  With regard to animal health issues, the movement of equidae between Member States of the EU is subject to harmonised rules governing animal health. These rules require all equidae to be accompanied by a passport and a health document stating that the equidae has come from a holding which is not restricted due to notifiable diseases of equidae and are clinically healthy at the time of examination. The rules also provide that the equidae must undergo a veterinary inspection 48 hours prior to movement and their movement must be recorded on the TRACES system.<\/p><p>  A Tripartite Agreement (TPA) between the United Kingdom, France and Ireland avails of a derogation provided for in Article 6 of Council Directive 2009\/156\/EC.  This allows Member States to grant one another derogations from requirements for inspection and certification prior to movement and trade between them, provided they are satisfied that the relevant health status between the signatory countries is equivalent. Each country is required to notify the other members of the Tripartite of any confirmed cases of listed diseases that change the equivalence status. The original TPA related exclusively to horses registered in stud books or registered to any international association or organisation which manages horses for competition or racing. However, with the advent of compulsory identification of equidae and the requirement for all equidae to have passports, all equidae with passports (except those destined directly for slaughter) are permitted to move freely within the TPA areas.<\/p><p>  With regard to human health, under EU and national regulation, only those horses that have been identified and registered with a passport issuing organisation may be considered for slaughter for human consumption.  Horses treated with certain veterinary medicines such as phenylbutazone are permanently excluded from the human food chain in order to protect public health and the passport of the horse in question is endorsed by the prescribing veterinary practitioner to this effect at the time of the prescription being issued or the medicine being administered.

These principles are that:<\/p><p> -  The CAP 2014-2020 must overall be simpler and cheaper for national authorities to administer, and have reduced administrative costs for recipients. Any increased cost or complexity to specific measures can only be justified where the benefits outweigh the costs,<\/p><p> -  A risk-based approach should be applied to all controls on both administrations and recipients. This means that controls are reduced where the administration has demonstrated that they have a robust system of controls in place, or the recipient has a good track record. Equally, controls should - as is already the case - be increased where systemic problems have occurred,<\/p><p> -  Member States should be given the discretion and flexibility in programming and to define the detailed control, monitoring and evaluation of schemes in a manner appropriate to their particular circumstances, providing they can demonstrate that the policy measures taken are effective,<\/p><p> -  Greater proportionality should be applied to controls and penalties,<\/p><p> -  Full transparency and clarity of all roles and responsibilities should be provided, and mechanisms put in place for providing the necessary clarity if there is any uncertainty about the interpretation of EU requirements,<\/p><p> -  The use of technology should be maximise and incentivised.<\/p><p>  Last year, we submitted a detailed paper to the Commission containing our proposals for simplification. The paper divided our concerns between policy and technical dimensions. The technical dimensions related to detailed article-by-article provisions of the draft CAP reform regulations.  On policy, we stated our view that the formulation of policy in an overall sense should be informed by the need to keep things as simple as possible, and we highlighted some key concerns in this regard, namely:<\/p><p> -  on direct payments, the fact that the proposals for a new payment model, the definition of &lsquo;active farmer&rsquo; and a separate scheme for the &lsquo;greening&rsquo; of direct payments would all add considerably to the administrative burden for Member States,<\/p><p> -  on rural development, the fact that a complex framework to ensure coherence between spending from all EU funds, new ex-ante and macroeconomic conditionalities, and a new performance reserve would, similarly, add to Member States&rsquo; administrative burden,<\/p><p> -  on financing and monitoring of the CAP, that there should be greater simplification of cross-compliance measures, the accreditation of payment agencies and the requirements for certifying bodies,<\/p><p> -  that the general simplification of the regulatory framework, which is best exemplified in the single CMO proposals, should also result in practical benefits at farmer and administrative levels across all elements of the reform.<\/p><p>  Many of our concerns have been taken on board in the subsequent negotiations, which, of course, are still ongoing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200053#WRB06400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[6965\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200053#WRB06600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"in the event of a new reference year being decided as part of the common agriculture policy reform negotiations, if the lessor or the lessee will be entitled to the single payment entitlements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":79,"content":"<p>The European Commission&rsquo;s proposals for the reform of the CAP post-2013 included a proposal to use 2014 as a reference year for establishing entitlements to future direct payments.

I am very pleased that we have managed to protect Irish farmers&rsquo; direct payments, given that there were substantial threats to this vital transfer to Ireland from those who wished to cut the CAP budget overall by a much larger amount and from the redistribution of these funds between member states.  <\/p><p>  On Rural Development, overall EU funding has been reduced from the previous financial period, and there has been some redistribution between Member States. However, we managed to negotiate a special additional allocation of &euro;100 million for Ireland in the final stages of the talks.  <\/p><p>  The challenge for us now is to ensure that this money, which will be matched with Irish exchequer funding, is used as effectively as possible to support the aims and targets we have set ourselves in Food Harvest 2020. The agri-food sector has tremendous potential for further sustainable growth and we must use these funds to maximise that potential and deliver the jobs dividend that will come from it.<\/p><p>  The policy paper produced by the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association relates more particularly to the reform of the CAP for the period post-2013. As President of the European Council of Agriculture Ministers, my objective is to negotiate a Council position on the reform package by the end of March, with a view to securing an inter-institutional political agreement with the European Parliament and the Commission by the end of June. Bearing this in mind, the position is broadly as follows:<\/p><p>  Two of the most difficult issues in the negotiations arise in relation to the administration of the single farm payment. These are internal convergence and greening. As regards internal convergence, the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to move to a system of flat-rate national or regional payments would, in the case of several Member States (including Ireland), result in significant transfers between farmers. These Member States are seeking a solution that will mitigate this impact and this is an issue on which Ireland too played a leading role. Other Member States - such as the newer Member States who already implement an area-based system - are seeking alternative solutions, while still others are happy with the flat rate system. I hope to be able to navigate a course through these diverging positions in the coming weeks and settle on a compromise acceptable to all Member States. <\/p><p>  As regards greening, most Member States (including Ireland), support further greening of the CAP, as it is consistent with the need to develop the agriculture sector in a sustainable manner. However, there are concerns about the separate and distinct nature of the greening payment, and the fact that it is to be paid on a flat-rate basis. Member States also have issues with the three greening criteria (crop diversification, maintenance of permanent grassland and ecological focus areas) and favour flexibility to implement these in a simpler manner that is also more relevant to local conditions. Again, I hope to bring forward proposals on these issues in the coming weeks that will strike a balance between the different approaches favoured by Member States.<\/p><p>  On the other direct payments issues raised by the Deputy, the main point outstanding, according to the Cyprus Presidency&rsquo;s Progress Report, is the question of the young farmers&rsquo; scheme, and whether it will be voluntary or mandatory for Member States. I have stated my preference for a mandatory scheme, but I recognise that a majority of Member States favours a voluntary approach. <\/p><p>  On rural development, apart from the question of funding, the main issues in the context of the CAP reform package are the effect of the greening of direct payments on the baseline for rural development payments, the delimitation of areas with natural constraints and the structure of risk management and income stabilisation tools. In addition, the Commission is pressing for greater coherence between the different EU funds and to ensure that all objectives are consistent with EU 2020 strategy priorities, which raises administrative difficulties for Member States. Some of these issues will again prove difficult to resolve, but I hope to make rapid progress over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  As regards the common organisation of the market, I agree that adequate funding is an important prerequisite for the effective functioning of the various elements of the safety net mechanism. Particularly difficult issues in this dossier will be control measures in the form of sugar quotas and vine planting rights. Member States are divided on the question of whether sugar quotas should be abolished or extended, although the European Parliament generally favours extension. On vine planting rights, the report of the High Level Group will inform the next phase of the discussions, but again the question will be whether to extend the regime or allow the planned expiry in 2015 to proceed. Compensation for reduced milk supply, as proposed by the European Parliament, will also be a difficult issue as it too touches on the organisation of the market, on which there are contrasting views. On producer organisations, some progress has been achieved, with the Special Agriculture Committee last week reaching agreement on the issue of recognition. On exceptional measures and the crisis reserve, the key requirement is that funding is available to deal with whatever emergency situations might arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200054#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy Negotiations","counter":87,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200054#WRC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[6980\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200054#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the stance being adopted by him in relation to greening in the common agricultural policy negotiations; if he supports the EU Commission's position that greening payments should be paid at a flat rate rather than on a farm by farm calculation; if he is still pursuing his variable greening proposal, the implications of this proposal on farmers in designated areas with strict stocking limits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":89,"content":"<p>I support the idea of encouraging sustainable forms of agriculture, which is at the heart of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy, and I can support the Commission in its desire to further enhance the green credentials of direct payments.

This announcement was made against the background of ambitious plans under the Food Harvest 2020 Report to increase dairy production by 50% in the period to 2020, and the realisation that such additional production would need to find a home on international markets. <\/p><p>  Environmental sustainability is an increasingly important issue in the market place for multi-national dairy and food operators, many of which now have sustainability as a core part of their corporate strategies.  Ireland is well placed to develop a national brand image based on its mild maritime climate, plentiful supplies of water, grass based production, and an already positive green image.  <\/p><p>  Last year Bord Bia launched its &ldquo;Origin Green&rdquo; programme which establishes a framework within which Irish food companies can have their green credentials independently measured, and this will be a critically important element in the development of the Irish food sector in the coming years and its promotion on international markets.  Indeed it has become clear during my trade missions to China and the US in 2012 that the sustainability message has a strong resonance both with potential customers for Irish food products and with potential investors in the Irish agri food sector.  The key is to build independently verifiable metrics, which can be used in the marketplace, around Ireland&rsquo;s already positive green image.   Developing an independently accredited sustainability and quality programme for the dairy sector is an important part of that overall strategy.  There is also a strong correlation between the measures needed to improve environmental sustainability, and those needed to reduce the costs of production at farm level and improve profitability.  <\/p><p>  In that context, and following extensive consultations with stakeholders in the first half of 2012, I announced last June that Bord Bia would begin detailed work on the development of a national sustainability programme for the dairy sector, which will be used as a key element in marketing and promotional efforts on international markets.  Stakeholders are currently engaged in detailed technical discussions on the development of the programme, under the aegis of a technical advisory group convened by Bord Bia to progress the issue.  It is essential, of course, that the technical elements of such a programme strike the correct balance and are both practical to implement and meaningful in content.  I am confident that this programme, which will in any event be finalised in full consultation with stakeholders, including farm bodies, will strike an appropriate balance, and that it will facilitate the expansion and development of the Irish dairy sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200054#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commonage Division","counter":99,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200054#WRC01450"},{"type":"question","counter":100,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[6988\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200054#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the progress made to date on proposals in relation to commonages; and if he will confirm that no decision will be made in relation to this matter until it has been examined by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":101,"content":"<p>The Commonage Framework Plans, first published in 2002, have been reviewed to take account of the current vegetative condition of commonages nationally.

The role of my Department is to verify compliance by the food business operators with this requirement. This is done by a combination of inspection of establishments and by audit on the food safety management systems which operators are required to have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b><\/b>It is important to point out that the key controls carried out by my Department, under its contract with the FSAI, relate to food safety. <\/p><p><br \/>  EU law provides for the free movement of goods between Member States. On that basis, meat and meat products produced in an establishment which is approved under the relevant EU regulation can be moved freely within the EU. As is the case with compliance with EU food safety regulations, responsibility for compliance with traceability requirements rests in the first instance with food business operators. Food business operators in Ireland are responsible for carrying out checks to ensure that their ingredients come from EU approved plants. They must also have a system in place to identify the source of inputs and destination of outputs (referred to as one &#8220;step forward and one step back&#8221;). <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants. Controls at stand alone secondary processing plants are carried out at a frequency which is based on an annual risk assessment for each plant. Checks are also conducted at retail level by the HSE, working under the aegis of the FSAI which has an overarching supervisory role in relation to labelling matters.  <\/p><p><br \/>  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. In addition, labelling and documentary checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. <\/p><p><br \/>  Under the Department&#8217;s National Residue Programme, and including tests on bovine samples carried out by processors, up to 30,000 samples taken at farm and factory level and covering a wide range of food stuffs are tested annually. These tests relate to microbiological and chemical standards, their primary focus being on food safety. These are fully in accordance with EU testing requirements.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition the Product Official Sampling and Testing (POST) programme is a microbiological testing programme on samples taken from Department approved ready-to-eat food, meat product, minced meat and meat preparation plants i.e. added value plants. This is part of the official verification of food safety controls in the plants concerned as provided for in Regulations (EC) 852\/2004, 854\/2004 and 2073\/2005. A total of 1,600 samples are taken annually and the sampling and testing is risk based.<\/p><p><br \/>  The focus of the Department and FSAI efforts in relation to current investigations has been on identifying the source of equine DNA in beef burgers, and ensuring that the corrective action necessary to prevent a recurrence is taken. DNA testing is not required under EU legislation and is not generally in use in relation to food production. It has however been deployed in recent times as part of the FSAI&#8217;s checks on food authenticity and food fraud control programmes. In that respect it is another new layer to our food production controls. <\/p><p><br \/>  In the light of recent developments I have decided to request Irish manufacturers of processed meat products to carry out DNA testing and to work with the FSAI in developing testing protocols. I consider this a necessary step in order to provide further reassurance to Irish consumers and consumers of Irish food abroad about the authenticity of ingredients in our meat based products. Having regard to the close trading relationship between the Irish and UK food industries it is intended that the FSAI and the UK Food Standards Agency will work closely together and jointly agree an approach in this matter.   <\/p><p><br \/>  It is worth noting that it was because of the vigilance of our testing and control regime in Ireland that what is now a pan European problem, involving a range of meat products and traders\/food business operators, was exposed. In that context I am raising the issue at EU level to consider the wider implications and whatever steps may be necessary at that level to comprehensively address this matter. That does not lessen the determination of my Department and FSAI to continue to work with the Gardai to bring the enquiries here to a conclusion. I will continue to take whatever actions are necessary to ensure this issue is addressed in a comprehensive and effective manner. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200054#WRC01737","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sale of State Assets","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200054#WRC01740"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[5407\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200054#WRC01743","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the measures being taken to ensure the continued open access for recreation to land owned by Coillte in the context of the sale of parts of Coillte to private interests; if he plans to write into any sale agreement that there must be access to Coillte owned land for recreational users after the sale takes place, that car parks must be kept open, and that any damage to paths by machinery is repaired; and his view on the importance of land access to Coillte lands for recreational users","asker":"1011","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":108,"content":"<p>With reference to the Government decision, in the context of the asset disposal programme, that a concession for the harvesting rights to Coillte&rsquo;s forests be put forward for sale, substantial work has been undertaken to date on the identification of the forestry assets involved, the determination of their value and the consideration of a number of issues associated with the proposed sale of the harvesting rights.

I have been working to encourage more new entrants to take up farming as a career.  Budget 2013 saw the extension of key reliefs that were already in place for young new entrants (such as the 100% relief from Stamp Duty and the 100% stock relief for Young Trained Farmers).  Extending these reliefs is not straightforward given that there is a requirement for EU State Aid approval for such measures.  The deputy will also be aware that changes were made to retirement relief in budget 2012 to encourage inter-generational land transfers.  <\/p><p><br \/>  I am delighted that the number of applicants for Teagasc courses has greatly increased in the last two years.  Teagasc has responded well to this demand and has introduced new courses to cater for a variety of needs.  For example, Teagasc has recently launched a new Professional Diploma in Dairy Farm Management (Level 7) in association with University College Dublin (UCD). Teagasc has also developed recently a new Level 6 Specific Purpose Certificate in Farm Administration course to help meet the training requirements for full-time or part-time farmers. <\/p><p><br \/>  Measures to provide targeted support to young farmers are part of the current negotiations on the reform of the CAP and will I hope form part of any final agreement.  I have strongly supported the proposal for a top-up for young farmers under pillar 1 of the CAP, and indeed Ireland was one of the first countries to suggest this measure in the negotiations.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am also happy that the new restructuring relief has been announced in the 2013 budget.  This is the result of detailed work which analysed the reasons why the old consolidation relief was not working.  I am confident that the new relief in relation to Capital Gains Taxes, once State Aid approval has been received, will be more effective, especially given that Stamp Duty rates have been reduced.  Restructuring is essential for us to meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  We need to use land more productively and encourage more young farmers to make the best use of the land.  A recent EU Commission study found that <i>'younger [farm] managers tend to perform better than the EU average, with 46% more area and 57% more economic potential for 21% more labour force'<\/i><sup> [[1]<\/sup>  Commission Staff Working Paper, Impact Assessment, CAP towards 2020, <i>Annex 1: Situation and prospects for EU agriculture and rural areas<\/i>, p. 25. Brussels, 12\/10\/2011.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland has a very low level of land sales, with most land staying within the same family for generations.  Only 0.4% of land changes hand in any given year.  Young farmers that want to expand need to be able to access land.  According to the latest census of agriculture the average farm has 3.8 land parcels.  This means that our farmers are wasting time and diesel driving between plots of land, increasing the stress and the risk of accidents.  Young farmers will now have an opportunity to consolidate their holdings and increase efficiency.  <\/p><p><br \/>  I am hopeful therefore that the measures that I have introduced will encourage more young people into farming and address the age profile imbalance in Irish farming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200055#WRD00600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Sector","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200055#WRD00650"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[6956\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200055#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the way he can tally the objective of achieving the 30% EU forestry target and realising the known potential for employment in forestry and forestry related industry with his plans to sell off Coillte harvesting rights; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1094","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":163,"content":"<p>I wish to stress that it is a concession for the harvesting rights which is being considered for sale.

For example, last year funding was provided to emergencies including those in Mali, DRC, Syria, Niger, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen.<\/p><p>Recovery assistance is also provided to countries emerging from conflict or natural disaster through long term initiatives which help populations to re-establish their lives and livelihoods after an emergency.<\/p><p>The tables sets out, as requested, the humanitarian and recovery assistance provided by Ireland over the period 2011-2012:<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>Countries<\/div><\/th><th><div>Total 2011 &#8364;<\/div><\/th><th><div>Total 2012 &#8364;<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>Afghanistan<\/div><\/td><td><div>4,950,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>4,327,739<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Burma-Myanmar<\/div><\/td><td><div>200,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>800,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Cameroon<\/div><\/td><td><div>218,965<\/div><\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Central African Republic<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,500,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,450,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Chad<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,900,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,400,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Cote d&#8217;Ivoire<\/div><\/td><td><div>500,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Cuba<\/div><\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><td><div>150,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Democratic Republic of Congo<\/div><\/td><td><div>5,000,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>8,230,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>DPRK<\/div><\/td><td><div>250,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>200,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>El Salvador<\/div><\/td><td><div>250,000<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Ethiopia<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,075,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,275,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Gambia\/Guinea<\/div><\/td><td><div>249,950<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Haiti<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,750,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,050,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Horn of Africa<\/div><\/td><td><div>250,000<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Japan<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,000,000<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Jordan<\/div><\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><td><div>600,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Kenya<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,175,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>900,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Libya<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,100,000<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Mali<\/div><\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,067,220<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Mozambique<\/div><\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><td><div>100,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Niger<\/div><\/td><td><div>900,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,625,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Niger &amp;

Indeed data from the CSO&rsquo;s Residential Property Price Index show that national prices have been broadly stable for 9 months now, with prices in Dublin experiencing upward price pressure towards in the latter part of 2012. Indeed recent releases by both Daft.ie and myHome.ie have pointed to the same outcome. <\/p><p>  Whilst some commentators attributed some of the stabilisation to the ending of mortgage interest relief to new first-time buyers, it is not possible to separate out this effect from wider economic factors. Indeed, even if the ending of the relief did lead to an increase in transactions this may be because first-time buyers brought forward their planned purchases from 2013 to 2012 so as to benefit from mortgage interest relief. This may therefore have helped to stabilise property prices whilst the fundamentals of the economy improved. It is therefore hoped that stability will be maintained in 2013 and beyond with further improvements in economic fundamentals without the need for further measures.<\/p><p>  I would like to point out that there are a number of economic considerations that might mitigate against such a scheme going forward. <\/p><p>  Firstly, it is not clear that such a subsidy is necessary in the current environment. The price of housing is now at an affordable level for most individuals, with prices at a low level for housing suitable for first-time buyers. Providing a subsidy to mortgages would risk distorting a natural and sustainable growth in prices in the medium term. It would also need to be borne in mind, that a universal subsidy may not be the best way of making housing affordable to those who may have difficulties in securing mortgages as it also benefits those without difficulties. <\/p><p>  There is also the consideration that subsidies of this kind very often result in higher purchase prices and higher mortgages rather than more affordable housing and mortgages as the subsidy is generally passed through to the purchase price. To the extent that the mortgage interest subsidy results in higher prices and larger borrowings, I would be concerned that it would not in fact free up cash flow for the economy. <\/p><p>  Even if some of the subsidy does in fact result in greater disposable income, it is not clear that the income would be spent on additional consumption in the domestic economy. Given the high import propensity of a small open economy like Ireland, there is a risk that any additional expenditure would leak out of the economy. This of course assumes that individuals would actually spend any additional disposable income rather than saving or paying down extra capital on their mortgage. This would mean that the exchequer gains from the measure referred to by the Deputy may be overstated.<\/p><p>  In addition, you will also appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones.

However, in Finance Act 2010, mortgage interest relief was extended up to the end of 2017 for those whose entitlement to relief was due to end in 2010 or after (i.e. those who purchased in 2004 or after). <\/p><p><br \/>  Accordingly, individuals who took out qualifying loans in the period 2004 to 2012 will continue to be entitled to mortgage interest relief up until the end of 2017.   <\/p><p>It should be noted that, where there is an entitlement to mortgage interest relief, it is available at varying rates and subject to certain ceilings.  For example, individuals who are in the <i>first seven tax years of their qualifying loan<\/i> are entitled to a higher interest ceiling, on which the rate of relief is applied.  For such individuals, the interest ceilings are &#8364;10,000 per annum for a single individual and &#8364;20,000 per annum for married couples and civil partnerships. For individuals who have an entitlement to mortgage interest relief and who are in their <i>eighth or subsequent years of their qualifying loan<\/i>   a lower interest ceiling applies. For such individuals, the interest ceilings are &#8364;3,000 per annum for single and &#8364;6,000 per annum for married couples\/civil partnerships. Therefore, some individuals will experience a reduction in the level of relief they receive as they enter into their eighth and subsequent years of their qualifying loans.  However, they will continue to receive mortgage interest relief up until the end of 2017.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore, as you are aware, this Government is fully committed to helping address the particular problems faced by those that bought homes at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008.

In addition, where a building contractor carries out home improvements and the materials cost does not exceed two-thirds of the cost of the improvements then the reduced rate of 13.5% applies to the total building service.

In that regard, the housing policy statement, published in June 2011 by that Department, signalled a shift to a tenure neutral high level objective and a clear commitment to restoring balance to the housing sector generally through a lesser reliance on home ownership.  As such, Government will not act to prioritise one form of housing tenure over another.  Nevertheless, the policy statement reaffirms the State&#8217;s commitment to supporting access to home ownership for lower to middle income households and the current range of paths to home ownership that are facilitated by house purchase loans from local authorities will remain in place in that regard. I should also add that direct lending to Approved Housing Bodies in the voluntary and co-operative housing sectors is now in place through the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) which operates under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, and full details of the activities of the HFA can be found on the Agency&#8217;s website, <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i>  .   <\/p><p><br \/>  Regarding the provision of mortgage finance for home purchase more generally, this Government is pursuing a number of actions to ensure that an increased, but financially sustainable, level of mortgage credit will be available to new borrowers from commercial lenders to meet the needs of the economy and society.

The report notes that increasing the income thresholds will have an impact on the rate of property tax that will be applied.  As the income threshold increases the rate will also be required to increase to achieve the same revenue yields.<\/p><p>  The Thornhill Group, in its approach to exemptions, considered that the local property tax should be centred on the principles of equity, transparency and simplicity.  In terms of these principles, it was also considered that a universal liability should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.  The Group considered that waivers were an inefficient and costly method of targeting reliefs, whereas voluntary deferrals can be used to address cases where there is an inability to pay.<\/p><p>  The Government agreed with the Thornhill Group&rsquo;s recommendations that exemptions should be limited and voluntary deferrals were more appropriate for addressing issues of inability to pay.  Part 12 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 sets out provisions for deferral of the local property tax charge.  The deferral of the charge is granted under specific conditions.  Where the residential property is the sole or main residence of a liable person and her, his or their estimated gross income from all sources does not exceed &euro;15,000 for a single person or &euro;25,000 for a couple during the year covered by the return, she\/he\/they will be eligible to apply for full deferral of the LPT charge.  <\/p><p>  In addition, for income stressed owner-occupiers who have an outstanding mortgage, an adjusted gross income limit will apply.  In these cases, the income thresholds of &euro;15,000 or &euro;25,000 may be increased by 80% of the annual mortgage interest payments.  This type of deferral is available until the end of 2017.<\/p><p>  Moreover, owner-occupiers may be eligible to apply for partial deferral where the gross income from all sources is less than &euro;25,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple.  For income stressed owner-occupiers who have an outstanding mortgage, these thresholds may also be increased by 80% of the annual mortgage interest payments.  In these cases the owner-occupier will qualify for deferrals of 50% of the LPT liability and the balance of 50% of the tax must be paid.<\/p><p>  In recommending the income thresholds the Thornhill Group had regard to the analysis from the ESRI report.  An income level of &euro;25,000 for joint and co-owners\/spouses\/civil partners\/cohabitees was recommended in order to enable most households in the lowest 40% of income levels to have the option of deferral.

Under the Insurance Act 1964 the responsibility for deciding whether the ICF has sufficient funds available to it to at any particular time is a matter for the Central Bank.  Where in the Bank&rsquo;s opinion the state of the Fund is such that financial support should be provided for it, it determines an appropriate contribution to be paid to it by each insurer calculated as a percentage, not exceeding 2% of the aggregate of the gross premiums paid to that insurer in respect of policies issued in respect of risks in the State.  On the basis of its assessment of the Fund the Central Bank concluded that a levy should be applied to industry with effect from 1 January 2012 under section 6 of the Insurance Act 1964.<\/p><p>I estimate that in the region of &euro;337m will be paid into the ICF in 2013 made up of a total advance of &euro;272m from the Exchequer plus &euro;65m from the ICF levy.<\/p><p>At the end of December 2012 the total amount due from the ICF to the State was &euro;762m.

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.<\/p><p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.<\/p><p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the rights of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.<\/p><p>  Equality legislation, which also outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values.

It would not be appropriate to comment on possible future implementation arrangements whilst those discussions are ongoing. <\/p><p><br \/>  In regard to the verification of savings under the present agreement, I wish to make a number of points.  Firstly, the Implementation Body is required to assess the savings being facilitated under the framework of the Agreement on an annual basis.  As part of this annual review process, savings returns are completed and returned to the Body in respect of every sector, Department and Office.  These returns are required to be signed off by relevant accounting officers. <\/p><p><br \/>  Secondly, the Agreement allows for the engagement of external financial advisors to undertake independent verification of reported savings.  This involves a review of the methodology, quantification and estimation used by managements to identify savings that have been achieved and savings that will be achieved as a result of agreements reached and initiatives taken.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible, on time and cost grounds to externally evaluate every saving made under the Agreement.  Therefore, the approach the Body has taken has been to put forward a number of significant projects each year for external evaluation.  This verification process serves as a useful quality assurance check on what is being reported and public service management are aware that progress reported may be subject to such external evaluation.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Body has carried out two annual reviews to date.  Those reviews found that approximately &#8364;1.5 billion in savings has been achieved during the first two years of the Agreement, comprising of &#8364;810m and &#8364;678m in sustainable pay bill and non-pay (efficiency) savings respectively.<\/p><p><br \/>  Significantly, the external financial accountants engaged under both annual reviews found that, in all cases, the savings reported were reasonable estimates of the savings that have arisen or will arise due to the successful implementation of the projects concerned.  I understand that a similar verification exercise is being undertaken for the Body&#8217;s third annual review (currently underway).<\/p><p><br \/>  In regard to the question of private sector representation on the Implementation Body, it is important to point out that the Public Service Agreement is an agreement between the Government, as employer, and its employees, represented by the public service unions.  The Implementation Body is, accordingly, comprised of the representatives of the parties to the Agreement &#8211; this is provided for under its terms &#8211; and so the issue of private sector membership does not arise.  However, I understand that the Chair of the Body, who is independent, has briefed private sector interests on a number of occasions on behalf of the Body and is happy to continue to do so.  I am satisfied that the Body has approached its task in a thorough, transparent and objective manner, as evidenced by its two Annual Progress Reports published to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200061#WRK03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff","counter":559,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200061#WRK03050"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[6694\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200061#WRK03100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when he will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to amend the rules to ensure that no senior public servant, including political appointees or Minister can work in the private sector in any area involving a potential conflict of interest with their former area of public employment, until at least two years have elapsed after they have left the public service; if it is now his intention to limit this commitment to the General Scheme of a Regulation of Lobbying Bill provisions; and if so, the reason.","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":561,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my previous response on this issue in PQs No: 3710\/13 and No: 3711\/13 answered on Tuesday, 29th January, 2013 .<\/p><p>  Significant progress has been made in developing my proposals for the regulation of lobbying.

Since the system went live on 12<sup>th<\/sup> November demonstrations of the new system have been given to suppliers at Meet the Buyer events.  The National Procurement Service has also agreed with the Construction Industry Federation to give a seminar on the new system to them on a date to be agreed.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2012, there were 6,439 notices published on eTenders.  It is not possible to quantify how many of these tenders had more than one element. The National Procurement Service has begun the task of collating procurement statistics for the year 2012, in accordance with our EU obligations.  This statistical information should be available later in 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  During the week beginning 12th November, the first week the system went live; supplier and buyers received unsolicited marketing emails from the previous operator of the service, marketing a new service.  This email contained a username and password for their website, which caused widespread confusion among public sector Buyers and Suppliers as many of them thought these credentials were for the new eTenders system.<\/p><p><br \/>  Most of the complaints since the launch of the new site relate to the confusion caused by this email and the National Procurement Service communicated with registered Buyers and Suppliers to clarify the issue.<\/p><p><br \/>  While there were thousands of queries in relation to the new site and its functionality, the Helpdesk statistics for the first three months after its launch record only 22 complaints in relation to the new site, the majority of these in the first two weeks.  I received nine representations making complaints in relation to the new site.  The complaints relate to alerts to suppliers and the search function on the site, both of which have now been resolved; as well as the site design.  Since then the Helpdesk receives on average in the region of 250 routine calls per day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200061#WRK03900","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Regulations","counter":571,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200061#WRK03950"},{"type":"question","counter":572,"qnumday":317,"qnumall":"[6744\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200061#WRK04000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"in relation to the issue of underbidding on public procurement contracts, the measures he is taking to ensure that the Registered Employment Agreement is enforced; if the same enforcement procedures are being taken with regards to sub contractors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":573,"content":"<p>The public works contracts include a clause on pay and conditions of employment which require the main contractor to ensure that all those employed on the works (including those employed by sub-contractors) are paid in accordance with the Registered Employment Agreement (Construction Industry wages and conditions of employment).

In this regard, my colleague Minister of State Brian Hayes is working with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Senator&rsquo;s private member&rsquo;s Construction Contracts Bill into a robust piece of legislation. The Bill has passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>  The issue of whether the Bill should require all construction contracts to ensure that the payer is solvent (i.e. through the purchase of a financial product such as a bond) was examined during the consultation and Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) of the Bill. The RIA found that requiring payer to purchase bonds would reduce competition in the sector as such financial products are not widely available in the current market and the costs associated with purchasing them would be a barrier to entry for smaller contractors. Therefore the provisions necessary to provide security of payment would increase the regulatory burden and costs associated with contracts between clients, contractors, subcontractors and the final consumer. <\/p><p>  In addition, during the Second Stage reading of the Bill in the D&aacute;il, Minister Hayes made a number of points that address the issues raised by the Deputy:<\/p><p>  - In relation to payment difficulties that are linked to business failures, the Bill will not cut across the normal rules for company liquidation\/receivership or Prompt Payment regulations.  However, the Bill includes two key provisions that will reduce the exposure of subcontractors to non-payment in the event of a business failure.<\/p><p>  - Firstly, &ldquo;pay-when-paid&rdquo; clauses will no longer be permitted in construction contracts.  This means, for example, that sub-contractors or sub-sub-contractors will no longer be dependant on a main contractor getting paid before they are entitled to receive their own payments.<\/p><p>  - Secondly, all construction contracts will have to contain a payments schedule that clearly sets out both interim payments and final payments, and the sums due in each case.  The contract will have to set out clearly when payment of these amounts will fall due.  If a contract fails to specify these matters, then the terms set out in the Schedule to the Bill will apply. The Schedule sets out default arrangements for contract payment terms.  These will be minimum standards for sub-contracts.  This is a major innovation which should reduce the exposure of sub-contractors to non-payment.<\/p><p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal that the Bill should cover both public and private contracts, I assume the Deputy is referring to the issue of making adjudication awards binding for both the public and private sectors. This is a complex issue which makes it important to strike the right balance between giving this legislation the necessary enforcement provisions, whilst ensuring that the application of the legislation is equitable and the taxpayer is safeguarded.<\/p><p>  These and a number of other issues have been examined; Minister Hayes will shortly bring proposals to Government in advance of Committee Stage. This is an important piece of legislation aimed at creating a more level playing field between contractor and subcontractor in the construction sector. Therefore it is essential that these complex issues are properly assessed so as to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200062#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Service Contracts","counter":589,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200062#WRL01400"},{"type":"question","counter":590,"qnumday":325,"qnumall":"[6871\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200062#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the pre-qualification criteria for procuring public sector work should contain a solvency statement with a double lock mechanism, for example, that the solvency statement should be signed by the contractor, owner, their solicitor and their accountant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":591,"content":"<p>Public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts.

However, it is not possible for me to advise the Deputy as to the likely date for enactment of the Bill, as this depends on a number of factors which are outside my control, including the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.<\/p><p><br \/>  At the outset, let me say that the Bill will not change the basis of valuation for rating purposes. This will continue to be &#8220;net annual value&#8221; which is the hypothetical rental value of a property as assessed by reference to a specified date.<\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Bill amends several provisions contained in the Valuation Act 2001. These amendments include a number of technical changes to Part 5 of the 2001 Act which deals with how valuations, including revaluation of entire rating authority areas, are carried out. The Bill also proposes to amend Part 6, which deals with the carrying out of revisions of the rateable valuation of individual properties within rating authority areas between revaluations. In both instances, it is envisaged that the Commissioner of Valuation will appoint officers to carry out the tasks in question and the Bill makes specific provision for the appointment of &#8220;revision managers&#8221;. Section 6 of the Bill proposes to amend Section 19 of the Valuation Act 2001 by enabling the Commissioner to appoint persons to carry out the revaluation of entire rating authority areas. Such persons may be an officer of the Commissioner. However, provision is also made for the Commissioner to enter into an arrangement with a person or persons (other than officers of the Commissioner) to assist in the performance of the revaluation function. The effect of this provision is to enable the Commissioner to contract out some of the revaluation work, in order to augment the in-house capacity of the Valuation Office. This is one of the express provisions intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme. I understand that, following enactment of the Bill, the Commissioner intends running a pilot revaluation project which will utilise such external resources.<\/p><p><br \/>  Following enactment of the Bill, it is envisaged that revaluation projects can be conducted through <i>direct assessment<\/i> of the net annual value of properties, as heretofore. However, the Bill (Section 11, inserting a new Part 5A into the 2001 Act) also provides for the Commissioner to conduct a revaluation using elements of <i>self-assessment<\/i> by ratepayers. This provision is also intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme and I understand that, following enactment of the Bill, the Commissioner intends running a pilot project which will utilise self-assessment principles. Finally, I wish to draw the Deputy&#8217;s attention to Section 22 of the Bill which proposes to amend Section 48 of the 2001 Act by providing for the use of general market data or aggregated data (including <i>statistical and computer-aided techniques<\/i>  ) in determining valuations, where the Commissioner considers it appropriate to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200062#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coastal Protection","counter":604,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200062#WRL02900"},{"type":"question","counter":605,"qnumday":330,"qnumall":"[7078\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200062#WRL03000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if funding will be made available to carry out emergency coastal protection works in an area (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":606,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works is not aware of coastal erosion issues at this location.

In the current economic climate, and in particular bearing in mind the difficulties in the construction sector, it is likely that, where a business is awarded a public contract, in particular a small scale contract, the work would be carried out by the existing employees of that business. In such circumstances a social clause requiring apprentices to be employed in delivering a public contract could either impose an additional cost on SMEs that they may not be able to afford, or result in an existing employee being let go in favour of an apprentice. <\/p><p>  The Government has a wide range of measures that it is deploying to facilitate job creation and support labour activation, with particular emphasis on assisting the long term and young unemployed either enter the labour market or be given appropriate opportunities to reskill. Obviously, the main purpose of the public procurement process is to ensure that goods, services and works are purchased by the State in a manner that is legal, transparent and of high probity, and our key requirement is the achievement of value for money.  Within this context, my Department and the National Procurement Service are examining the use of social clauses as an additional means of supporting activation and we are seeking to identify the scope for the use of social clauses that could include provisions relating to training opportunities in parts of the capital area in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200062#WRL04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Remit","counter":619,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200062#WRL04400"},{"type":"question","counter":620,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[7131\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200062#WRL04500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to include An Taisce under the Freedom of Information Legislation;

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice. The first two elements involve the enhancement of the website   and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board (CIB), both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears. <\/p><p><br \/>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.<\/p><p><br \/>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice. The independent financial advice is available to all mortgage holders in respect of a mortgage secured on a primary residence who have been offered long-term forbearance options by their lenders.  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main accountancy bodies and the Irish Banking Federation. To date, some 2,700 accountants have confirmed to their accounting body that they wish to be part of the panel and their details are listed on a county by county basis on the website .<\/p><p><br \/>  Since its establishment, more than 2,400 people have contacted the Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline while there have been over 56,000 visits to    since June 2012.

This programme of work, which is known as the Standard Authentication Framework Environment or SAFE for short, also provided for the introduction of a Public Services Card (PSC) to enable individuals to gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while at the same time preserving their privacy to the maximum extent possible.<\/p><p>  A PSC is currently issued following a &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo; registration process which involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature and the verification of identity data already held by the Department.  As part of the registration process, applicants are requested to provide documentation supporting the authentication of their identity.  This is most easily achieved through the presentation of secure photographic ID such as a passport, National Identity card, driver&rsquo;s licence etc.<\/p><p>  The process does take into account that some people will not have such documents.    In the main, these will be UK or Irish nationals as others will require a valid passport or National ID card to be present in the jurisdiction.  The process for applicants without photo ID will take slightly longer as it involves a more in-depth interview focussing on the verification of personal information available to the Department.<\/p><p>  The creation of a SAFE registration environment involves improving the technical connectivity, installing new equipment and training staff in these offices to support the registration process. The registration process is now live in over 40 DSP Offices with 87 SAFE Stations in production and some 475 staff have been trained.  Approximately 125,000 PSCs have been issued to date.<\/p><p>  The majority of these cards have been issued to new claimants for Jobseekers Benefit\/Allowance and applicants for a new PPS number in Local Offices that have been equipped to carry out SAFE registrations. <\/p><p>  A small number of PSCs have also been issued through a reduced registration process using information already available to the State such as a passport application.  During 2013 this process will be extended to customers for whom a reduced process is appropriate.  With the range of registrations processes available, the number of PSCs to be produced from 2013 onwards will be significantly increased.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200063#WRM04400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Eligibility","counter":700,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200064#WRN00150"},{"type":"question","counter":701,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[6716\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200064#WRN00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will confirm the entitlements of a person (details supplied) in County Dublin; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":702,"content":"<p>The person concerned is in full-time education and is therefore unavailable for full-time employment.

This scheme was targeted at commercial salmon fishermen who were active in the fishery at the time and funding was provided to fishermen for them to leave the fishery and diversify into some new activity. <\/p><p>  The scheme was wound up in 2008 and all funds have been expended.  The Deputy will also appreciate that in the current financial circumstances there is no prospect of revisiting such a scheme.<\/p><p>  Conditions of the scheme included that nets had to be verifiably decommissioned to the satisfaction of the local Regional Fisheries Board and that no new licence would issue. <\/p><p>  This scheme was administered by Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) and an independent appeals officer appointed for any applicant that was aggrieved by the decision of BIM. <\/p><p>  The scheme was introduced because of Ireland&rsquo;s requirement to comply with national and international legislation and obligations which meant a closure of the drift net fishery. <\/p><p>  There were approximately 67 fishermen in the Waterford estuary who chose not to avail of the scheme.  These fishermen had previously held public fishing licenses. <\/p><p>  I am advised that the Waterford estuary is currently below its conservation limit and therefore there is no permitted salmon fishery in the estuary. Any future decision on a fishery could only be taken in the context of the estuary being above its conservation limit and at that stage national and international legislation and other obligations would have to be considered. <\/p><p>  Salmon conservation limits are set similarly for all of Ireland&rsquo;s 142 salmon rivers.  The advice of the Standing Scientific Committee has regard to a range of considerations, principally, the size of the river (wetted area) and the latitude.<\/p><p>  Other factors specific to each river include the proportion of one sea winter salmon and multi sea winter salmon in the population, and the average weight of these salmon. <\/p><p>  Other inputs to calculating conservation limits nationally are proportions of male and female salmon and average numbers of eggs per female fish.  The number of eggs required to spawn a given area of river is calculated from index rivers and then used to calculate the egg requirement on all other rivers.<\/p><p>  The total egg requirement is then calculated for each specific river using the river&rsquo;s wetted area and latitude.  This total egg requirement is then calculated as total adult spawning salmon required (the conservation limit), split into a spawning requirement for one sea winter and multi sea winter salmon.<\/p><p>  I am advised that the independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) for salmon revised the conservation limits for all rivers for the 2013 scientific advice. <\/p><p>  New estimates of river wetted area were made in 2012 and the wetted area estimate of the River Barrow increased from 649 to 760 hectares.  However, the proportion of multi sea winter salmon designated for the Barrow increased to 39%.  Overall, these changes resulted in the salmon conservation limit of the Barrow reducing from 12,117 salmon in 2012 to 11,737 salmon from 2013 onwards. <\/p><p>  The SSC have advised that salmon conservation limits will not be revised for a period of five years.  The achievement of the salmon conservation limit on the Barrow has been assessed previously using declared rod catch up to 2006 when the river was open to angling. Since then, catchment wide-electrofishing has been used to assess the levels of juvenile salmon throughout the catchment. <\/p><p>  The SSC advice for 2013 was the Barrow is failing to meet its conservation limit but the river has been opened for catch and release angling in 2013 which will provide data on the strength of the salmon stock.<\/p><p>  Salmon conservation limits for the Suir and Nore are set on a similar basis to that of the Barrow but using the wetted area and latitude for the Suir and Nore specifically.<\/p><p>  The Waterford estuary has a number of rivers entering the sea in the same area.  Prior to any commercial fishing being permitted in the estuary area it will be necessary for all the waters in the vicinity of the fishing location to be in surplus at the same time and for genetic analysis to have confirmed that no other stocks are mixed in the area. <\/p><p>If genetic assessment proves that the stocks in the area are specific to local rivers only, and that analysis shows that these stocks are above their conservation limit with a surplus available for exploitation, consideration could be given to a commercial fishery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200067#WRQ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Angling Season","counter":838,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200067#WRQ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":839,"qnumday":429,"qnumall":"[7070\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200067#WRQ01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will bring forward the date for the opening of the angling season on a river (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":840,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that, as each river has a genetically unique stock, Ireland&rsquo;s salmon rivers are managed on an individual basis by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI).

Details of broadband services available on a County-by-County basis can be found on the website of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) at www.callcosts.ie  .<\/p><p>  The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.<\/p><p>  The State only becomes involved in the provision of services in instances of clear market failure, such as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  My Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS.  The Scheme offers a basic broadband service, in line with EU State aid clearance, to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated Electoral Divisions.<\/p><p>  In County Meath, NBS services are available within 18 of its 92 Electoral Divisions.  The area of Kilbride was excluded from the NBS as it was deemed, at the time of the comprehensive mapping exercise carried out prior to the launch of the Scheme, to be already served by at least one private operator.  Under EU State Aid rules, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.<\/p><p>  The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision.  This Scheme was aimed at making a basic broadband service available to un-served premises in rural areas, not already covered by the NBS.  Commercial service providers were in a position to offer services to almost all applicants under the Scheme who agreed to engage with them, including applicants from County Meath.  In addition to consumer services, there are State-funded Metropolitan Area Networks in Navan, Dunboyne, Clonee, Dunsaughlin, Kells and Trim.  These networks provide high capacity fibre connectivity for businesses and telecoms operators in the region.<\/p><p>  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013, and the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  <\/p><p>  Specifically, it commits to: 70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population; and A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.<\/p><p>  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.<\/p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. <\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.<\/p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including Kilbride and other rural areas in County Meath, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200067#WRQ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":856,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 435 and 436, inclusive, answered with Question No. 433.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":857,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200067#WRQ02250"},{"type":"question","counter":858,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[7385\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200067#WRQ02300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the cost incurred by his Department for assessing means of individual citizens for any reason on an annual basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":859,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is not involved in any means testing of individuals.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200067#WRQ02400","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":861,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200067#WRQ02500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Eligibility","counter":860,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200067#WRQ02450"},{"type":"question","counter":861,"qnumday":438,"qnumall":"[6883\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200067#WRQ02500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if women who flee domestic violence situations in their own homes are entitled to be placed on a social housing waiting list; the legislation this is governed by; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":862,"content":"<p>There are a range of services available to deal with needs arising in cases of domestic violence, both in terms of protection of the abused partner and any children, and any need for emergency accommodation.

This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners.<\/p><p>Householders seeking to avail of the mortgage to rent scheme must:<\/p><p>- have been involved in the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) with their lender and agree that they can no longer afford to pay their mortgage loan now or in the future;<\/p><p>- own the property they live in, with a current market value of less than &euro;220,000 in the Dublin area or less than &euro;180 ,000 in the rest of the country;<\/p><p>- have their property in good condition, in a suitable location and which must suit their current needs ;<\/p><p>- not own any other property or have assets in excess of &euro;20,000;<\/p><p>- be eligible for social housing;<\/p><p>- have a long-term right to remain in Ireland.<\/p><p>At the end of 2012, 558 cases had been submitted by lenders.

Full details of those availing of the Scheme by end 2012 on a county basis are set out in the table below.<\/p><p>The numbers of completed transactions is low but significant progress has been made. All of the main lenders and so called sub-prime lenders are fully engaged and have instituted the necessary internal processes. It is also important to bear in mind that the transition from being a homeowner to a social housing tenant is a major one for families. Mortgage to rent or other such interventions cannot be rushed for any party. For example, the process provides a 60 day decision period and a 28 day cooling off period within the timeframe of the scheme. My Department estimates that the overall timeframe per case from start to completed transaction will be up to eight months. This compares favourably to the timeframes in other jurisdictions operating similar schemes.<\/p><p>My Department has budgeted for the resolution of roughly 250 Mortgage-To-Rent transactions in

The key legislative codes in that regard are the   Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2009 and the Waste Management Acts 1996 to 2011; in particular, section 32 of the 1996 Act places the responsibility on the holders of waste to ensure that it is managed in a manner that does not cause environmental pollution. <\/p><p>  Penalties available under the Litter Pollution Acts for litter offences range from an on-the-spot fine of &euro;150, to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction, and a maximum fine of &euro;130,000 on conviction on indictment. The fines for continuing offences are &euro;600 per day for summary offences and &euro;10,000 per day for indictable offences.   A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the court to pay the local authority&rsquo;s costs and expenses in investigating the offence and bringing the prosecution.      <\/p><p>  Penalties for more serious dumping offences provided for under the Waste Management Acts are also substantial. Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal of waste are liable to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction and\/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &euro;15 million on conviction on indictment and\/or imprisonment for up to 10 years.     <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the significant penalties currently in place , my Department is preparing legislative proposals t hat would provide for the introduction of on-the-s pot fines for incidences of fly-tipping or small- scale illegal dumping.

While having no operational role in these matters, my Department provides funding to support the activities of a network of local authority environmental enforcement officers. Each local authority sets out an annual programme of action, detailing the enforcement activities towards which this funding will be utilised. Typically, such programmes also include actions to tackle illegal dumping. I expect to be in a position to finalise 2013 funding allocations for this purpose in the coming weeks, in the context of finalising the overall allocations from the Environment Fund.      <\/p><p>  My Department also provides funding for an Anti-Litter Awareness Grant Scheme.

It does not include past time spent by residents who left the system for a period and subsequently sought and were granted re-access to the system.)<\/p><p>I acknowledge that the length of time spent in the direct provision system is an issue to be addressed. On the matter of application processing times and consequent length of time spent in the direct provision system, some cases can take significantly longer to complete owing to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.<\/p><p>For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to point out that persons who are refused a declaration under section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, enter what is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;leave to remain&rdquo; process which generally has two elements to it: an application for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. This is separate from the asylum or refugee status determination process. The processing of cases at this point is also complex and extremely resource intensive and there are no quick or easy decisions to make. Given the life changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.<\/p><p>I have taken steps to speed up the processing of applications, primarily by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies. The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, 2010 which I intend to republish provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State. This should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements. This reorganisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion.<\/p><p>Further, I recently approved an initiative to put in place a panel with legal expertise who will assist INIS  in processing a cohort of repatriation cases, thus speeding up the overall process and reducing the time spent by persons in the direct provision system. I would expect to see significant dividends, in terms of cases finalised, from this initiative in the coming months.<\/p><p>As to the system of direct provision itself, I have explained in detail in response to previous D&aacute;il Questions the reasons why it was introduced in 1999 in response to a situation where the structures then in place were entirely unsuited to the situation then pertaining and was necessary to prevent widespread homelessness among asylum seekers.The system remains a necessary feature of the State's asylum and immigration system and, as explained above, my efforts are concentrated on reducing the length of time persons stay in centres.<\/p><p>There are no cheaper alternatives to the direct provision system.  In fact, if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system. This was a key finding in the recent Value for Money Report on the direct provision system which was published in 2010 and is on the RIA website -  www.ria.gov.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200069#WRS03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":998,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200069#WRS03450"},{"type":"question","counter":999,"qnumday":488,"qnumall":"[6728\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200069#WRS03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when a person (details supplied) who has been living in direct provision for nine and a half years will have his case decided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1000,"content":"<p>The person concerned had a Deportation Order made against him, following the refusal of his asylum application, and his application for subsidiary protection, and the subsequent detailed consideration of his case under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).

There is no legal provision to allow for a reduction in a person's social welfare payments on the basis that he\/she has been granted a Criminal Legal Aid Certificate.  Any proposal to recoup criminal legal aid by reducing a person's social welfare payments would need careful consideration as a person's right to be legally represented in respect of criminal charges, if necessary at the expense of the State, is constitutionally protected.  The Deputy will appreciate my overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that criminal legal aid is granted by the courts.  Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in the performance of its functions.  In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that their Criminal Case Tracking System (CCTS) contains a record of legal aid granted by the District Court.  The records, however, are not kept in a manner which would allow for the extraction of information showing the number of times a person has been granted criminal legal aid.<\/p><p>  In October 2011 the Legal Aid Board commenced administering the ad hoc Garda Station Legal Advice Scheme which covers the provision of free legal advice to persons detained in respect of certain offences under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984, section 30 of the Offences against the State Act 1939, section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 and section 50 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007.   The Board is recording detailed data, including the number of persons availing of the scheme.  Their data show that from October 2011, a total of 666 persons have accessed the scheme on two or more occasions.  New legislation currently being drafted will assign responsibility to the Board for administration of the entire legal aid scheme which will facilitate, inter alia, the collection of data.

An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his\/her means are insufficient to enable him\/her to pay for legal aid and the court must also be satisfied that by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  The court may require the applicant to furnish a statement of his\/her means.  The granting or refusal of criminal legal aid is a matter determined by the judiciary.<\/p><p><br \/>  Total expenditure on Criminal Legal Aid for 2012 came to &#8364;50.5 million, a reduction of 10% over 2011.  This reduction in the annual expenditure is the largest ever recorded and represents a fall of approximately &#8364;10 million, or 16%, over the peak recorded in 2009.  The reductions follow savings measures I have introduced since coming into office including cuts to fees during 2011.  Other measures are being introduced with a view to speeding up criminal cases, cutting down on adjournments etc.  I am also considering, in the context of legislation currently being drafted, measures to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board. The Bill is likely to include provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid in certain circumstances or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.<\/p><p><br \/>  These provisions must have regard to the right to a fair trial, including the provision of legal aid where appropriate, which is a constitutional right upheld by the courts in a number of judgments.  The Supreme Court ruling in the case of <i>State (Healy) v Donoghue [1976]I.R. 325<\/i> effectively determined that the right to criminal legal aid is, in circumstances which are quite wide in practice, a constitutional right.  Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights states that &quot;<i>Everyone charged with a criminal offence has [the right] to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require&quot;. <\/i>   As the Deputy will be aware, an accused person is entitled to a presumption of innocence and legal representation and any obstacles to obtaining necessary legal aid which were found to be unreasonable could give a defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  Therefore, I have no plans at present to restrict the number of times a person can apply for legal aid.<\/p><p><br \/>  I hope the Deputy will appreciate that, while every effort is being made to contain costs, my overriding concern must be to ensure that any person charged with a criminal offence cannot evade trial.  Drafting of the legislation, which includes the transfer of administration to the Legal Aid Board, has not progressed to date due to other legislative priorities in my own Department and the Attorney General's Office but I hope to publish the Bill later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200070#WRT01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1019,"content":"<p>Question No. 494 answered with Question No. 491.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1020,"content":"<p>Question No. 495 answered with Question No. 492.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1021,"content":"<p>Question No. 496 answered with Question No. 491.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1022,"content":"<p>Question No. 497 answered with Question No. 492.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting Applications","counter":1023,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200070#WRT01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1024,"qnumday":498,"qnumall":"[6814\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200070#WRT01700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason for the delay in having Garda vetting clearance issued in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12.","asker":"1102","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1025,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a vetting application on behalf of the person concerned was received by the Garda Central Vetting Unit.

There can be a multiplicity of reasons why warrants can take time to execute and, in some cases, they can prove ultimately unenforceable, as the subjects of the warrants will often take every step open to them to try to avoid arrest through moving from address to address, leaving the country and so on.<\/p><p>I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that at present there is an Inspector in each Garda District in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and each Division outside the DMR tasked with managing the execution of warrants, and other issues relating to them. In addition, specific members of the Force are tasked with their execution. While it is clearly important that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na take all possible action to ensure that warrants are executed as quickly as possible, it should be borne in mind that the vast majority of warrants do not relate to violent or the more serious categories of offence.  In this regard, I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na give priority to the execution of warrants in respect of serious crime and will continue to do so.  I am also advised that there is a warrants working group in place which facilitates liaison between the various stakeholders, including the Court Service and the Prison Service and which works to identify, address and prevent difficulties in the warrants process. The work of the group is ongoing and relevant recommendations for the improvement of systems are being implemented on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>Of its nature, the figure for outstanding warrants recorded by PULSE at any given time reflects an accumulation of old warrants which has arisen over the years and I have been concerned that the total figure for outstanding warrants as shown on PULSE may not be a reliable indicator of the number of 'live' warrants which are enforceable which are on hand. In this regard, I have asked the Commissioner to consider whether there may be a better way of maintaining statistics which gives a more realistic indication in relation to any backlog of warrants.<\/p><p>There seems little doubt that the outstanding warrants figures for previous years reflected partly the situation which then obtained in relation to the use of imprisonment in cases of non-payment of fines, a practice which I think most people now regard as highly undesirable. Since the commencement of section 14 of the Fines Act 2010, a Court is now obliged to take into account the means of the person before imposing a fine.

It is expected that Government approval for the required legislation will be sought later this year. It is envisaged that a Bill will be published in 2014.  Under an existing 1983 Council of Europe Convention, to which Ireland is party, individuals convicted of an offence in another Convention state, and for which he or she has received a custodial sentence, may be transferred to their home state to serve that sentence.

The Bill is, therefore, a key component of the Government's strategy to reduce legal costs in this country by way of increasing our competitiveness, both sectorally and nationally.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Legal Services Regulation Bill makes extensive provision, particularly in Part 9, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients.  The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles.  These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account if disputed costs are submitted for adjudication.  These cost transparency measures will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors.  Under the Bill it will no longer be permissible to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business.  It will no longer be permissible to charge Junior Counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees.  Legal practitioners will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients.  This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions.  Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in Section 90 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated.  A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client.  When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Bill also provides that a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will deal with disputes about legal costs &#8211; at present these are dealt with by the Office of the Taxing-Master.  The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated with greater transparency.  The Office will be empowered to prepare Legal Costs Guidelines.  It will establish and maintain a publicly accessible Register of Determinations which will include the outcomes and reasons for its determinations about disputed legal costs.  Two new Taxing-Masters have been appointed by public competition under the enhanced qualification criteria of Part 14 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 to prepare the way for these modernisation measures.<\/p><p><br \/>  Taking account of developments and the pressures being experienced by legal practitioners in other open common law jurisdictions the Bill seeks to address the danger of Irish law firms and legal practitioners operating at a cost disadvantage.  Several types of new alternative business structure models have been, or continue to be, rolled-out in England and Wales, Scotland, Australia, Germany, Netherlands and parts of Canada in direct competition with Irish legal service providers - for example, solicitors, accountants and insurers practising as one business or &quot;multi-disciplinary practice&quot; providing their complementary services in a pooled and more cost-effective setting.  In other provisions the Bill lifts existing restrictions on direct professional access to a barrister and on barristers who share premises or costs from advertising themselves as such a group.  The Bill also allows that a barrister in employment may provide legal services for his or her employer.  The Bill, therefore, contains numerous measures aimed at opening up the provision of legal services to more responsive and more competitive legal service models building on the enormous advances that have been made in supporting business technologies.  Through its extensive legal costs transparency provisions and its provision for modern and more competitive business alternatives, the Legal Services Regulation Bill is providing an opportunity to ameliorate the cost to business and other consumers of legal services while also creating new business opportunities for the legal services sector.  I am confident that this concerted approach to reducing legal costs will be of lasting benefit to all consumers of legal services and contribute to our early national economic recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200071#WRU04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Firearms Seizures","counter":1128,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200071#WRU04050"},{"type":"question","counter":1129,"qnumday":533,"qnumall":"[7297\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200071#WRU04100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of firearms seized in each year since and including 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1130,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table shows the number of firearms seized in each year from 2005 to 2012.<\/p><p><b>Number of Firearms Seized in Each Year from 2005 to 2012.<\/b><\/p><p><pli4><table><tr><th><div>Year<\/div><\/th><th><div>Number Seized<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>2012<\/div><\/td><td><div>595<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2011<\/div><\/td><td><div>737<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2010<\/div><\/td><td><div>948<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2009<\/div><\/td><td><div>871<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2008<\/div><\/td><td><div>978<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2007<\/div><\/td><td><div>886<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2006<\/div><\/td><td><div>1009<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2005<\/div><\/td><td><div>939<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/pli4><\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Policing Plan for 2013 reflects the priorities which I have set for the current year and includes as a strategic goal the objective of confronting serious crime in all its forms, including armed crime.

I should emphasise that the certificate is a disclosure to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.  Each time a new vetting application is received, new and full vetting checks are conducted.  This is to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.  Accordingly the processing time remains the same whether for new applications or cases where previous vetting has occurred.

Prior to this any surveying for the disease had yielded negative results. Following the finding a major survey was initiated by the Department part of which was a winter survey of all ash plantations of imported stock planted during 2009 &#8211; 2012. This exercise has now been completed.    The plantation survey is ongoing and is now looking at a larger timeframe of plantings. <\/p><p><br \/>  Well over 100 samples were sent for analysis from the winter plantation survey. In total there are currently 26 forestry plantations with imported ash that have tested positive; with trace-forward of the associated trees in the batches this represents over 120 sites. In addition a member of the public reported a suspected garden ash tree and this also tested positive. A further occurrence has been confirmed on ash growing on the surrounds of a farm.  Department officials are also surveying forestry and horticultural nurseries, motorways as well as farm plantings.  There have been positive samples in 14 separate horticultural nurseries and 1 garden centre. In relation to the motorways I can report that 3 sites have been identified as having the disease. <\/p><p>The Department&#8217;s forestry officials are working with the forestry contractors and the owners to remove the ash trees on these 120-  plus sites, under a reconstitution scheme. This scheme is being put in place and its terms and conditions will be available shortly.  An individual Sanitation Action Plan will be put in place for each of the sites affected. This will set out in detail the procedures to be followed at the specified site. It will cover actions such as disposal of infected material and proper hygiene measures etc. <\/p><p>On 26 October legal measures were also introduced to prohibit the importation into Ireland of plant material from ash dieback infected areas.  These measures, introduced by Ministerial Order, took effect immediately. Ireland imported over 200,000 ash plants in 2011.<\/p><p>On 6   November legislation was introduced to restrict the movement of ash wood into the country (in addition to plant material).  The legislation allows ash wood movement into Ireland if the wood is; (1) accompanied by a plant passport certifying that it comes from an area free of the disease or; (2) free of outer round surface (no passport required) or; (3) kiln dried below 20% moisture (no passport required). <\/p><p>The legal measures were introduced in conjunction with similar measures taken by Northern Ireland authorities.    <\/p><p>Before the legislation was introduced Department officials notified the European Commission and the other Member States of the first finding of <i>Chalara fraxinea<\/i> in Ireland and the actions taken to destroy the material and its intention to take emergency measures under the EU Plant Health Directive to prevent the further introduction of <i>Chalara fraxinea.<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  Department officials continue to work closely with their colleagues in Northern Ireland and Great Britain to ensure that all the appropriate measures are taken to tackle this disease.

The intention of such a statutory Code is not to protect one stakeholder over another or to prevent stakeholders from engaging in robust contractual negotiations or to determine the price of grocery goods.

The latter regulation, came into effect on 1 July 2009, provides that equine animals registered after that date<b><\/b>  must be identified with a passport and a microchip. <\/p><p>The EU legislation has been transposed into national legislation via S.I. No. 357 of 2011 - European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011 (as amended).  This legislation provides that if an equine animal has not been identified within six months of the date of its birth, or by the 31 December in the year of its birth, whichever date occurs later, then the equine animal cannot be admitted to the food chain. S.I. No 357 of 2011 was amended in September 2012 by S.I. 371 of 2012 in order to strengthen the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of an issuing body for equine passports and prosecutions in relation to equine identification and to make it an offence to forge or tamper with an equine passport.<\/p><p>My Department introduced enhanced<b><\/b>legislation and<b><\/b>  procedures in relation to the registration of horse premises such that, from 1 May 2012, anyone who is the owner\/person in charge of any premises on which horses are kept is required to register the premises with my Department.  Keepers seeking to register equines are required to have a herd number registered with my Department and to keep records of movements on\/off their premises.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department also introduced enhanced procedures for the slaughter of horses in abattoirs in October 2011 and communicated these and the checks required both to its staff and the business operators. These procedures provide that an official veterinarian must be present in a meat plant when slaughtering is taking place. All animals are subject to an antemortem inspection, which includes an identification check, by an official veterinarian prior to slaughter. Where forged or tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, it is Department policy that such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department is developing a central database of horses which will involve migration of selected data from Passport Issuing Organisations to the Department and may include information from records obtained at slaughter plants, knackeries, sales and live exports.  The intention is that this database will be used at abattoirs to verify the authenticity of the passport for the equine presented and to record its date of slaughter. <\/p><p><br \/>  As indicated above, the legislative basis for the identification of equines resides in EU legislation, as transposed into Irish legislation, and it is not open to me unilaterally to apply the EU provisions relating to the identification of bovines to the equidae sector. Apart from this, not all components of the cattle system would be appropriate for equines, not least the requirement to use tags in both ears. However, I will continue to review existing legislation to establish if a need exists to bring forward further provisions to strengthen the traceability system for horses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRW04300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":1258,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRW04350"},{"type":"question","counter":1259,"qnumday":580,"qnumall":"[7050\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRW04400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when an agri environment option scheme payment will be awarded in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry.","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1260,"content":"<p>The person named was approved for participation in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme with effect from the 1 September 2010 and full payments totalling &euro;1,666.66 and &euro;4,999.98 issued in respect of 2010 and 2011 respectively. <\/p><p>  Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue.

Among the key drivers of future beef export performance in these markets will be the general macro-economic environment, the EU demand\/supply balance and exchange rate developments, particularly with regard to the euro vis-&agrave;-vis sterling.<\/p><p><br \/>  The immediate outlook for Irish beef output is that it is forecast to rise by 10% in 2013 as reduced live exports over recent years boost volumes. Global beef supplies are likely to remain stable and, as a result, EU imports are unlikely to increase significantly in 2013. The challenge will be to maintain price levels but continuing tight availability of beef across Europe should help exporters. Concomitant with this broadly positive outlook is a continuing improvement in the positioning of Irish beef exports in key markets with over 60% of export volumes now destined for the higher value standard retail, premium food service, and retail or quick service sectors. <\/p><p>Exploiting the strong sustainability credentials of the grass-fed beef will be a key element in maintaining and expanding markets for the Irish beef industry up to 2015. In this context, the 32,000<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>members of the Bord Bia Beef Quality Assurance (QA) Scheme are committed to actively measuring and reducing their carbon emissions. This is the only QA programme in the world that has an environmental element operating on a national basis. This important initiative will give Irish beef exports a genuine competitive advantage in securing premium product status in fiercely competitive foreign markets. Innovative product offerings supported by appropriate marketing are the best means of increasing market returns and viability across the supply chain.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, the leading Irish beef processing companies have also embraced the concept of sustainability under Origin Green. This is a comprehensive national sustainability development programme, the first of its kind in the world, designed by Bord Bia to assist Ireland to become known as the optimum source of sustainably produced food and drink. Industry recruitment commenced in June 2012 and to date a total of 188 companies have signed up to the programme. Central to the Origin Green concept is a sustainability charter that will commit Ireland&#8217;s agri-food industry, including beef processors, to engage directly and robustly with the challenges of sustainable production: reducing energy inputs, minimizing their overall carbon footprint and lessening their impact on the environment.<\/p><p><br \/>  Notwithstanding the fact that most Irish beef exports go to other EU member states, it is always beneficial to have a wide range of market outlets available for our beef products. My Department will be working &#8211; in collaboration with the industry, Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade &#8211; to secure access to more third country outlets for Irish beef over the next three years. At present, Irish beef enjoys access to markets in Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Russia, Hong Kong and Singapore.<\/p><p><br \/>  I have been assiduous in nurturing relationships in new and growing markets in order to build confidence in Irish production and control systems which will underpin long-term trading relationships in the future. As part of that effort, I headed trade missions last year to China and the USA, during which I raised the subject of access for Irish beef with my ministerial counterparts. Apart from China and the US, other targeted markets for Irish beef access include Japan and Korea as well as North African and Middle Eastern countries. My Department is engaging closely with the authorities in those countries to gain access for Irish beef products. There is a strong demand for beef globally and my Department remains focused, in consultation with the industry, on ensuring that Irish exporters will be able to fully exploit market opportunities as they arise over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRX02500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry Development","counter":1304,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRX02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1305,"qnumday":594,"qnumall":"[7370\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRX02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he expects the fishing industry to develop over the coming four years with particular reference to likely fish catches under various species headings and the anticipated added value to processing arising therefrom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1306,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware individual fishing opportunities and quotas are determined on an annual basis by the EU Fisheries Council in line with the mechanisms and procedures laid down in the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).

The weather affected harvests with drought in the USA and the Black Sea region leading to lower output and consequent upward pressure on prices.<\/p><p><br \/>  Following rebuilding and recovery efforts in recent years the future for the Irish pig sector remains challenging. Notwithstanding recent cereal price reductions, input prices are forecast to remain above long-term averages for the foreseeable future. In addition, difficulties in the non-feed elements of production such as credit availability, energy costs and compliance with the EU Loose Sow Housing Directive which came into force in January 2013 together with the decline in the size of the breeding herd pose significant challenges to producers. EU output is forecast to decline by 2-3% in 2013 which conversely will offer increased opportunities to Irish producers. However, the ongoing issues referred to above together with the near 7% decline in the Irish breeding herd in 2012, may limit Irish producers&#8217; scope to avail of these openings.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to the Loose Sow Housing Directive, an on-farm investment aid scheme (TAMS) &#8211; the Sow Housing Welfare Scheme was introduced under Ireland&#8217;s Rural Development Programme 2007 &#8211; 2013, to facilitate producer compliance with the requirements. The scheme has been enhanced and extended on a number of occasions. While the majority of producers have worked extremely hard to achieve compliance, my Department became aware that a small number of producers had experienced difficulties with planning permission. With this in mind, I recently announced a further extension in the deadline for grant applications until 2 April 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  I have provided a total of &#8364;16 million for this scheme. I should add that this funding is in addition to earlier Sow Welfare Schemes which delivered over &#8364;6 million to successful applicants. <\/p><p><br \/>  With regard to financial support available to the pig industry, Enterprise Ireland operates various programmes relating to company development. Included among these are Research and Development and Innovation Funding. Through a mix of funding, advice and expertise, Enterprise Ireland works with companies planning or engaging in R&amp;D. Assistance for product development is also available through the Teagasc National Food Centre in Ashtown, Dublin 15. A number of businesses within the pig sector have availed of these programmes in recent years.<\/p><p><br \/>  Teagasc, through its Moorepark pig research facility and the provision of FETAC courses in pig production and benchmarking pig herd performance, plays a critically important role in improving productive capacity at farm level. Teagasc have also circulated pig producers with a number of the options available to them to reduce feed costs and improve feed efficiency. <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, Teagasc continues on an ongoing basis to develop enhanced systems of research, technical assistance and knowledge transfer in order to assist the pig sector.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In so far as international trade in Irish pigmeat is concerned, my Department has been extremely active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long term trading relationships in the future. <\/p><p><br \/>  And of course Bord Bia continues, through its promotional activities, and through the pigmeat quality assurance scheme, to help consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and international markets. This is proving particularly successful in international markets, primarily Russia and China where the value of Irish pigmeat exports grew to over &#8364;110 million in 2012. <\/p><p><br \/>  It is important to remember that pigmeat remains the most consumed meat worldwide and this will continue to present opportunities for Irish producers, given our self-sufficiency. In addition, the measures outlined above, together with the progress made in the last few years in establishing and consolidating a presence in important international markets will better position Irish producers to take advantage of growing demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRX02900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare Issues","counter":1310,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRX02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1311,"qnumday":596,"qnumall":"[7372\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRX03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which the farming community has been in a position to comply with requirements arising from animal welfare requirements in the context of the provision of improved animal housing arrangements; if adequate resources have been made available by the lending institutions to meet such requirements, if any outstanding issues remain; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1312,"content":"<p>New EU Animal Welfare rules setting down new standards in relation to the housing of sows came into force on 1 January 2013.

The EU will prepare for this by facilitating discussion and organising a conference under the auspices of DG-Agri in Autumn 2013.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Family farming has always been the main form of farming in Ireland.  The key difficulties that I have seen are the lack of succession planning and the lack of availability of farm land for new entrants.  To meet these challenges new taxation measures were introduced in the last two budgets aimed at improving land mobility and farm consolidation, and encouraging transfers to younger, more progressive farmers.  Stamp duty on agricultural land was reduced from 6% to 2%.  In addition, half the rate (1%) is now applicable on transfers to close relatives until the end of 2014. This change substantially reduced the stamp duty payable on transfers of farm land by gift or by sale. The measure promotes inter-generational transfer, as the cost of lifetime transfer to transferees who do not qualify for the young trained farmer stamp duty relief has been reduced considerably.<\/p><p><br \/>  Budget 2012 also restructured the retirement relief available on Capital Gains Tax in order to incentivise the earlier transfer of farm assets to the next generation, and to encourage the sale of land by those farmers with no successors. <\/p><p><br \/>  Retirement relief was restructured in order to encourage farmers around the normal retirement age, who have successors, to transfer their land and holdings to young, innovative, ambitious, prospective farmers. This measure encourages an improvement in the age profile of farmers, and should ensure that farmland is put to more productive use.<\/p><p><br \/>  It should be noted that there has been no change to the very important 90% agricultural relief on Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT). This means that farms worth up to &#8364;2.5 million will continue to be fully exempt from CAT with regard to transfers to a child.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am also happy that the new restructuring relief has been announced in the 2013 budget.  This is the result of detailed work which analysed the reasons why the old consolidation relief was not working.  I am confident that the new relief in relation to Capital Gains Taxes, once State Aid approval has been received, will be more effective, especially given that Stamp Duty rates have been reduced.  Re-structuring is essential for us to meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  We need to use land more productively and encourage more young farmers to make the best use of the land. A recent EU Commission study found that <\/p><p>&#8216;<i>younger[farm] managers tend to perform better than the EU average, with 46% more area and 57% more economic potential for 21% more labour force<\/i>&#8217;<sup> [[1]<\/sup>  Commission Staff Working Paper, Impact Assessment, CAP towards 2020, <i>Annex 1: Situation and prospects for EU agriculture and rural areas<\/i>, p. 25. Brussels, 12\/10\/2011.<sup>1]<\/sup>.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland has a very low level of land sales, with most land staying within the same family for generations. Only 0.4% of land changes hand in any given year.  Young farmers that want to expand need to be able to access land.  According to the latest census of agriculture the average farm has 3.8 land parcels.  This means that our farmers are wasting time and diesel driving between plots of land, increasing the stress and the risk of accidents.  Young farmers will now have an opportunity to consolidate their holdings and increase efficiency.  <\/p><p><br \/>  I also believe that family farms are the places where young people can learn the required skills in partnership with parents and other family members.  Indeed Irish farming greatly benefits from the pooling of skills and knowledge of all family members and in this regard I would strongly encourage greater participation by women in farm decision making and management.  I am confident that providing an additional incentive to farm partnership formation will encourage farmers to consider more closely the benefits of farm partnerships to their farming business and in providing a better work-life balance. <\/p><p><br \/>  Encouraging farm partnerships will also support the dairy herd expansion required over the coming years, enabling Irish farmers to avail of the opportunity presented by the abolition of EU milk quotas in March 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRX03500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Safety Standards Regulation","counter":1319,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRX03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1320,"qnumday":599,"qnumall":"[7375\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRX03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the degree to which he and his Department expects to be in a position to counter any negativity arising from recent traceability or quality breakdowns with particular reference to quality assurance on worldwide markets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1321,"content":"<p>Following the findings of the FSAI Survey on the authenticity of meat products (published on January 15), which disclosed the presence of horse meat in burgers and the identification in the follow up investigation of the source, the problem has developed into a pan European investigation of food fraud involving a range of meat products and traders\/food business operators.<\/p><p>  My aim throughout this situation has been to ensure that everything possible is done to fully restore consumer confidence in the Irish meat sector. I asked Bord Bia to maintain constant contact with our export markets to reassure international buyers that there is no food safety issue involved and that the issue has been dealt with swiftly and appropriately by the Irish authorities. Initial market impact at consumer level (weekend of Jan 20th  ) indicated that the controversy was largely confined within the UK and Irish markets, where the affected products were on sale and taken off the shelf, where the media coverage has been intense and consumer awareness very high. The research indicated that consumers were ring-fencing the problem to this particular segment of the market, and not extending or generalising it to the wider industry. The processed meat sector is a relatively limited segment of the total Irish meat market and is not otherwise impacting on Irish food exports. Beyond these markets, media coverage, interest and awareness has been limited and no concerns whatever have been reported to Bord Bia by trade buyers or consumers. The fact that our controls identified this particular issue and the manner in which it has been addressed will assist in maintaining the confidence in Irish food.<\/p><p>  The Irish beef industry has a blue chip portfolio of high end supermarket and food service business in Europe&rsquo;s consumer markets that is without parallel.

More than 75% of all Irish beef exported is produced from some 34,000 farms which are members of the Bord Bia Quality Assurance Scheme. Similarly, under Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green programme, most of our meat exporters have also signed up to the implementation of a sustainability plan that commits them to the achievement of stretch targets in key areas around emissions, water, biodiversity and health and well-being. Based on these programmes Bord Bia will continue to strongly assert our high quality standards and green credentials at every opportunity.

Under AEOS II<b><\/b>5,070 of the 6,250 approved applicants have been paid in respect of 2011.  Applicants have been informed of outstanding queries.  2012 represents the first full year payment for AEOS 2 applicants and in order to activate payment where non productive capital investments were selected a valid capital investment claim form must have been submitted.  The high level of queries and farmer delays in submitting valid claims has resulted in a lower than expected level of 2012 payments under AEOS 2.  Nearly 2,100 have received payment at this stage and to deal with outstanding queries additional resources have been directed to this area with the intention of clearing the backlog as soon as possible.  Requests and reminders have issued to farmers that have not submitted valid claim forms and where applicants have received correspondence in this regard they should respond as soon as possible.<\/p><p><br \/>  Grant payments under Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) are also subject to eligibility checks including on farm inspections in order to assess eligibility and payments are dependent on the completion of the project concerned and submission of a valid, documented claim.

Most of the fisheries resource within the area comes under the remit of the EUs Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). In June 2012, the European Commission reported that fish stocks in European waters are improving (EC COM(2012) 278 final). The proportion of overfished stocks in the Atlantic declined from around 90% of all stocks between 2005-2009 to 47% in 2012. Several stocks in the west of Scotland, Irish Sea and Celtic sea have suffered from being over fished in the past and remain at relatively low levels (i.e. Cod in Divisions VIa and VIIa, Sole in Division VIIa, Whiting in Divisions VIa and VIIa). Scientific advice is that exploitation rates of these depleted stocks appears to remain high in most cases despite significant reductions in fishing effort over the last decade (EC COM(2012) 278. <\/p><p>  The Marine Institute has given a workable definition to sustainable fisheries ie  when a fishery  can be &lsquo;conducted over the long term at an acceptable level of biological and economic productivity, without leading to ecological changes that exclude options for future generations&rsquo;. Optimum levels of biological and economic productivity are in part management decisions, but though considerable progress has been made in recent years in terms of addressing sustainability issues it is clear that for many stocks there is still room for further improvement. The European Union and Member States have committed themselves to reach the objectives of fishing at MSY by 2015 where possible. <\/p><p>  Reform of the CFP itself which is currently under discussion at EU level will help to address many of the key long term fisheries sustainability issues. The advancement of this reform agenda  has been prioritised by the Irish EU Presidency.   Current proposals for CFP reform encompass a range of innovative proposals for measures to eliminate the practice of  discards, achieving appropriate maximum long term sustainable yields (MSYs) and the introduction of effective fair transparent regionalisation mechanisms.  It is my belief that the introduction and implementation of these necessary and timely reforms (which must be adopted under co-decision jointly by the EU Fisheries Council and the EU Parliament) will support the ongoing development of a sustainable and thriving Irish and European fishing industry for the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRY00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1341,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRY00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1342,"qnumday":606,"qnumall":"[7382\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRY00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the cost incurred by his Department for assessing means of individual citizens for any reason on an annual basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1343,"content":"<p>My Department does not assess the means of individual citizens and as such does not incur any associated costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRY00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dairy Equipment Scheme Appeals","counter":1344,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRY00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1345,"qnumday":607,"qnumall":"[7397\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRY00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide an update on the outstanding appeal payment in resect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1346,"content":"<p>The person concerned is an applicant for grant-aid under the TAMS Dairy Equipment Scheme.

However, there was a recognition at the time of the difficulties of regulating the childminding sector, given its scale and the strong view that women should not be subject to regulation if they minded a small number of additional children.  As a result, the majority of childminders are exempt from the Regulations currently in place.<\/p><p>  The 2000 Expert Working Group on Childcare set out a plan for integrating the various strands of child care and education, including childminding.  It made a number of recommendations aimed at overcoming the barriers preventing childminders from moving into the formal economy, most of which have been implemented.  These included the introduction of a system for voluntary notification of childminders, and the introduction of Childcare Services Relief, which allows a voluntarily-notified childminder to mind up to three children without paying tax on the earnings and to make a PRSI contribution.<\/p><p>  In 2002, the Health Service Executive (HSE) agreed to fund a Childminding Advisory Officer post in each county, who would work with the 33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) funded under the Childcare Programme, implemented by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The role included notifying childminders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the voluntary notification system which was being developed by the CCCs.<\/p><p>  While Childminding Advisory Officers were established in most county areas, this was not always the case and they were not always located with the local CCC.  Despite their presence and the additional supports including training, a small capital grant scheme and the introduction of a tax relief for childminding in 2006, the increase in the number of voluntarily-notified childminders since 2004, when the number was 500, has been relatively small and levelled off at 1,250.<\/p><p>  In recent years, HSE funding for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts has gradually decreased, and is no longer in place in some areas.  I understand that this is due to pressure on HSE resources and the need to prioritise funding to other areas of front-line services.  While this is not a welcome development, I would point to the fact that the CCCs are now well-established and effective bodies at local level, and that supporting the childminding sector is an integral part of their work.  As a result, childminders continue to have access to support, training and advice.<\/p><p>  My Department provides annual funding to each CCC to enable them to support and advise all childcare providers at local level.  In 2012, the total amount allocated to the CCCs was &euro;11.3m.  In addition, in 2012 my Department provided &euro;220,000 to the CCCs for Childminding Development Grants.  My Department also provides annual funding, totalling &euro;2.85m in 2012, to seven National Voluntary Childcare Organisations to provide support at a local level to their members.  This included &euro;358,000 for Childminding Ireland, the representative body for childminders.<\/p><p>  My Department has commenced work on Ireland's first Early Years Strategy.  One of the policy issues which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the Early Years Strategy is the development of the childminding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for the under-one age group.<\/p><p>  Under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006, services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the HSE.   Childminders taking care of not more than three pre-school children from different families are not covered by the Regulations and are not required to notify.   Decisions on how best to regulate and support the childminding sector will continue to form part of the ongoing work on the Early Years Strategy.<\/p><p>  As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the Child Care Regulations set the minimum standards which services are legally required to comply with.  However, my Department is pro-active in monitoring, promoting and developing the highest standards of care and education throughout the sector, including the regulatory environment, given the important role which these services play in this crucial phase of children&rsquo;s lives.<\/p><p>The Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which I published in 2011, provides clarity and guidance for individuals and organisations in identifying and responding appropriately to child abuse and neglect. It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation. The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First.  I published the Heads of the Children First Bill   in April 2012. The purpose of publishing the Heads was to allow for a full consultation at an early stage on developing the Bill. <\/p><p>  I asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to consider the Heads of the Children First Bill and make recommendations.  I received their comprehensive Report and my Department is currently considering the broad range of submissions to, and recommendations of the Joint Committee, including those submissions pertaining to the issue of childminders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRY01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Educational Welfare Board","counter":1353,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRY01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1354,"qnumday":610,"qnumall":"[7416\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRY01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"subsequent to the elimination of the visiting teacher service for Travellers, the details of the number of Travellers assisted by the National Education and Welfare Board for the past year for which she has information and the educational outcomes therefrom; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1028","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1355,"content":"<p>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) was established in 2002 under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000.

I met with the Board of the VHI on 19 December last and with the Chair and CEO last month to voice my concerns and to emphasise the absolute need for VHI to manage its costs.  Given VHI&rsquo;s very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs and to address aggressively the base cost of procedures including professional fees.  I have consistently urged the VHI and all health insurers to do everything possible to keep down the cost of health insurance and I am determined to address costs in the sector, in the interests of consumers.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to keeping down the cost of health insurance so that it is affordable for as many people as possible and remains committed to protecting community rating, whereby everyone pays the same price for the same health insurance product, irrespective of age or health status.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2012 introduced a new permanent Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) for the private health insurance market with effect from 1 January 2013.   An effective and robust RES is required  in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.   The Scheme is also of benefit to insurers with increased adverse risks, in particular, the VHI.<\/p><p>  My officials have had a number of discussions with VHI officials to assist them in understanding the divergence between their calculation of the effectiveness of the new RES  and that of my Department. My Department has also conferred with its actuarial advisors who have concluded that the calculation methodology used by VHI understates the effectiveness of the scheme. In addition, the Health Insurance Authority ( HIA) , the industry regulator, has confirmed, based on market average claim costs for prescribed benefits, that the 2013 scheme compensates for 75% of the higher claims costs for those aged in their seventies and compensates for 83% of the higher claims costs for those aged in their eighties. The 2013 scheme has also provided for a measure of health status whereby an amount of &euro;75 per night will be payable from the Risk Equalisation Fund in respect of each hospital stay involving an overnight stay in a hospital bed in private hospital accommodation, including in a designated private bed in a publicly funded hospital.  This measure benefits each insurer who pays for a customer to use an overnight hospital bed and also benefits VHI to a significant level given its market share and customer profile.<\/p><p>  I should also point out that compensation levels under risk equalisation are based on average claims for the market as a whole rather than on the claims for any particular insurer such as VHI.  To do otherwise might be seen as providing an incentive for inefficiencies in claims cost management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRY03900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1395,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRY03950"},{"type":"question","counter":1396,"qnumday":624,"qnumall":"[6581\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WRY04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made to date in implementing a Vision for Change; the reason there is a priority to review the Mental Health Act 2001 prior to replacing the Vision for Change implementation expert group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1014","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1397,"content":"<p>Implementation of <i>A Vision for Change<\/i> (AVFC) and the reform of our mental health services is a priority for this Government.  plementation of AVFC has been slower than originally expected.

Progress also includes shorter episodes of in-patient care and the involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health policy, service planning and delivery. <\/p><p><br \/>  A modern mental health service is best delivered in the community and in 2012 a special allocation of &#8364;35m was provided primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both adult and children&#8217;s mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention, to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems and to facilitate the re-location of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities, in line with AVFC  <i>. <\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  Budgetary pressures within the HSE delayed the full utilisation of this funding, but this sum is now available to mental health services along with an additional &#8364;35m allocated in Budget 2013 for the continued development of mental health services across a range of headings, including the further ongoing development of community services.  This represents a total of &#8364;70m additional revenue to modernise and reform our mental health services in 2013.  Over 800 new mental health professionals are being employed to strengthen these services.  <\/p><p><br \/>  I presume the Deputy is referring to the Independent Monitoring Group for <i>A Vision for Change<\/i> which ceased its term in June 2012.

While a limited review was conducted in 2007, a more comprehensive review is required now as Part Two of the Act only commenced in November 2006.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to review the Mental Health Act 2001 and in June 2011, I appointed a Steering Group to undertake the first phase of the review.  The terms of reference for the initial phase of the review required the Steering Group to consider &#8220;<i>the extent to which the recommendations of A Vision for Change could or should be underpinned by legislation&#8221;.  <\/i>  This was done on the basis that the Mental Health Act 2001 which was enacted five years before the publication of AVFC does not reflect the significant changes in thinking about the delivery of mental health services that have taken place in the last ten years, such as the shift to community based services, the adoption of a recovery approach in every aspect of service delivery and the involvement of service users as partners in their own care and in the development of the service.  <\/p><p><br \/>  With the direct connection between the Mental Health Act and <i>A Vision for Change<\/i>, it makes sense that we finalise our work on the review of the Act before considering a review of <i>Vision.<\/i>   I expect that the review of the Act will be completed and presented to me in quarter two of this year.

Under UHI, everyone will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Department is preparing a White Paper on Universal Health Insurance which will provide further detail on the UHI model for Ireland in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance. The work involved is both complex and technical, necessitating significant research and financial modelling to support analysis and costing of different design options.  This, in turn, demands a wide-range of specialised expertise. The Department is engaged in a process to ensure the provision of this expertise to feed into work on the preparation of the White Paper during 2013.  The White Paper will be published as early as possible within the Government&#8217;s term of office.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In advance of the White Paper, my Department has produced a Preliminary Paper on UHI, which I intend to publish shortly. <\/p><p>The reform programme is a major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing over a number of years.

These Programmes have three main objectives &ndash; to improve the quality of care, to improve access and to improve cost-effectiveness.  Their primary aim is to modernise the way hospital services are provided across a wide range of clinical areas.  This is being done through standardising access to and delivery of high quality, safe and efficient hospital services and maximising linkages to primary care and other community services.  Cork and Beaumont are two of six regional centres which have been identified for the provision of specialist epilepsy services under the Clinical Care Programme for Epilepsy.  It is intended that services will be provided by a team of nurses and consultant neurologists working as a virtual national network supporting all acute and primary care locations.  Rapid Access Clinics (separate to the Epilepsy Monitoring Units) have been developed at four of centres so far and 10.5 (WTE) Advanced Nurse Practitioners have been recruited to lead these clinics, so that a total of 12 Advanced Nurse Practitioners are now in place across the four centres.   When the Epilepsy Monitoring Units in CUH and Beaumont are open, they will increase pre-surgical evaluation capacity.  Monitoring is required for the most vulnerable patients with the worst effects of epilepsy and their development is therefore a priority for the Programme.  Patients at these units will require 24\/7 care.  The staffing requirements to enable the units to be safely opened have been identified.<\/p><p>  With regard to recruitment, the Government has decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced to meet its fiscal and budgetary targets.  The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction.  However, the HSE can make staff appointments once it remains within its overall employment ceiling and has the financial resources to do so.  I understand that the normal processes will apply to the HSE&rsquo;s decisions regarding the recruitment of the required staff in CUH and Beaumont.  With regard to Beaumont, the HSE has advised that Beaumont Hospital and the HSE are working jointly to fill the posts necessary to support service development.  I am advised that the staffing required for the unit includes five staff nurses, one consultant neurophysiologist and three technicians.  Of these, three staff nurse posts and one technician post remain to be recruited.  I am informed that this is being prioritised.  The recruitment of nursing personnel is a key element to facilitate phased opening of the unit as nursing staff come into post.  With regard to Cork, the HSE has advised that the Service Plan for 2013 for CUH is being drawn up currently and will be finalised in the coming weeks, and that the provision of additional staff for the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit is being considered as part of that process. <\/p><p>  With regard to the issue of exemption from generic substitution of anti-epileptic drugs, under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill, the Irish Medicines Board has statutory responsibility for establishing and publishing a List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products.  In making a decision to add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the board is obliged to have regard to the criteria set out in the Bill.  These criteria fully reflect the recommendations set out in the Joint Department of Health\/HSE report &quot;Proposed Model of Reference Pricing and Generic Substitution&quot; (the Moran Report, 2010) regarding criteria for interchangeability.  To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.

New rosters are now in place, including in the greater Dublin area, and are operating successfully.  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has developed key performance indicators (KPIs) for pre-hospital emergency care, which classify 999 emergency calls by clinical status.  Clinical Status 1 (Echo) calls involve life-threatening emergencies of cardiac or respiratory origin, while Clinical Status 1 (Delta) calls involve life-threatening emergencies other than cardiac or respiratory.  The target times for responding to Echo and Delta calls are 7 minutes 59 seconds by a first responder (a person trained in minimum basic life support and use of a defibrillator) and 18 minutes 59 seconds for a patient-carrying vehicle.  With effect from January 2012, HIQA set the standard at 75% within the target time for first responders and a target has been set at 80% within the target time for patient-carrying vehicles.<\/p><p>The NAS has been taking a number of steps to improve emergency responses.

The report will then be submitted to the Board of the Authority for approval before publishing it a time the Authority deems appropriate.<\/p><p>  The Coroner's Office held a preliminary inquest hearing on 18th January last and  is scheduled to commence its full inquest during April.

The Involuntary admission of persons to a psychiatric hospital or unit in the 1950's and 1960's was governed by the 1945 Mental Treatment Act. The 1945 Act allowed for the admission and detention without their consent, of a person as a  'temporary patient' or a 'person of unsound mind'  following an application received and accompanied by a medical certificate, signed by a doctor and on foot of a reception order signed by a consultant psychiatrist. <\/p><p>  There were no provisions in the 1945 Act for an automatic right of appeal to an independent judicial body against a person's involuntary detention in a psychiatric hospital.

It also required the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, in the course of his inspections, to visit any patient &quot;the propriety of whose detention he had reason to doubt&quot;.<\/p><p>  The Mental Health 2001 Act significantly modernised procedures relating to involuntary admission by establishing for the first time independent Mental Health Tribunals which review, and affirm or revoke detention orders.

There is not a community in Ireland that has not been affected by suicide.  We know that reducing suicide rates requires a collective, concerted effort and most importantly a collaborative approach.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) was established by the HSE in 2005 to oversee the implementation of <i>Reach Out<\/i> our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005 &#8211; 2014.  <i> Reach Out <\/i>is a comprehensive and integrated approach to reducing the loss and suffering from suicide and suicidal behaviours.  It encompasses the promotion, coordination, and support of activities to be implemented at national, regional and community levels.<\/p><p><br \/>  Currently there are many organisations working in the area of mental health promotion and suicide prevention.  Many communities affected by suicide have responded by trying  to find ways of coping with it and preventing it.  Ordinary people  concerned about suicide and people directly affected by suicide have come together with the common goal of dealing with the challenge of suicide and strengthening the community after a suicide has happened.  Suicide prevention is about promoting positive mental health and supporting people to learn a range of positive coping strategies so that they can better deal with difficulties in their lives.  To assist communities, the HSE last year published <i>Suicide Prevention in the Community - A Practical Guide, <\/i>which aims to provide information to help make communities safer from suicide.<\/p><p><br \/>  The NOSP funds a range of agencies providing prevention, intervention, postvention and research services across the voluntary and statutory sector.  It  currently funds 26 agencies with over 40 programmes.  Projects funded in 2012 include: BelongTo, Bodywhys, Console, Samaritans, National Suicide Research Foundation, Spunout, Teenline, Young Social Innovators,  etc.  In 2013, there will be further investment in a range of existing and new initiatives.  The NOSP publishes an Annual Report, which is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, that details its work programme and expenditure for the year.  The latest report published is for 2011.<\/p><p><br \/>  Irrespective of the number of agencies working in this area, it is vital that we ensure that this work is connected\/interlinked and avoids duplication, is evidence and needs based and offers value for money.  In order to get maximum benefit from the investment in suicide prevention and ensure a coordinated response to the needs of those at risk of or affected by suicide, the NOSP will continue to coordinate  the work of the many different voluntary, statutory and non-statutory organisations working in this area.  By promoting cross-organisational collaboration, the development of networks and partnerships, skills sharing and service development, the NOSP hopes to maximise the impact of a suicide prevention and support network in Ireland, to ensure it reaches and responds effectively to people who are vulnerable.  The NOSP is currently working to integrate current programmes so as to reduce duplication within the sector, and provide a strategic framework for the coordination of the extensive range of actions in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WREE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Suicide Bereavement Support","counter":1662,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WREE00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1663,"qnumday":718,"qnumall":"[7285\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WREE00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if she will provide the number of agencies that are working in the area of suicide bereavement care here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1664,"qnumday":720,"qnumall":"[7287\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200072#WREE00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of agencies working in the area of suicide bereavement care which are in receipt of Exchequer funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1665,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 718 and 720 together.<\/p><p>Bereavement support for families and communities is critically important in the aftermath of a death by suicide.

The HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention provides funding to Console to deliver suicide bereavement support services across the country.

Prior to this any surveying for the disease had yielded negative results. Following the finding a major survey was initiated by the Department part of which was a winter survey of all ash plantations of imported stock planted during 2009 &#8211; 2012. This exercise has now been completed.    The plantation survey is ongoing and is now looking at a larger timeframe of plantings. <\/p><p><br \/>  Well over 100 samples were sent for analysis from the winter plantation survey. In total there are currently 26 forestry plantations with imported ash that have tested positive; with trace-forward of the associated trees in the batches this represents over 120 sites. In addition a member of the public reported a suspected garden ash tree and this also tested positive. A further occurrence has been confirmed on ash growing on the surrounds of a farm.  Department officials are also surveying forestry and horticultural nurseries, motorways as well as farm plantings.  There have been positive samples in 14 separate horticultural nurseries and 1 garden centre. In relation to the motorways I can report that 3 sites have been identified as having the disease. <\/p><p>The Department&#8217;s forestry officials are working with the forestry contractors and the owners to remove the ash trees on these 120-  plus sites, under a reconstitution scheme. This scheme is being put in place and its terms and conditions will be available shortly.  An individual Sanitation Action Plan will be put in place for each of the sites affected. This will set out in detail the procedures to be followed at the specified site. It will cover actions such as disposal of infected material and proper hygiene measures etc. <\/p><p>On 26 October legal measures were also introduced to prohibit the importation into Ireland of plant material from ash dieback infected areas.  These measures, introduced by Ministerial Order, took effect immediately. Ireland imported over 200,000 ash plants in 2011.<\/p><p>On 6   November legislation was introduced to restrict the movement of ash wood into the country (in addition to plant material).

The latter regulation, came into effect on 1 July 2009, provides that equine animals registered after that date<b><\/b>  must be identified with a passport and a microchip. <\/p><p>The EU legislation has been transposed into national legislation via S.I. No. 357 of 2011 - European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011 (as amended).  This legislation provides that if an equine animal has not been identified within six months of the date of its birth, or by the 31 December in the year of its birth, whichever date occurs later, then the equine animal cannot be admitted to the food chain. S.I. No 357 of 2011 was amended in September 2012 by S.I. 371 of 2012 in order to strengthen the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of an issuing body for equine passports and prosecutions in relation to equine identification and to make it an offence to forge or tamper with an equine passport.<\/p><p>My Department introduced enhanced<b><\/b>legislation and<b><\/b>  procedures in relation to the registration of horse premises such that, from 1 May 2012, anyone who is the owner\/person in charge of any premises on which horses are kept is required to register the premises with my Department.  Keepers seeking to register equines are required to have a herd number registered with my Department and to keep records of movements on\/off their premises.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department also introduced enhanced procedures for the slaughter of horses in abattoirs in October 2011 and communicated these and the checks required both to its staff and the business operators. These procedures provide that an official veterinarian must be present in a meat plant when slaughtering is taking place. All animals are subject to an antemortem inspection, which includes an identification check, by an official veterinarian prior to slaughter. Where forged or tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, it is Department policy that such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department is developing a central database of horses which will involve migration of selected data from Passport Issuing Organisations to the Department and may include information from records obtained at slaughter plants, knackeries, sales and live exports.  The intention is that this database will be used at abattoirs to verify the authenticity of the passport for the equine presented and to record its date of slaughter. <\/p><p><br \/>  As indicated above, the legislative basis for the identification of equines resides in EU legislation, as transposed into Irish legislation, and it is not open to me unilaterally to apply the EU provisions relating to the identification of bovines to the equidae sector. Apart from this, not all components of the cattle system would be appropriate for equines, not least the requirement to use tags in both ears. However, I will continue to review existing legislation to establish if a need exists to bring forward further provisions to strengthen the traceability system for horses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200073#WRW04300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":1853,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200073#WRW04350"},{"type":"question","counter":1854,"qnumday":580,"qnumall":"[7050\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200073#WRW04400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when an agri environment option scheme payment will be awarded in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry.","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1855,"content":"<p>The person named was approved for participation in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme with effect from the 1 September 2010 and full payments totalling &euro;1,666.66 and &euro;4,999.98 issued in respect of 2010 and 2011 respectively. <\/p><p>  Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue.

Among the key drivers of future beef export performance in these markets will be the general macro-economic environment, the EU demand\/supply balance and exchange rate developments, particularly with regard to the euro vis-&agrave;-vis sterling.<\/p><p><br \/>  The immediate outlook for Irish beef output is that it is forecast to rise by 10% in 2013 as reduced live exports over recent years boost volumes. Global beef supplies are likely to remain stable and, as a result, EU imports are unlikely to increase significantly in 2013. The challenge will be to maintain price levels but continuing tight availability of beef across Europe should help exporters. Concomitant with this broadly positive outlook is a continuing improvement in the positioning of Irish beef exports in key markets with over 60% of export volumes now destined for the higher value standard retail, premium food service, and retail or quick service sectors. <\/p><p>Exploiting the strong sustainability credentials of the grass-fed beef will be a key element in maintaining and expanding markets for the Irish beef industry up to 2015. In this context, the 32,000<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>members of the Bord Bia Beef Quality Assurance (QA) Scheme are committed to actively measuring and reducing their carbon emissions. This is the only QA programme in the world that has an environmental element operating on a national basis. This important initiative will give Irish beef exports a genuine competitive advantage in securing premium product status in fiercely competitive foreign markets. Innovative product offerings supported by appropriate marketing are the best means of increasing market returns and viability across the supply chain.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, the leading Irish beef processing companies have also embraced the concept of sustainability under Origin Green. This is a comprehensive national sustainability development programme, the first of its kind in the world, designed by Bord Bia to assist Ireland to become known as the optimum source of sustainably produced food and drink. Industry recruitment commenced in June 2012 and to date a total of 188 companies have signed up to the programme. Central to the Origin Green concept is a sustainability charter that will commit Ireland&#8217;s agri-food industry, including beef processors, to engage directly and robustly with the challenges of sustainable production: reducing energy inputs, minimizing their overall carbon footprint and lessening their impact on the environment.<\/p><p><br \/>  Notwithstanding the fact that most Irish beef exports go to other EU member states, it is always beneficial to have a wide range of market outlets available for our beef products. My Department will be working &#8211; in collaboration with the industry, Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade &#8211; to secure access to more third country outlets for Irish beef over the next three years. At present, Irish beef enjoys access to markets in Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Russia, Hong Kong and Singapore.<\/p><p><br \/>  I have been assiduous in nurturing relationships in new and growing markets in order to build confidence in Irish production and control systems which will underpin long-term trading relationships in the future. As part of that effort, I headed trade missions last year to China and the USA, during which I raised the subject of access for Irish beef with my ministerial counterparts. Apart from China and the US, other targeted markets for Irish beef access include Japan and Korea as well as North African and Middle Eastern countries. My Department is engaging closely with the authorities in those countries to gain access for Irish beef products.

During 2012 output, prices and export values continued the growth seen in recent years, growing by 2%, 10% and 16% respectively. <\/p><p><br \/>  Currently pig prices are over 15% ahead of the same week last year. This equates to almost 23c\/kg. When compared to the same week in 2010, prices have risen by over 46\/c per kilo, or more than 38%.<\/p><p><br \/>  The &#8216;<i>Food Harvest 2020 Report<\/i>  &#8217;, published in July 2010, sets out the vision for the future of the food industry including the pig sector and targets a 50% increase in the value of output by 2020.  My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally. Given that cereals account for up to 75% of pig feed, the impact of significant increases in cereal prices in recent years on the pig sector has been considerable.  While there has been some easing of soya prices in recent months thus ameliorating some of the consequences, they continue to remain significantly above historic averages. The weather affected harvests with drought in the USA and the Black Sea region leading to lower output and consequent upward pressure on prices.<\/p><p><br \/>  Following rebuilding and recovery efforts in recent years the future for the Irish pig sector remains challenging. Notwithstanding recent cereal price reductions, input prices are forecast to remain above long-term averages for the foreseeable future. In addition, difficulties in the non-feed elements of production such as credit availability, energy costs and compliance with the EU Loose Sow Housing Directive which came into force in January 2013 together with the decline in the size of the breeding herd pose significant challenges to producers. EU output is forecast to decline by 2-3% in 2013 which conversely will offer increased opportunities to Irish producers. However, the ongoing issues referred to above together with the near 7% decline in the Irish breeding herd in 2012, may limit Irish producers&#8217; scope to avail of these openings.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to the Loose Sow Housing Directive, an on-farm investment aid scheme (TAMS) &#8211; the Sow Housing Welfare Scheme was introduced under Ireland&#8217;s Rural Development Programme 2007 &#8211; 2013, to facilitate producer compliance with the requirements. The scheme has been enhanced and extended on a number of occasions. While the majority of producers have worked extremely hard to achieve compliance, my Department became aware that a small number of producers had experienced difficulties with planning permission. With this in mind, I recently announced a further extension in the deadline for grant applications until 2 April 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  I have provided a total of &#8364;16 million for this scheme. I should add that this funding is in addition to earlier Sow Welfare Schemes which delivered over &#8364;6 million to successful applicants. <\/p><p><br \/>  With regard to financial support available to the pig industry, Enterprise Ireland operates various programmes relating to company development. Included among these are Research and Development and Innovation Funding. Through a mix of funding, advice and expertise, Enterprise Ireland works with companies planning or engaging in R&amp;D. Assistance for product development is also available through the Teagasc National Food Centre in Ashtown, Dublin 15. A number of businesses within the pig sector have availed of these programmes in recent years.<\/p><p><br \/>  Teagasc, through its Moorepark pig research facility and the provision of FETAC courses in pig production and benchmarking pig herd performance, plays a critically important role in improving productive capacity at farm level. Teagasc have also circulated pig producers with a number of the options available to them to reduce feed costs and improve feed efficiency. <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, Teagasc continues on an ongoing basis to develop enhanced systems of research, technical assistance and knowledge transfer in order to assist the pig sector.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In so far as international trade in Irish pigmeat is concerned, my Department has been extremely active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long term trading relationships in the future. <\/p><p><br \/>  And of course Bord Bia continues, through its promotional activities, and through the pigmeat quality assurance scheme, to help consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and international markets. This is proving particularly successful in international markets, primarily Russia and China where the value of Irish pigmeat exports grew to over &#8364;110 million in 2012. <\/p><p><br \/>  It is important to remember that pigmeat remains the most consumed meat worldwide and this will continue to present opportunities for Irish producers, given our self-sufficiency. In addition, the measures outlined above, together with the progress made in the last few years in establishing and consolidating a presence in important international markets will better position Irish producers to take advantage of growing demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200074#WRX02900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare Issues","counter":1905,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200074#WRX02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1906,"qnumday":596,"qnumall":"[7372\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200074#WRX03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which the farming community has been in a position to comply with requirements arising from animal welfare requirements in the context of the provision of improved animal housing arrangements; if adequate resources have been made available by the lending institutions to meet such requirements, if any outstanding issues remain; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1907,"content":"<p>New EU Animal Welfare rules setting down new standards in relation to the housing of sows came into force on 1 January 2013.

The EU will prepare for this by facilitating discussion and organising a conference under the auspices of DG-Agri in Autumn 2013.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Family farming has always been the main form of farming in Ireland.  The key difficulties that I have seen are the lack of succession planning and the lack of availability of farm land for new entrants.  To meet these challenges new taxation measures were introduced in the last two budgets aimed at improving land mobility and farm consolidation, and encouraging transfers to younger, more progressive farmers.  Stamp duty on agricultural land was reduced from 6% to 2%.  In addition, half the rate (1%) is now applicable on transfers to close relatives until the end of 2014. This change substantially reduced the stamp duty payable on transfers of farm land by gift or by sale. The measure promotes inter-generational transfer, as the cost of lifetime transfer to transferees who do not qualify for the young trained farmer stamp duty relief has been reduced considerably.<\/p><p><br \/>  Budget 2012 also restructured the retirement relief available on Capital Gains Tax in order to incentivise the earlier transfer of farm assets to the next generation, and to encourage the sale of land by those farmers with no successors. <\/p><p><br \/>  Retirement relief was restructured in order to encourage farmers around the normal retirement age, who have successors, to transfer their land and holdings to young, innovative, ambitious, prospective farmers. This measure encourages an improvement in the age profile of farmers, and should ensure that farmland is put to more productive use.<\/p><p><br \/>  It should be noted that there has been no change to the very important 90% agricultural relief on Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT). This means that farms worth up to &#8364;2.5 million will continue to be fully exempt from CAT with regard to transfers to a child.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am also happy that the new restructuring relief has been announced in the 2013 budget.  This is the result of detailed work which analysed the reasons why the old consolidation relief was not working.  I am confident that the new relief in relation to Capital Gains Taxes, once State Aid approval has been received, will be more effective, especially given that Stamp Duty rates have been reduced.  Re-structuring is essential for us to meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  We need to use land more productively and encourage more young farmers to make the best use of the land.

Brussels, 12\/10\/2011.<sup>1]<\/sup>.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland has a very low level of land sales, with most land staying within the same family for generations. Only 0.4% of land changes hand in any given year.  Young farmers that want to expand need to be able to access land.  According to the latest census of agriculture the average farm has 3.8 land parcels.  This means that our farmers are wasting time and diesel driving between plots of land, increasing the stress and the risk of accidents.  Young farmers will now have an opportunity to consolidate their holdings and increase efficiency.  <\/p><p><br \/>  I also believe that family farms are the places where young people can learn the required skills in partnership with parents and other family members.  Indeed Irish farming greatly benefits from the pooling of skills and knowledge of all family members and in this regard I would strongly encourage greater participation by women in farm decision making and management.  I am confident that providing an additional incentive to farm partnership formation will encourage farmers to consider more closely the benefits of farm partnerships to their farming business and in providing a better work-life balance. <\/p><p><br \/>  Encouraging farm partnerships will also support the dairy herd expansion required over the coming years, enabling Irish farmers to avail of the opportunity presented by the abolition of EU milk quotas in March 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200074#WRX03500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Safety Standards Regulation","counter":1914,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200074#WRX03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1915,"qnumday":599,"qnumall":"[7375\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200074#WRX03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the degree to which he and his Department expects to be in a position to counter any negativity arising from recent traceability or quality breakdowns with particular reference to quality assurance on worldwide markets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1916,"content":"<p>Following the findings of the FSAI Survey on the authenticity of meat products (published on January 15), which disclosed the presence of horse meat in burgers and the identification in the follow up investigation of the source, the problem has developed into a pan European investigation of food fraud involving a range of meat products and traders\/food business operators.<\/p><p>  My aim throughout this situation has been to ensure that everything possible is done to fully restore consumer confidence in the Irish meat sector. I asked Bord Bia to maintain constant contact with our export markets to reassure international buyers that there is no food safety issue involved and that the issue has been dealt with swiftly and appropriately by the Irish authorities. Initial market impact at consumer level (weekend of Jan 20th  ) indicated that the controversy was largely confined within the UK and Irish markets, where the affected products were on sale and taken off the shelf, where the media coverage has been intense and consumer awareness very high. The research indicated that consumers were ring-fencing the problem to this particular segment of the market, and not extending or generalising it to the wider industry. The processed meat sector is a relatively limited segment of the total Irish meat market and is not otherwise impacting on Irish food exports. Beyond these markets, media coverage, interest and awareness has been limited and no concerns whatever have been reported to Bord Bia by trade buyers or consumers.

A key objective is the avoidance of very early closure of fisheries through rapid exhaustion of quota. Under the current arrangements, fishing industry representatives are consulted formally through the Whitefish Quota Management Advisory Committee on a monthly basis and their views are taken into account as far as possible in the determination of monthly regimes for particular stocks.

Most of the fisheries resource within the area comes under the remit of the EUs Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). In June 2012, the European Commission reported that fish stocks in European waters are improving (EC COM(2012) 278 final). The proportion of overfished stocks in the Atlantic declined from around 90% of all stocks between 2005-2009 to 47% in 2012. Several stocks in the west of Scotland, Irish Sea and Celtic sea have suffered from being over fished in the past and remain at relatively low levels (i.e. Cod in Divisions VIa and VIIa, Sole in Division VIIa, Whiting in Divisions VIa and VIIa). Scientific advice is that exploitation rates of these depleted stocks appears to remain high in most cases despite significant reductions in fishing effort over the last decade (EC COM(2012) 278. <\/p><p>  The Marine Institute has given a workable definition to sustainable fisheries ie  when a fishery  can be &lsquo;conducted over the long term at an acceptable level of biological and economic productivity, without leading to ecological changes that exclude options for future generations&rsquo;. Optimum levels of biological and economic productivity are in part management decisions, but though considerable progress has been made in recent years in terms of addressing sustainability issues it is clear that for many stocks there is still room for further improvement. The European Union and Member States have committed themselves to reach the objectives of fishing at MSY by 2015 where possible. <\/p><p>  Reform of the CFP itself which is currently under discussion at EU level will help to address many of the key long term fisheries sustainability issues. The advancement of this reform agenda  has been prioritised by the Irish EU Presidency.   Current proposals for CFP reform encompass a range of innovative proposals for measures to eliminate the practice of  discards, achieving appropriate maximum long term sustainable yields (MSYs) and the introduction of effective fair transparent regionalisation mechanisms.  It is my belief that the introduction and implementation of these necessary and timely reforms (which must be adopted under co-decision jointly by the EU Fisheries Council and the EU Parliament) will support the ongoing development of a sustainable and thriving Irish and European fishing industry for the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200075#WRY00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1936,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200075#WRY00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1937,"qnumday":606,"qnumall":"[7382\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200075#WRY00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the cost incurred by his Department for assessing means of individual citizens for any reason on an annual basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1938,"content":"<p>My Department does not assess the means of individual citizens and as such does not incur any associated costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200075#WRY00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dairy Equipment Scheme Appeals","counter":1939,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200075#WRY00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1940,"qnumday":607,"qnumall":"[7397\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200075#WRY00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide an update on the outstanding appeal payment in resect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1941,"content":"<p>The person concerned is an applicant for grant-aid under the TAMS Dairy Equipment Scheme.

However, there was a recognition at the time of the difficulties of regulating the childminding sector, given its scale and the strong view that women should not be subject to regulation if they minded a small number of additional children.  As a result, the majority of childminders are exempt from the Regulations currently in place.<\/p><p>  The 2000 Expert Working Group on Childcare set out a plan for integrating the various strands of child care and education, including childminding.  It made a number of recommendations aimed at overcoming the barriers preventing childminders from moving into the formal economy, most of which have been implemented.  These included the introduction of a system for voluntary notification of childminders, and the introduction of Childcare Services Relief, which allows a voluntarily-notified childminder to mind up to three children without paying tax on the earnings and to make a PRSI contribution.<\/p><p>  In 2002, the Health Service Executive (HSE) agreed to fund a Childminding Advisory Officer post in each county, who would work with the 33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) funded under the Childcare Programme, implemented by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The role included notifying childminders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the voluntary notification system which was being developed by the CCCs.<\/p><p>  While Childminding Advisory Officers were established in most county areas, this was not always the case and they were not always located with the local CCC.  Despite their presence and the additional supports including training, a small capital grant scheme and the introduction of a tax relief for childminding in 2006, the increase in the number of voluntarily-notified childminders since 2004, when the number was 500, has been relatively small and levelled off at 1,250.<\/p><p>  In recent years, HSE funding for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts has gradually decreased, and is no longer in place in some areas.  I understand that this is due to pressure on HSE resources and the need to prioritise funding to other areas of front-line services.  While this is not a welcome development, I would point to the fact that the CCCs are now well-established and effective bodies at local level, and that supporting the childminding sector is an integral part of their work.  As a result, childminders continue to have access to support, training and advice.<\/p><p>  My Department provides annual funding to each CCC to enable them to support and advise all childcare providers at local level.  In 2012, the total amount allocated to the CCCs was &euro;11.3m.  In addition, in 2012 my Department provided &euro;220,000 to the CCCs for Childminding Development Grants.  My Department also provides annual funding, totalling &euro;2.85m in 2012, to seven National Voluntary Childcare Organisations to provide support at a local level to their members.  This included &euro;358,000 for Childminding Ireland, the representative body for childminders.<\/p><p>  My Department has commenced work on Ireland's first Early Years Strategy.  One of the policy issues which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the Early Years Strategy is the development of the childminding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for the under-one age group.<\/p><p>  Under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006, services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the HSE.   Childminders taking care of not more than three pre-school children from different families are not covered by the Regulations and are not required to notify.   Decisions on how best to regulate and support the childminding sector will continue to form part of the ongoing work on the Early Years Strategy.<\/p><p>  As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the Child Care Regulations set the minimum standards which services are legally required to comply with.  However, my Department is pro-active in monitoring, promoting and developing the highest standards of care and education throughout the sector, including the regulatory environment, given the important role which these services play in this crucial phase of children&rsquo;s lives.<\/p><p>The Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which I published in 2011, provides clarity and guidance for individuals and organisations in identifying and responding appropriately to child abuse and neglect. It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation. The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First.  I published the Heads of the Children First Bill   in April 2012. The purpose of publishing the Heads was to allow for a full consultation at an early stage on developing the Bill. <\/p><p>  I asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to consider the Heads of the Children First Bill and make recommendations.

I met with the Board of the VHI on 19 December last and with the Chair and CEO last month to voice my concerns and to emphasise the absolute need for VHI to manage its costs.  Given VHI&rsquo;s very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs and to address aggressively the base cost of procedures including professional fees.  I have consistently urged the VHI and all health insurers to do everything possible to keep down the cost of health insurance and I am determined to address costs in the sector, in the interests of consumers.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to keeping down the cost of health insurance so that it is affordable for as many people as possible and remains committed to protecting community rating, whereby everyone pays the same price for the same health insurance product, irrespective of age or health status.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2012 introduced a new permanent Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) for the private health insurance market with effect from 1 January 2013.   An effective and robust RES is required  in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.   The Scheme is also of benefit to insurers with increased adverse risks, in particular, the VHI.<\/p><p>  My officials have had a number of discussions with VHI officials to assist them in understanding the divergence between their calculation of the effectiveness of the new RES  and that of my Department. My Department has also conferred with its actuarial advisors who have concluded that the calculation methodology used by VHI understates the effectiveness of the scheme. In addition, the Health Insurance Authority ( HIA) , the industry regulator, has confirmed, based on market average claim costs for prescribed benefits, that the 2013 scheme compensates for 75% of the higher claims costs for those aged in their seventies and compensates for 83% of the higher claims costs for those aged in their eighties. The 2013 scheme has also provided for a measure of health status whereby an amount of &euro;75 per night will be payable from the Risk Equalisation Fund in respect of each hospital stay involving an overnight stay in a hospital bed in private hospital accommodation, including in a designated private bed in a publicly funded hospital.  This measure benefits each insurer who pays for a customer to use an overnight hospital bed and also benefits VHI to a significant level given its market share and customer profile.<\/p><p>  I should also point out that compensation levels under risk equalisation are based on average claims for the market as a whole rather than on the claims for any particular insurer such as VHI.  To do otherwise might be seen as providing an incentive for inefficiencies in claims cost management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200075#WRY03900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1990,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200075#WRY03950"},{"type":"question","counter":1991,"qnumday":624,"qnumall":"[6581\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200075#WRY04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made to date in implementing a Vision for Change; the reason there is a priority to review the Mental Health Act 2001 prior to replacing the Vision for Change implementation expert group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1014","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1992,"content":"<p>Implementation of <i>A Vision for Change<\/i> (AVFC) and the reform of our mental health services is a priority for this Government.  plementation of AVFC has been slower than originally expected.

While a limited review was conducted in 2007, a more comprehensive review is required now as Part Two of the Act only commenced in November 2006.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to review the Mental Health Act 2001 and in June 2011, I appointed a Steering Group to undertake the first phase of the review.  The terms of reference for the initial phase of the review required the Steering Group to consider &#8220;<i>the extent to which the recommendations of A Vision for Change could or should be underpinned by legislation&#8221;.  <\/i>  This was done on the basis that the Mental Health Act 2001 which was enacted five years before the publication of AVFC does not reflect the significant changes in thinking about the delivery of mental health services that have taken place in the last ten years, such as the shift to community based services, the adoption of a recovery approach in every aspect of service delivery and the involvement of service users as partners in their own care and in the development of the service.  <\/p><p><br \/>  With the direct connection between the Mental Health Act and <i>A Vision for Change<\/i>, it makes sense that we finalise our work on the review of the Act before considering a review of <i>Vision.<\/i>   I expect that the review of the Act will be completed and presented to me in quarter two of this year.  In the interim, the HSE continues to implement <i>A Vision for Change<\/i>   with substantial additional funding provided in  2012 and 2013, and reports on this on a monthly basis, through the HSE National Service Plan. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200075#WRY04100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":1993,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200075#WRY04150"},{"type":"question","counter":1994,"qnumday":625,"qnumall":"[6597\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200075#WRY04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if persons with chronic asthma will be issued with a medical card on health grounds;

Under UHI, everyone will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Department is preparing a White Paper on Universal Health Insurance which will provide further detail on the UHI model for Ireland in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance. The work involved is both complex and technical, necessitating significant research and financial modelling to support analysis and costing of different design options.  This, in turn, demands a wide-range of specialised expertise. The Department is engaged in a process to ensure the provision of this expertise to feed into work on the preparation of the White Paper during 2013.  The White Paper will be published as early as possible within the Government&#8217;s term of office.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In advance of the White Paper, my Department has produced a Preliminary Paper on UHI, which I intend to publish shortly. <\/p><p>The reform programme is a major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing over a number of years. The Programme for Government acknowledges that full implementation of UHI will take some time to achieve. <i>Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015 <\/i>  highlights the importance of a step-by-step evidence-based approach to achieving an effective, equitable and efficient system and sets out key actions to systematically deliver on reform.

These Programmes have three main objectives &ndash; to improve the quality of care, to improve access and to improve cost-effectiveness.  Their primary aim is to modernise the way hospital services are provided across a wide range of clinical areas.  This is being done through standardising access to and delivery of high quality, safe and efficient hospital services and maximising linkages to primary care and other community services.  Cork and Beaumont are two of six regional centres which have been identified for the provision of specialist epilepsy services under the Clinical Care Programme for Epilepsy.  It is intended that services will be provided by a team of nurses and consultant neurologists working as a virtual national network supporting all acute and primary care locations.  Rapid Access Clinics (separate to the Epilepsy Monitoring Units) have been developed at four of centres so far and 10.5 (WTE) Advanced Nurse Practitioners have been recruited to lead these clinics, so that a total of 12 Advanced Nurse Practitioners are now in place across the four centres.   When the Epilepsy Monitoring Units in CUH and Beaumont are open, they will increase pre-surgical evaluation capacity.  Monitoring is required for the most vulnerable patients with the worst effects of epilepsy and their development is therefore a priority for the Programme.  Patients at these units will require 24\/7 care.  The staffing requirements to enable the units to be safely opened have been identified.<\/p><p>  With regard to recruitment, the Government has decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced to meet its fiscal and budgetary targets.  The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction.  However, the HSE can make staff appointments once it remains within its overall employment ceiling and has the financial resources to do so.  I understand that the normal processes will apply to the HSE&rsquo;s decisions regarding the recruitment of the required staff in CUH and Beaumont.  With regard to Beaumont, the HSE has advised that Beaumont Hospital and the HSE are working jointly to fill the posts necessary to support service development.  I am advised that the staffing required for the unit includes five staff nurses, one consultant neurophysiologist and three technicians.  Of these, three staff nurse posts and one technician post remain to be recruited.  I am informed that this is being prioritised.  The recruitment of nursing personnel is a key element to facilitate phased opening of the unit as nursing staff come into post.  With regard to Cork, the HSE has advised that the Service Plan for 2013 for CUH is being drawn up currently and will be finalised in the coming weeks, and that the provision of additional staff for the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit is being considered as part of that process. <\/p><p>  With regard to the issue of exemption from generic substitution of anti-epileptic drugs, under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill, the Irish Medicines Board has statutory responsibility for establishing and publishing a List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products.  In making a decision to add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the board is obliged to have regard to the criteria set out in the Bill.  These criteria fully reflect the recommendations set out in the Joint Department of Health\/HSE report &quot;Proposed Model of Reference Pricing and Generic Substitution&quot; (the Moran Report, 2010) regarding criteria for interchangeability.  To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted. I am satisfied that these provisions address the concerns raised.  I met the Irish Epilepsy Association in January and explained this position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200077#WRAA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":2047,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200077#WRAA01450"},{"type":"question","counter":2048,"qnumday":642,"qnumall":"[6732\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200077#WRAA01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a person (details supplied) suffering from multiple sclerosis, whose condition is deteriorating;

Progress in a number of key areas includes a 10% increase in the number of new cases seen by CAMHS for the period October 2011 &#8211; September 2012,  and a continued reduction in the number of children and adolescents admitted to adult units.<\/p><p><br \/>  As the issue raised by the Deputy relates to a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply in respect of the detailed information sought.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200079#WRCC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccine Damage Compensation","counter":2136,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200079#WRCC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":2137,"qnumday":675,"qnumall":"[7001\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200079#WRCC01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a vaccine damage compensation scheme in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2138,"content":"<p>The issues contained in the Report of the Vaccine Damage Steering Group are complex.

The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has developed key performance indicators (KPIs) for pre-hospital emergency care, which classify 999 emergency calls by clinical status.

The target times for responding to Echo and Delta calls are 7 minutes 59 seconds by a first responder (a person trained in minimum basic life support and use of a defibrillator) and 18 minutes 59 seconds for a patient-carrying vehicle.

The Involuntary admission of persons to a psychiatric hospital or unit in the 1950's and 1960's was governed by the 1945 Mental Treatment Act. The 1945 Act allowed for the admission and detention without their consent, of a person as a  'temporary patient' or a 'person of unsound mind'  following an application received and accompanied by a medical certificate, signed by a doctor and on foot of a reception order signed by a consultant psychiatrist. <\/p><p>  There were no provisions in the 1945 Act for an automatic right of appeal to an independent judicial body against a person's involuntary detention in a psychiatric hospital. However, the Act did provide patients with the right to write a letter to the Minister for Health &amp; Children, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals or the President of the High Court. It also required the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, in the course of his inspections, to visit any patient &quot;the propriety of whose detention he had reason to doubt&quot;.<\/p><p>  The Mental Health 2001 Act significantly modernised procedures relating to involuntary admission by establishing for the first time independent Mental Health Tribunals which review, and affirm or revoke detention orders.

There is not a community in Ireland that has not been affected by suicide.  We know that reducing suicide rates requires a collective, concerted effort and most importantly a collaborative approach.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) was established by the HSE in 2005 to oversee the implementation of <i>Reach Out<\/i> our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005 &#8211; 2014.  <i> Reach Out <\/i>is a comprehensive and integrated approach to reducing the loss and suffering from suicide and suicidal behaviours.  It encompasses the promotion, coordination, and support of activities to be implemented at national, regional and community levels.<\/p><p><br \/>  Currently there are many organisations working in the area of mental health promotion and suicide prevention.  Many communities affected by suicide have responded by trying  to find ways of coping with it and preventing it.  Ordinary people  concerned about suicide and people directly affected by suicide have come together with the common goal of dealing with the challenge of suicide and strengthening the community after a suicide has happened.  Suicide prevention is about promoting positive mental health and supporting people to learn a range of positive coping strategies so that they can better deal with difficulties in their lives.  To assist communities, the HSE last year published <i>Suicide Prevention in the Community - A Practical Guide, <\/i>which aims to provide information to help make communities safer from suicide.<\/p><p><br \/>  The NOSP funds a range of agencies providing prevention, intervention, postvention and research services across the voluntary and statutory sector.  It  currently funds 26 agencies with over 40 programmes.  Projects funded in 2012 include: BelongTo, Bodywhys, Console, Samaritans, National Suicide Research Foundation, Spunout, Teenline, Young Social Innovators,  etc.  In 2013, there will be further investment in a range of existing and new initiatives.  The NOSP publishes an Annual Report, which is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, that details its work programme and expenditure for the year.  The latest report published is for 2011.<\/p><p><br \/>  Irrespective of the number of agencies working in this area, it is vital that we ensure that this work is connected\/interlinked and avoids duplication, is evidence and needs based and offers value for money.  In order to get maximum benefit from the investment in suicide prevention and ensure a coordinated response to the needs of those at risk of or affected by suicide, the NOSP will continue to coordinate  the work of the many different voluntary, statutory and non-statutory organisations working in this area.  By promoting cross-organisational collaboration, the development of networks and partnerships, skills sharing and service development, the NOSP hopes to maximise the impact of a suicide prevention and support network in Ireland, to ensure it reaches and responds effectively to people who are vulnerable.  The NOSP is currently working to integrate current programmes so as to reduce duplication within the sector, and provide a strategic framework for the coordination of the extensive range of actions in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200081#WREE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Suicide Bereavement Support","counter":2257,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200081#WREE00550"},{"type":"question","counter":2258,"qnumday":718,"qnumall":"[7285\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200081#WREE00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if she will provide the number of agencies that are working in the area of suicide bereavement care here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2259,"qnumday":720,"qnumall":"[7287\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021200081#WREE00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of agencies working in the area of suicide bereavement care which are in receipt of Exchequer funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2260,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 718 and 720 together.<\/p><p>Bereavement support for families and communities is critically important in the aftermath of a death by suicide.
