Anyone who has followed the debate with regard to the Minister's blatant misuse of privileged information would understand that no one in their right mind could stand over his actions, and it is beyond me how the Government can do that.  No one believes his excuses or his reasoning, and many unanswered questions remain.<\/p><p>On 27 February, this House had what I felt was a very good debate on policing, this Minister's mishandling of law and order, the fact that he has presided over the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but has lost the confidence of the rank and file garda&iacute;, closed more than 140 barracks and under-resourced the garda&iacute;.  We gave over a week's notice of that debate, as we are required to do, but on 27 February the Minister decided not to show up in the Seanad to take the debate.  I said on the day that that was probably the starkest example of this man's arrogance and disdain for people who do not share his views.<\/p><p>In that debate I said I would submit a freedom of information request for the Minister's diary, which I did and which I have in my hand.  On 27 February, when he could not be bothered showing up for a two hour debate here in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the Minister spent 45 minutes meeting with representatives of Responsible Retailing of Alcohol in Ireland.  He then met with his private spin doctor, Mr. Tom Fabozzi, for another half an hour while our debate was ongoing.<\/p> <p>He was not on Government business or doing any bilateral meetings because of the European Presidency.  He did not meet anyone of any note who in my view would have excused him from coming here to take a motion of no confidence in himself.  He did not even stand up for himself and his record and answer the points here.  I have a copy of his diary for circulation and it is not the most extensive ministerial diary I have ever seen.  There is no excuse for the Minister not being in the House on this particular day.  Will the Leader seek from the Minister, Deputy Shatter,  the reasons he did not see fit to come to the House on 27 February to answer a Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members' motion?

It was very good use of the Chamber.  The hearings were comprehensive.  I attended as a substitute member for most of the hearings, and many colleagues were also in attendance.  We had very constructive engagement on the heads and scheme of the protection of life during pregnancy Bill.  We heard very compelling arguments from the legal and medical experts who gave of their time voluntarily to give us the benefit of their expertise.  We should all acknowledge this and how much it is appreciated.  I look forward to the debate on the Bill which we are likely to have before the end of the session.  I look forward to changes being made, in particular to head 19 on the criminalisation of those who seek to procure termination of pregnancy in the State.  Concerns were expressed by people on both sides of the argument and people of various views about the level of the penalty and the way in which pregnant women and girls would be criminalised.  We may see engagement on this.<\/p><p>I welcome the publication of the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, proposes to introduce a new jobseekers' transition scheme which will be a progressive scheme to deal clearly with concerns expressed in the House during debates on social protection about changes to the lone parent's allowance which disadvantage recipients.  The new scheme is extremely welcome.  It will exempt lone parents from the full rigours of the requirements to be available for full-time work which apply to those seeking jobseeker's allowance but will allow lone parents access activation plans for return to education, upskilling and training.  It recognises that many lone parents are not in a position to seek full-time work but would seek part-time work.  It is a very progressive scheme and is welcome.  I look forward to debating it in the House.<\/p><p>With regard to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, I am one of the many people who thinks he has questions to answer on the use of information concerning Deputy Wallace.  I absolutely agree with this.  I am glad questions were put to him in the other House yesterday and that he made a statement.  I also understand Deputy Wallace has made an application for further investigation to the Standards in Public Office Commission, and this is appropriate and correct.

This is an extremely serious report of approximately 40,000 words and 152 detailed footnotes and references and it requires a response from us.  I will give the House a flavour of it presently.  The Fiscal Advisory Council should examine the issues involved such as how corporations are taxed.  There is a view in economics that too many tax lawyers and accountants are involved, that they are a dead weight loss, and what is required is a simple corporate tax system with a low rate across the board and no deductions or allowances.  We have developed a tax lawyer and accountant industry which does not produce anything.  There were some elements of this in the Finance Bill we considered.  The Revenue Commissioners should respond to the issues also.<\/p><p>The evidence given to the US authorities was from Apple executives who are named in the report.  They stated they have negotiated a special corporate tax rate of less than 2%.  Yesterday, the eminent economist Colm McCarthy stated we do not do this and asked where the idea came from, but somebody from the Apple Corporation stated it in evidence to the US authorities.  This must be dealt with in a way which goes beyond soundbites.  In three years Apple Operations International reported a net income of &euro;30 billion but declined to declare any tax of residence.  These hidden corporations are headquartered in Apple in Cork which claims to have negotiated a 2% rate with the Irish Government.  It is quite damaging.  Apple Operations International has the same mailing address as several other Apple affiliates in Cork, has no physical presence in any other country and did not pay any taxes.  There is sizeable evidence of international tax evasion which requires a response from the Revenue Commissioners.  It is necessary to confirm this 2% rate does not exist.  It may have been adduced in evidence in the United States to get Apple off the hook, but we cannot have a tax system where individuals or corporations negotiate their own rates.  Rather than soundbites, it requires a considered response from the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for Finance.  The wider issues, such as what principles should inform the taxation of corporations, should be referred to the Fiscal Advisory Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200003#B02300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1369215000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>With regard to corporate taxation, this morning I heard Barry O'Leary of the IDA on the radio explaining clearly there are no special tax rates in this country for any individual.  Tax rates are set on a statutory basis and the Revenue Commissioners follow these guidelines.  Our corporation tax rate is 12.5% and we have agreements with 69 countries on taxation measures.  Everybody must be careful about soundbites in this area because it is a serious situation.  Apple employs 3,500 people in Cork and many other companies also have large employment bases here.  It is a complex issue and a soundbite will not provide an answer.  From having also heard the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on the radio, it is clear there are no special tax rates for any individual company or corporation in the country and our corporation tax rate is 12.5%.  This is the message we should get out there clearly.  Individuals and companies are taxed on income and it depends on what the amount of income is.  Corporation tax is applied to a certain amount of income.  There may be intellectual property based overseas, and this is a different issue for different companies.<\/p> <p>The House should send the clear message that there are no special tax rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200003#B02400","speaker":"1114","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369215600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200004#C00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1369215600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I wish to raise a separate issue.

I attempted to raise this at the convention forum which decided, democratically, it did not wish to accept it, after a series of very heavy interventions from the platform.  If the forum cannot discuss us we should discuss it and the deliberate exclusion of the subject of the Seanad from the convention, in spite of the clear wish of the vast majority of Members that it should be discussed.  The delegates believe it is not possible.  We should discuss this exclusion because what we are talking about is the abolition of the Oireachtas.  Once the Seanad is abolished the Oireachtas will be gone as we know it and will effectively be the D&aacute;il alone, which is terribly dangerous.  President Mugabe's first step when he took over in Zimbabwe was to abolish its Senate.<\/p><p>During the very brief debate that took place we were asked why we had never reformed ourselves.  I can tell the Irish public why we never did so.  I have been a Member of this House for 26 years.  Every time there was a report on reform of the Seanad - including an all-party agreed report, tabled by me, as Members will remember - it was voted down on the instructions of the incumbent Government.  The Government deliberately prevented the Seanad from reforming itself.  It did not want it reformed and now it is holding us up.  It targeted the university seats and even though it got a referendum through some 27, 28 or 29 years ago, which would have democratised further the only democratic element, namely, the university seats, it has never acted to do this.  The Government does not want a reformed Seanad.  <\/p><p>However, as a result of the Bill passed in this House, thanks to the bravery of Members on the other side, for which I compliment them, we now have a clear choice between abolition or reform.  This is an extremely important matter, and particularly so because of this Bill, the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Bill.  Under the Bill, the Government will take to itself, via D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the right to impeach the President and to bring him or her before a committee of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann alone and dismiss him or her if it feels like it.

Israel has an organisation that sponsors soccer between Israelis and Arabs, and the competition has been going since 1924 and particularly since 1997.  The competition last week was threatened by Fatah in Palestine, as death threats were made against any Arab people who played in the soccer match.

In my book it is simple.  If corporation tax is set at 12.5%, we should collect that amount; it should be no more or less.  We should collect what we set out to collect and if that is not being done, the reasons should be outlined.  I listened this morning to the chief executive of IDA Ireland on \"Morning Ireland\" and I was not convinced by his answer that the rate set out is being paid in all cases in this country.

I refer to Ireland's educated workforce, proximity to Europe and advantageous location even when it comes to the Middle East and the rest of the world.  It is not only on tax grounds that we compete and we need to remember that.  Given that there are so many multinationals here creating employment, there is no benefit in us bashing our tax system, which has been a reason, but not the only one, to get investment here.

Both the national movement for Home Rule and the resistance campaign in Ulster made preparations for armed action with the founding of the Ulster Volunteer Force, UVF, in January and the Irish Volunteers in November.  Between those events, the desperation of workers in Dublin drove them to action that was met with determined suppression.  Alongside that, the votes for women campaign continued with protests and demonstrations.  Despite the excited condition, one could ask whether anyone could have anticipated how all those issues would be overwhelmed in the next fateful years.<\/p><p>  It was with the intention of building an affinity with these troubled times that <i>Century Ireland<\/i> was launched this month.  Supported by my Department, this fortnightly online newspaper is produced in a partnership with Boston College and RTE.  At the core of <i>Century Ireland<\/i> is a collaborative partnership between the major cultural and educational institutions in Ireland.  By working so fruitfully together, the various partners are making a range of rarely or never seen material available that will bring the events of a century ago to life.  It will present as a continuing stream the news of the centenary period, reporting the headline stories and the off-beat items that sensitise us to the changed times.<\/p><p>  The reporting will be supported by a wealth of visual, archival and contextual material to facilitate an understanding of the complexities of Irish life in the years between 1912 and 1923.  Change sometimes arrives slowly and without being noticed.  <i>Century Ireland<\/i> will make a special effort to address the less visible but no less significant developments in society.  I hope the newspaper will attract a wide readership throughout Ireland and abroad, stimulating interest in the period and encouraging all to join in the commemorations.  I was informed by RTE that circulation had reached almost 100,000 in the first week.  I am particularly pleased with the use of modern technologies to bring our history to new audiences, especially young people and those without ready access to attend the special presentations at the cultural institutions.<\/p><p>  I am grateful to have received the initial statement of the advisory group on commemorations chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning.  It emphasises the opportunity that now arises to support and encourage people to engage with their heritage at community and local level.  Formal and structured ceremonies will be arranged to commemorate the salient events on their centenaries in the coming years.  However, the important element of commemoration is not that historic events are brought to mind but that we seek to enhance our understanding of what happened and the enduring significance of the events for subsequent generations.<\/p><p>  Research and education will be at the core of the programme.  The initiatives of the universities will be complemented by the development of study modules and resources for schools.  The advisory group recently commenced a national consultation process on expectations and arrangements.  Following an initial meeting in Carlow, meetings are now being arranged to take place in Cork and Kerry.  Meetings are arranged in partnership with local authorities and promoted through local media and the network of local history societies.  I am conscious of the essential role of local authorities, schools and the history groups in ensuring the commemorative programme achieves its full potential with wide public participation.  County libraries and heritage officers will be at the forefront in presenting and facilitating initiatives.<\/p><p>  Although the commemorative programme embraces the totality of our history in the years from the third Home Rule Bill to the emergence of the Irish State, I am conscious of the strengthening interest in particular events and how they should be commemorated, most especially the Easter Rising and the Proclamation of the Republic.  This special consideration is not surprising.  In a world convulsed by war and with the Home Rule crisis unresolved and deferred, the Irish Republic was born of fire and endured to attract the committed support of the nation.  Determined to bring an end to British authority in Ireland that had endured for centuries, it necessarily entailed division with those in Britain and Ireland, especially Ulster, who wanted to preserve the Union enacted in 1800.<\/p><p>  The polarisation of communities in Ireland that had been defined during the Home Rule crisis was consolidated and took on an enduring expression.<\/p> <p>Notwithstanding this bitter legacy and the memory of the ensuing years of conflict, I believe that we can and should celebrate the Proclamation of the Irish Republic on its centenary in a way that is both sensitive and inclusive.<\/p><p> There is an important distinction to be made between commemoration and celebration.  In commemorating the Easter Rising, we would acknowledge the service, sacrifice and achievement of a remarkable group of volunteers, giving expression anew to the aspiration for national independence.  This is not done with disregard for the loss of life and destruction consequent on their actions.  It recognises the republican movement's belief in the urgent need for forceful and determined action to bring an end to the decline in Irish national identity and well-being.  The Easter Rising should not be represented as a spontaneous and isolated military adventure of a type not unfamiliar in the colonial age.  It was strongly rooted in the distresses and frustrated aspirations of the 19th century and before.  More than simply a resurgence of traditional culture, the Celtic revival is a reaction both to assimilation and modernity.  The British Red Cross Association and the St. John's Ambulance assessed the potential of Munster, Leinster and Connacht for war service in 1914 to be based on their having one fifteenth of the population of the United Kingdom and one twenty-eighth of the wealth.  It was further recognised that the disparity would be much greater if the measure had been of income rather than wealth.<\/p><p> On the imminent centenary of the Rising, I am confident that all will be able to transcend the sad elements of the history of former times.  In this regard, I express my appreciation of the acknowledgement of the republican tradition at Easter by the British ambassador and, more recently, by the Duke of Kent as they laid wreaths at Glasnevin in memory of the personnel of the Rising.  I hope that such gestures of reconciliation will inspire all to reflect on the relationships we would build for the future rather than to hold with the divisions of the past.<\/p><p> It has been suggested that the difficulties of current times should have precedence in our consideration, inhibiting the scale and scope of commemorations.  I agree that sensitive regard must be had to the challenges we face in restoring order to the public finances and that many people are now struggling to manage their finances.  However, the centenary of the Easter Rising is such a significant landmark in our national progress that we must seek to transcend all the issues of the moment and the differences between parties and traditions to ensure the optimal arrangements are put in place for us all to come together in commemoration.<\/p><p> The commemoration of the Easter Rising must not exult in the confrontation, destruction and death that characterised those days in Dublin, accounts of which have endured across the generations in the narrative of the heroic action.  The story of the Rising must be told, making use of all available sources and with a sense of genuine enquiry open to new analysis and commentary from unfamiliar perspectives.  Issues of recrimination must be left to rest with the passed generations.  Our aspiration must be towards a comprehensive consideration of the background, principles and motivation that brings new light rather than heat to the subject and that will enhance our understanding of persons and events.<\/p><p> Similar considerations arise in relation to the commemoration of the First World War.  How should we respond now to the catastrophic conflict 100 years ago that brought death and casualties on an unprecedented scale, with more than 50,000 Irishmen killed, and 250,000 taking part in the arms factories in Britain and on the battlefields of France?  We should start from remembrance.  Throughout Ireland there are families with private memories of lost relatives who passed away without acknowledgement in their communities. This was apparent in the response to the First World War roadshow initiative organised by the National Library of Ireland in the Europeana programme.  Privately held records and memorabilia were brought to the library to be digitised for inclusion in a database that can be shared internationally.  Public interest exceeded all expectations and a second event was organised in Limerick.<\/p><p> The same abiding commitment has been seen in the dedication of memorials to restore to our consciousness the Irish soldiers who died in the war.  Often organised at community and local level, new monuments and publications record the service and losses from Ireland in the terrible war that brought an end to the old order in Europe and the wider world.  On the invitation of the council chairman in County Cavan, I was very pleased to participate with Northern Executive Minister for Regional Development, Danny Kennedy, in the dedication of a small memorial in Virginia to the 24 local men who died in the war.  The gentle message of acceptance and respect inherent in that memorial testifies to the capacity in commemorations to contribute to the work of reconciliation.  The centenary presents an opportunity for us to look again at the extent to which regard for the Irish soldiers of the First World War was affected by the conflict between the Crown forces and the independence movement in Ireland.<\/p><p> Perhaps rooted in the destruction of two world wars and maybe because of events in our own age, concern has been expressed that the commemorative programme should not be dominated by military pageantry.  I am confident that most people will agree that the participation of the Defence Forces in commemorations is an important tradition and an important representation of the State on ceremonial occasions.  I am confident the Defence Forces will make a very substantial and distinguished contribution to commemorations in the coming years.  The Defence Forces will have a special responsibility this year in the centenary of the founding of the Irish Volunteers. The arrangements for this important commemoration in November are nearing completion and will be announced shortly.<\/p><p> A comprehensive programme of commemoration, prepared under the auspices of the ICTU, continues to explore and commemorate the history of the Dublin Lock-out.  I have been greatly impressed by the diversity of events and the many contributions to the programme, not only from trade unions but also from local authorities, cultural institutions, colleges, schools and the media.  Perhaps most importantly, the One City, One Book programme organised by Dublin City Council shows how our commemorations can reach beyond their original purpose to stimulate interest in history and literature with continuing rewards.<\/p><p> This opportunity to engage with our history through artistic expression is very important.  As we seek to relate to former times, there is a special and direct insight to be gained from their artistic output which has endured across the years.  Equally, the response of this generation expressed through the arts will be of wide public interest, encourage discussion and be a special part of our contribution to the continuing legacy of the revolutionary age.  Having afforded priority in my initial approach to certain continuing projects and new developments with a view to completion in 2016, I would now welcome suggestions with regard to the creative possibilities and special presentations that would constitute an artistic programme to complement the commemorations.<\/p><p> Another great opportunity available to us for this centenary programme is to make full use of new communications technologies to communicate our activities widely and encourage the participation of all interested people at home and abroad.  The strong and continuing commitment of the national cultural institutions to the digitisation of collections and archives enables everyone to conduct a research project on any aspect of family, local, cultural, economic, political or military history, thereby making their contribution to the portrait of Ireland in the revolutionary age.  Centenary related tourism in Ireland can be assisted by the development of informative smartphone applications and street guides.  The Century Ireland project has the capacity to reach out through Twitter and Facebook to bring its content to public attention.  I hope that people familiar with these technologies will be proactive in making suggestions of how they can be harnessed to contribute to our activities.  I acknowledge today the production of a supplement by <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, the third of a series on this particular period.  It is a fine publication.<\/p><p> I look forward to listening to Senators' suggestions.  The last time I was in the House to outline my vision for the decade of commemorations, I got some good ideas.  I very much appreciate the interest of this House in considering the progress and potential of the commemorative programme.  This House has a major contribution to make in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200012#L00300","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369220700,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire inniu.

Tugann s&eacute; seans d&uacute;inn &aacute;r dtuairim&iacute; f&eacute;in a nochtadh.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for outlining the progress being made in respect of the decade of commemorations.  That the commemorations cover such a long period of Irish history underlines how ancient a nation we are.  There is not a part of the world where the Irish footprint cannot be seen.  Irish missioners travelled abroad where they helped to develop education and medical systems and many Irish people were involved in emerging legislatures throughout the world.  We did not colonise any other country, which gives us a special status. <\/p><p> The Minister is correct that commemorations should be about more than focusing on the immediate event.  They should help us to understand who we are as a people, establish our national identity and set out our vision for the future and how we will fit into the world context.  All of these things are part of our highly diverse story.  Interestingly, we have often found out through dialogue and taking a fraternal and human approach that the diversity or division in this country is not as solid as we first believed.  The commemorations provide us with further opportunities for taking such an approach. <\/p><p> I am pleased the Minister devoted a considerable amount of his time to the 1916 Rising, which fits into the expectations of most Irish people.  It was in that period that we set about establishing our independence and taking control of our destiny.  The Proclamation of 1916, while one of the shortest charters of independence in the world, expresses sentiments that remain relevant to this day and shows the foresight of the Volunteers who were working under considerable pressure.  I have always been impressed by Terence MacSwiney's book, <i>Principles of Freedom<\/i>, in which he wrote that we must always look beyond the battle and know, in time, the type of Ireland we wish to establish.<\/p><p> The 1916 Rising can be commemorated in a way that is not divisive.  I would be surprised if any country did not commemorate its founding battle or struggle for independence.  Examples of this are evident in Britain, the United States and throughout Europe.  Such commemorations and the loyalty we ask people to give to the State and nation are expected.  I was always somewhat surprised by revisionists because I could never understand the reason they found it necessary to undertake a programme of revision.  It is not necessary to do so because people can interpret any event in the manner in which they wish. <\/p><p> I would like the relatives of those who fought in the 1916 Rising to be given a central part in the commemorations.  I recall a debate in the Seanad when relatives of the seven signatories to the Proclamation were present in the Visitors Gallery.  I felt part of history on that occasion because the names on the Proclamation were represented by their relatives. <\/p><p> It is important also that the commemoration of the 1916 Rising is not centralised.  In that regard, I welcome the initiative by The 1916-21 Club.  For those who are not familiar with the organisation, it is an all-party club that was established to ensure division would be left to one side.  It will launch its national programme in the historical setting of the Rotunda in Dublin on 22 June.  I thank the Minister and his committee for meeting representatives of the club to discuss the matter. <\/p><p> We should use every opportunity to build bridges, as we in Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; h&Eacute;ireann have done in holding Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann in Derry this year.  This decision was the subject of considerable debate.  Interestingly, some people on the republican as opposed to loyalist side took the view that we should not have an all-island event in Derry until a united Ireland had been achieved.  I took a different view because it is my belief that the cultural traditions of this country belong to all of its people.  We should underline that our ancient heritage is much more enduring and potent than recent political divisions.  The Fleadh Cheoil will demonstrate, as it did throughout the Troubles, that our traditions belong to everyone.  Hundreds of thousands of people will attend the event which will boost the morale of the people of Derry.  <\/p><p> On the issue of Moore Street, which I have discussed previously with the Minister, the area is a designated national monument and one of our most important national monuments.  It is the area to which the leaders of the Rising retreated and signed the surrender.  As such, it is similar to the Alamo.  To walk into Moore Street and see where The O'Rahilly and others died reminds us of the great sacrifices that were made at that time.  If it is not possible to have the national monument properly placed in Moore Street in time for the commemorations in 2016, I ask the Minister to consider making a declaration that a fully developed national monument will be located on the site.  Such a monument would encapsulate much of our history and provide young people with a focus with which to connect to this history.  At the same time, and I do not mean this in a mercenary sense, it would also be a wonderful tourist attraction.  I have seen the benefits of similar historical sites throughout the world.<\/p><p> I wish the Minister well with the work he is doing.  It is clear that much thought went into his presentation.  It behoves us all to be part of the effort to show that while it was necessary to fight for independence, much bridge-building has taken place in the meantime and should continue in future.  Our cultural identity must be central to the commemorative process from now until 1916.  Our language and the many other distinctive elements of our culture are our distinctive badge of nationhood and should be at the forefront of the forthcoming commemorations.  The first President of Ireland, Mr. Douglas Hyde, who was a member of the Protestant community, was also president of Conradh na Gaeilge and one of the foremost proponents of the Irish language.  Our language is a cohesive influence and element.

He is an extremely energetic and hard-working Minister and we will see the fruits of his labours in the period ahead.  In the run-up to the symbolic and poignant 1916 commemorations, I applaud the remarkable array of scheduled events and publications which honour all who played their part during that tumultuous and future defining era.  I commend the development, preservation and presentation of historical records by local authorities, which allowed new knowledge about the era to be brought to light.<\/p> <p>Unlike to the 1966 commemorations, which presented a somewhat monochrome view of history, I am pleased to note that the centenary commemorations will expand beyond the set-piece events to cover thematic issues such as the treatment of women and minorities.  The realities of the historical events are likely to be expanded upon.  <\/p><p> In light of the recent amnesty granted to Irish Army veterans who joined the allied forces in the Second World War, I hope the 2016 commemorations will recognise and acknowledge the diversity of traditions that see both Home Rule and British Army heritage within a large number of Irish families.  I believe these centenaries provide an excellent opportunity to ensure all traditions are treated with respect and understanding.  <\/p><p> As Government spokesperson on arts and culture in this House, I commend the investment, totalling &euro;1 million, by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in the online visual newspaper of the revolutionary period, <i>Century Ireland<\/i>, which the Minister has already mentioned and which was launched earlier this month.  The funding is testament to the Department's commitment to bringing this most pivotal point in our history and heritage to life in a fresh, innovative and exciting manner.  What is wonderful about this publication is that it seeks to respect the complexity of Irish historical experience, while affording a clearer understanding of the context in which the series of events took place.  It must be remembered that between the years 1913 and 1923, in particular, Irish society was transformed by the Dublin Lock-out, the Suffragette movement, the ever-strengthening assertion of civil and democratic rights, industrialisation, the progress of the organised labour movement and by education and the pioneering advances of science, all of which established the foundations for the very progressive society we enjoy today.  Meanwhile, the involvement of Boston College in this project prompts us to remember the diaspora and the friends of Ireland around the world who will wish to share in our commemorative programme and will be further encouraged to visit our shores.  It will continue the efforts of The Gathering in this regard.  <\/p><p> Tourists are not just enticed to come here by our striking scenery.  I concur with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s comments regarding our culture.  The fact that we are so rich in culture and heritage, along with our scenery and our personality as a people, is what is attractive to tourists.  I am particularly pleased that in addition to the collaborative partnership of Boston College and RTE, the national cultural institutions have been joined by Dublin City Gallery, the Hugh Lane Gallery, which last year opened its excellent exhibition of portraits, <i>Revolutionary States: Home Rule and Modern Ireland.<\/i>  Dublin City Library and Archives, University College Dublin, NUI Galway and the Dictionary of Irish Biography also contributed greatly.  <br \/><i>Century Ireland<\/i>will no doubt stimulate a renewed interest in the revolutionary period and I am delighted to see the use of new technologies to bring our history to new audiences, especially the younger generations and those who cannot easily access the special  presentations at the various cultural institutions.  Moreover, I also welcome the bringing forward of proposals outlined by Mr. John Kennedy of the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht on the military service pensions archive, a collection of statements that have the capacity to transform our understanding of revolutionary Ireland.  I understand the Government has indicated its willingness to publish material without censorship, save in very rare cases where the safety of surviving individuals might be put at risk.  This is very important and I welcome it.  It is an excellent idea to allow access to this information online for free and also at a dedicated facility that would provide a legacy for the centenaries which would be widely used and appreciated.<\/p><p> I am particularly pleased that all of our cultural institutions and local authorities are playing such an important role in the commemorations.  The continuation of the National Library of Ireland's <i>Europeana<\/i>First World War collection road show is an excellent interactive idea, giving families the chance to contribute artefacts and stories relating to the First World War to a pan-European exhibition.<\/p><p> It is of the utmost importance that the younger generations, in particular, are encouraged to engage with their historical heritage.  I hope this will continue at community level in schools and community groups.  I look forward to attending many of the upcoming events to commemorate the most transformative of eras in our nation's history.  I commend the Minister for his work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200014#N00200","speaker":"1153","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369221900,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire go dt&iacute; an Teach.  I welcome the Minister to the House today and thank him for giving us a further insight into his vision and plans for this series of commemorations over the next while.  I also congratulate the Minister, in particular, for the Century Ireland project, which is a unique and brilliant way to begin the debate on commemoration.  It is wonderful to see the Department leading that, in collaboration with Boston College and RTE.<\/p><p>  The Minister spoke passionately about his role and responsibility in this area almost a year ago when we discussed this topic in the Seanad.  I would like to add a few thoughts of my own to this debate today and, in particular, to advocate for the role of the living artist in participating in these great events of remembrance that are upon us.  To quote the President in a speech he gave a year ago in New York:<blockquote>We are now in a time which needs new myth-making, including a myth for our Irishness and I believe that this involves both the ethics of memory and the courage of imagination.  What should we remember, and how, what might we come to know, imagine, dare to hope and offer such an Irishness for new times as would be authentic and sustainable?<\/blockquote>The Minister is asking for this and I commend him for that.  The Minister has set out a sense of the infrastructure of how we might commemorate and remember what has happened over the next decade.  The participation of our communities, including our artists, in that is to be warmly welcomed and supported.<\/p><p>  President Higgins' challenge to all of us is to use the act of memory and remembrance as a way to construct a new vision and a new imagination for our communities and our society.  The challenge we have is not so much about commemorating the past but how to use our memory, both actual and fictional, to inform our future.  That could be the Minister's legacy in the years to come.  We have a wealth of knowledge through our national and local archives about what happened and I congratulate the Minister for supporting various online initiatives in this area.  However, we need to use this more to explore the challenges and, through our artists, debate the values of a renewed Ireland.  <\/p><p>  As I mentioned in a similar debate last year, memory has politics.  There is a healthy tension between memory and fact.  To tell the story of the Lock-out, the 36th Ulster Division of the British Army, the 16th Irish Division of the British Army, the uprising of 1916, the War of Independence or the Civil War we rely as much on great literature as we do on historical facts.  The play by Frank McGuinness, &quot;Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme&quot;<i>, <\/i>has as much impact as any archive or history lesson.  The same is true of the great play by Sebastian Barry, &quot;A Long Long Way&quot; or, indeed, Sean O'Casey's &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot;<i>.  <\/i>I am not in any way diminishing archives, exhibitions or museums as valid forms of remembering but simply arguing that good art or good writing can also serve history.  Memory and art will not neutralise emotion or injustice and that is the crux of the challenge of this centenary of commemoration.  The Minister has called on us to respond to that challenge.<\/p><p>  We should not be worried if one side appears to hi-jack a centenary celebration over another, providing that there is a multiple of those voices.  In that sense, I absolutely agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s advocation of a celebration of 1916.  In the Minister's own speech, he spoke quite poetically about the need to celebrate the Rising.  He said that the story of the Rising must be told, making use of all available resources and with a sense of genuine inquiry, open to new analysis and commentary.  That is where contemporary artists, be they playwrights, painters, visual artists or film makers, can respond in a way that we in this House cannot.<\/p><p>  We have examples from the past where the Irish Government either controlled a commemoration too rigidly, as in 1966, or ignored it, as in 1991.<\/p> <p>We should be confident that no one can control memory.  In this instance I again congratulate the Minister on his statement.  A subjective understanding of historical events should sit side-by-side with an objective explanation - we need both.  I quote Professor Richard Kearney of Boston College, who has written a brilliant paper on the ethics of memory: <blockquote>This ethical task of testimony is not simply an individual responsibility.  It is also a collective one.  Here, it seems, the ethical debt to the dead joins forces with the poetical power to narrate.  And we recall that the two modes of narrative - fiction and history - share a common origin in epic, which has the characteristic of preserving memories on the communal scale of societies.<\/blockquote>What I am saying is that the poet or writer of fiction is just as important as the historian in how we might make sense of commemoration or make sense of our history to look towards the future and the value of the future.  This is where artists are best placed to address narrative and memory through critical imagination.  Memory not only illuminates, it also illustrates and part of that illustration is the use of images to strike, in the sense of striking home, the horror of evil and the grace of goodness.<\/p><p> I had a deeply profound and confusing experience two weeks ago when I visited the battlefields of the First World War in Ypres and the Somme for the first time.  I knew through my limited historical knowledge what had happened in the First World War.  I knew about the Archduke Franz Ferdinand's assassination on 28 June 1914.  In our history lessons we were swiftly moved on to the League of Nations and the peace conference in 1919.  However, we were not necessarily told about the role of so many Irish - North and South - fighting in that war and their reasons for doing so.  In a way there was a kind of an embarrassment and a misunderstanding over why these young men went to fight in the war.  We need to be told that story.<\/p><p> We certainly know about the 36th (Ulster) Division from <i>Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme<\/i>, but we do not know about the 16th (Irish) Division, the Royal Munster Fusiliers, the Royal Irish Rifles or the Royal Dublin Fusiliers and how the 36th (Ulster) Division and the 16th (Irish) Division fought together shoulder-to-shoulder in the trenches.  That is a great image for us.  We speak about the Good Friday Agreement and communities, but working-class men from Dublin and working-class men from Belfast together fought.<\/p><p> That is part of history that I was not taught and I look to the Minister to consider how history can be used through schools.  Certainly those in my generation - people in their mid to late 40s - were not taught that through F.S. Lyons's course.  There is a generation that needs to be reminded.  For me it is profound to know that 80,000 people were not conscripted but volunteered in the first year to fight in the First World War and I imagine that the main reason was to escape poverty.  They joined the army not necessarily because of any nationalistic or imperialistic reasons but to escape poverty.  The fact that the Lock-out occurred the previous winter had much to do with it.  Our commemorations can look to how history can unravel certain myths that might not be as true.<\/p><p> We also need to consider the Civil War where more Irishmen were killed by each other than were killed by the Black and Tans during the War of Independence.<\/p><p> I agree with the Minister and commend him on his speech.  I am sure the Seanad would support the Minister in providing funding to contemporary artists, writers, actors, playwrights, painters and sculptors to encourage them to make sense of history and memory in order to help to challenge us as a nation to create new myths of Irishness for the 21st century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200015#O00200","speaker":"1167","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369222500,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Before I call Senator O'Keeffe, I acknowledge from my homeland in west County Cork some students from Rossa College in Skibbereen and their teachers.

It is great to hear about the Century Ireland project, which is a thoughtful and good place to start what will be a very intense period of commemoration and thought-provoking memories for many people.  It is also good to see the harmony in this House, as we talk about this.  Some people may have feared that these commemorations might become somehow divisive, but I do not believe that will be the case.  We in this House have a role to play in ensuring that does not happen.<\/p><p>I wish to start with the story of a Dubliner, George Gibson, who was sent out to buy tea, sugar and butter for his mother.  Instead he put the money on a horse and lost.  Instead of going home, he ended up enlisting in the British Army - in the Lancashire Fusiliers.  He ended up at the second Battle of Ypres, where for the first time the Germans used poison chlorine gas on a large scale.  George was gassed and his eyesight damaged.  He was invalided out like many others.  However, George was well enough to be shipped back to the front just in time for the Battle of the Somme, where he served as a stretcher-bearer because, of course, his eyesight was not good enough to fight.  He was injured again with shrapnel and was shipped back to the UK.  He ended up going back to thing he perhaps loved most - working for a bookie's shop in Liverpool.<\/p><p>As that was happening to George, his brother, Richard, while he did not go shopping, also enlisted with the Irish Citizen Army.  He thought he was going on a parade and going on to Fairyhouse - it is clear that horses were a big thing in their house.  Instead he found himself in the GPO on Easter Monday 1916, aged 18 with his shotgun.  He was also wounded just like his brother, trying to escape to Moore Street with the O'Rahilly, his commanding officer, who was, of course, killed in that event.  Richard's was a serious wound - a bullet from a Lewis machine gun lodged in his shoulder, which was no joke in 1916.  He was shot right outside Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street.  He could not fight further and was subsequently incarcerated in Kilmainham and in other prisons, and ended up in Frongoch where he met Michael Collins. <\/p><p>The two wounded brothers, George and Richard, came together again during the War of Independence, working for Michael Collins.  Richard was setting up a bookie business in Dublin, and he and George, still in the UK, used their work on the racecourses and bookies' offices as cover for carrying messages around the UK and delivering them at racecourses where, of course, crowds of people would be gathered and they would be less noticed.  They were able to pick up intelligence there and send it back to Dublin.<\/p><p>People such as Richard and George should be our touchstones as we try to work out how to commemorate the events of what historian Eric Hobsbawm famously has called the age of catastrophe - that terrible time between 1914 and 1945.  They remind us that real people - men and women, brothers, sisters, fathers and mothers - are at the heart of all these big events, including the Lock-out, the First World War, the Easter Rising, the War of Independence and the Civil War.  Real people need to be remembered for who they were, not for who we think they were or for what we imagine they were.<\/p><p>I do not believe that Richard and George ever thought then that they should be commemorated or that people would discuss them nearly 100 years later.  That is the very point - they were of the now back then and they did what they thought they should do.  They were not showmen and were not trying to create legacy.  They were not positioning themselves somewhere in the hope of being important.  They did what they thought was right - although perhaps George might be described as taking the scenic route to doing the right thing.  These two young men are at the heart of what we want to commemorate.  While their story is a classic one of brothers apparently fighting on opposite sides, the truth is, of course, somewhat different.  The devil is always in the detail - not just the top line.<\/p><p>Commemorating these events, as we are 100 years later, we must be careful and considered, and observe the complexities of the stories as shown by Richard and George.  We need to observe the facts, avoiding the cheap, reductionist, headline style of commemorating which is attractive because it feeds a quick narrative about important events and expands their importance.<\/p><p>Of course, we choose to commemorate these events because it is an important part of defining who we are as a people and who we think we are.  It is part of the process of identifying ourselves, believing in ourselves and understanding our place in the world.  I believe Senator Noone referred to the 50th anniversary celebrations.  I have here a photograph of Richard Gibson at that commemoration.  I believe somebody used the word &quot;monochrome&quot; and the photograph is monochrome.<\/p> <p>He was presented with this to show he had been in the GPO in 1916.  It is a beautiful piece of work.  Perhaps the National Library of Ireland road show of the Great War could be repeated or extended.  These are the types of valuable things people have in their homes.  It is a beautiful piece of handmade work to commemorate that event.  We have moved on 50 years and we are now more distanced.  As stated by the Minister, we now have a greater capacity to inquire and be fresh in our approach to these events.<\/p><p>I attended the very interesting lecture in the National Library last night by Professor Conor Gearty, during which the Minister also spoke.  Professor Gearty spoke about the power of testimony - the affidavit and sworn memories people have - and the interpretation of events many years later.  Rosemary Joyce, a professor of anthropology at UC Berkeley has spoken about these public ceremonies fixing in our minds a common account of what happened regardless of whether or not we were there, which account embodies attitudes and perspectives as well as facts.<\/p><p>No tragedy is immune to being taken up in a political narrative.  The danger is how they are re-interpreted.  Historians, much like lawyers and politicians, have a way of framing history and of creating a narrative argument.  They will always be affected by the time and place of their construction.  Some may, perish the thought, be affected by a desire to create a wave, make a name for themselves, build a personal reputation or simply make money.   At the very good commemoration conference held by Queens University Belfast at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham the historian Jay Winters warned us to beware of historians determining our public memory.  He likened commemorations to a cathedral for secular societies, where sacred questions - those about the nature of love, life, death, comradeship and sacrifice - are asked and sometimes answered.  It is because of these great emotions, love, life and death, that we run the risk of clouding our commemorative process with the sentimental glorification of events in a manner which would cause people like George and Richard to squirm if they could see or hear it.  It is not only people in Ireland who worry about how to commemorate such events.  There is a whole business of commemoration, sociological and psychological studies, advisors, consultants and bandwagon jumpers.<\/p><p>In the UK, there is some controversy at the moment about Prime Minister David Cameron's remarks comparing the commemorations for 1914 to those of the recent Diamond Jubilee celebrations for the Queen and calling for them to be about stressing the national spirit.  Some well-known actors and personalities, such as Jude Law, Vanessa Redgrave, Ken Loach, want the First World War commemorations to be used to stop current wars and to remind people of the brutal loss of life in terms of the 16 million who died and the 20 million wounded rather than as a commemoration of national spirit.  The debate about how we commemorate and what we want goes on.<\/p><p>Let us step carefully.  Let us ensure we account for the different views.  The Minister has indicated that this is what is being done.  We want local authorities, schools and communities to be part of the commemorations.  Do we want to learn from the memories and accept all the lessons?  Are we ready for this?  Do we want to applaud all of it or acknowledge the mistakes?  If so, how?  Let us not glorify what was not glorious.  Let this very important decade of events be about restoring the humanity of those events, the reality of them and the people who fought and died.  Richard Gibson never glorified his own contribution.  He would tell his grandson Paul about the day he was shot: &quot;How did it feel?  What did I do?  I did what any good soldier would do son, - I lay down and passed out!&quot;  His other great line on the events leading up to Easter 1916 was very simple: &quot;Don't volunteer&quot;.  His brother, George, lived out his life in Liverpool with his family.  He even became an Everton supporter.  We will remember Richard - Dick to his family and friends - as the man who smoked a pipe, lived in Stoneybatter, liked the occasional glass of whiskey and was called Daddy by his daughter Catherine.<\/p><p>I welcome his daughter Catherine, Kay, here today with her husband Des Murray who are my mother and father-in-law.  I want to pay tribute here to Dick and George and to remember them because above all else, above the national good, the great tradition, the history, the monuments and the solemnity, they were part of a family.  Remembering them sustains the living.  That ultimately is why this decade matters.  There are other events that will be commemorated at this time, including women getting the vote in 1918 and the millennium of the Battle of Clontarf in 1044.  The Minister would of course be disappointed if I did not mention 2015, the 150th anniversary of the birth of W.B. Yeats,  former Senator.<\/p><p>As outlined by Senator Mac Conghail, this is an opportunity to support living artists and writers who will re-interpret the past and illuminate the present and in so doing commemorate those great people like Richard and George.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200016#P00300","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369223100,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome Senator O'Keeffe's mother and father-in-law to the Visitors Gallery.

The RTE broadcast of Barry McGovern reading Strumpet City was immensely powerful.  I am glad that the Minister has stated that this will be a diverse commemoration.  I recall with horror the 1966 celebration, which was a grotesque, triumphalist celebration from which anybody who was not quite heterosexual, republican and Roman Catholic, was ruthlessly excluded.  <\/p><p>The visit to Ireland by Queen Elizabeth II was a tribute to the Nationalist element of our population.  It was a remarkable event, one welcomed by people here.  For this reason, it is important we ensure the commemorations are diverse.  I welcome the use of the word &quot;commemoration&quot;.  I also welcome that a former leader of this House, Dr. Maurice Manning, is involved.  When it comes to 1916, I wonder how much we have to celebrate.  It gives us an opportunity to take stock of our once again being victims of a rigid economic theory being applied willy nilly in this country from an imperial centre.  We currently have soup kitchens, evictions and rack-renting in the sense that people who dare to improve their property now have to pay a higher price.

I was too bashful to mention the Fitzpatrick-Mac Giolla Ph&aacute;draig families.  In terms of celebrations and The Gathering and so on, we should take on board the clan idea.  There are many hundreds of thousands, perhaps, millions of people who have great Irish names such as Fitzpatrick, Doyle, Deenihan, Barrett, Coghlan and O'Keeffe.

According to an article by the former editor of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, Conor Brady, he was from County Laois and was among the ancestors of the Mac Giolla Ph&aacute;draig clan.  He was educated at Clonenagh monastery and went around with his great friend, St. Enda, until the latter became homesick and came back.  They were so impressed by Benedict's holiness that they elected him pope, but after the departure of St. Enda, he became so homesick that he returned after only three days.  He was never officially crowned but he is a pope.  We should make a meal out of that because it is a bloody good story.  It is every bit as good as the bleeding statues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200017#Q01400","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369223700,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, who was nominated to the Seanad by Garret FitzGerald.

The Seanad will be playing a big role in the celebrations the Minister is organising.<\/p><p>Muckross House and the RIC barracks in Caherciveen, in the Minister's home county, have been restored as part of a heritage project.  Both places would have been regarded as Unionist in the past but they are also part of our heritage, and the Minister is well placed to represent them.  His fellow county man and friend, Se&aacute;n Kelly, helped to foster unity in sport in this country by allowing rugby matches to be held in Croke Park.  County Kerry is leading by example in this regard.  These commemorations should be honoured equally in the Glens of Antrim, Derry, the Mournes and every other part of the country.  We have to emphasise the inclusiveness to which the President referred.  I am reminded of the wonderful photograph from Oldbridge, along the River Boyne, of the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and the Rev. Ian Paisley as they commemorated a piece of Irish history.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; spoke about Douglas Hyde, who in 1931 was asked by students of the TCD historical society to be president of the society.  He said he would do it on condition they first asked Edward Carson.  Here we see the first President of Ireland nominating a leader of the Ulster Unionist Party for an important post in the history of student societies.  We should include parliamentarians like Butt, Parnell and Redmond, who took arduous journeys to confront the majority in Westminster on behalf of the Irish people.  Of course, Daniel O'Connell took an even more arduous journey in his time.  They are all part of what we are commemorating.  There is a strong Irish parliamentary tradition.  A new book on Edmund Burke was launched last night.<\/p><p>Our historic buildings are in much better condition compared with our last decade of commemorations.  Dublin Castle has been splendidly restored, as has the Royal Hospital and, most recently, the museum building in Trinity.  They are part of our heritage.  Senator Mac Conghail referred to music and the arts.  These should not be divisive.  There should be no bitterness or dwelling on sadness.  As Senator O'Keeffe has noted, we certainly should be determined to ensure there are no more wars.

It is nice to hear my good friend and colleague, Senator Barrett, mention the famous buildings in our history, including one that is close to my heart and that of the Minister, namely, Muckross House.  In welcoming the Minister and thanking him for his overview, I also commend him on the work he has done to mark the important anniversaries of our history.  In particular, I praise the work of the all-party group on commemorations, which the Minister chairs, and the academic advisory group chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning and ably assisted by Dr. Martin Mansergh.  They are taking exactly the right approach on the commemorative programme.  I had the pleasure of hearing Dr. Manning, Dr. Mansergh and John Kennedy in the not so distant past.  Many ongoing initiatives are worthy of mention but I was particularly impressed by the way in which the Century Ireland website, which was recently launched, sets the benchmark for the kind of accessible historical resource that will serve us well over the decade.  I thank the Minister for supporting for this project.<\/p><p>As the Minister is aware I have the honour of serving on committee A of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, which last year produced a report on the decade of commemorations.  We spoke to key individuals and organisations involved in commemorative activity and I believe that the report we produced is balanced and sensitive.  The Minister generously acknowledged this in a fine letter to the committee.  He also acceded to our request for a meeting with him, and we perhaps we can arrange one after we visit Belfast next month.  We noted in particular how commemorative activity in Northern Ireland can be a key part of the process of reconciliation.  The work of Belfast City Council's good relations committee and the recent exhibition, entitled Shared History, Different Allegiances, was of an extremely high standard.  We noted, too, the particular importance of commemorating the First World War in the east-west element of commemorations.  The events of the decade affected all the people of these islands and shaped relations between Britain and Ireland for the ensuing century.  The attendance of the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste at Remembrance Day ceremonies in Northern Ireland was a moving and historic gesture towards a shared remembrance of the past.<\/p><p>Many people consider remembrance or commemoration of the past as dangerous because they think it might open up old wounds or enflame old antagonisms.  It is true we must remain vigilant against those who would exploit the anniversaries for negative purposes, but the decade of commemorations also represents a vital opportunity.  By learning more about our past and the history of all the people of this island, we learn more about ourselves and, more important, we learn more about those of other communities and traditions, allowing us to put ourselves in their shoes and gain a better understanding of their perspectives.<\/p><p>We do not have to agree about everything.  For some of us, the Easter Rising is the central event of the decade.  We can hold this belief proudly and unapologetically.  However, that does not mean we can fail to acknowledge the alternative views legitimately held by others.  The centenary of the Ulster Covenant was of particular importance to the Unionist community in Northern Ireland and it is important to acknowledge that.  I was very pleased to see the First Minister being invited to Iveagh House last year to deliver the Edward Carson lecture in that context.<\/p><p>While much valuable historical research will be carried out over the course of the decade, if commemorations are to be truly successful, they must capture the broader imagination of the public.  The past is too important to be left solely to the historians, vital though their role may be.  I hope local community initiatives will have a central place in the Government's programme for the decade.  The Minister has indicated he will encourage this in every respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200018#R00300","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"speech","time":1369223700,"counter":274,"content":"<p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  This is an opportunity to discuss what has been dubbed the decade of commemorations, that is, the collection of significant commemorations we will observe in the years to come, from the formation of the UVF last year through 1916 and up to 1923 and the ending of the Civil War.  The Government's advisory committee of academic and other experts, chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning, and a group comprising senior officials from relevant Departments are planning the State's centenary programme and advising the Oireachtas committee.  A similar group has been established in the Assembly under the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, which is headed by the Sinn F&eacute;in Minister, Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n.<\/p><p>While the establishment of the Oireachtas committee is welcome, I must put on record my dissatisfaction with the manner in which it is conducting its business.  It appears that the committee has not achieved a great deal.  It has held discussions and meetings but it has not produced many concrete plans.  Even with the best will in the world, the Government has not provided the resources to allow it to do anything considerable or worthwhile.  It has no real budget.  It is highlighting and endorsing events and, to some extent, tying into them, but it is not supporting them in any tangible way and it is certainly not providing any resources.<\/p> <p>Later this year sees the centenary of the foundation of the Irish Volunteers who would play a key role in the rising.  However, it is not yet clear what is planned as regards the commemoration of the establishment of the volunteers, despite the fact that this is mere months away.  I would welcome the Minister's clarification on what is planned in that regard.  <\/p><p>Neither is it clear what we will see for the cornerstone commemoration in 2016.  What events are planned?  I understand Easter Monday will see a major event but details are sketchy.  A considerable number of events were organised for the 50th anniversary at considerable expense at the time.  This included a major play in Croke Park, the production of records by Gael Linn and much more but it took some time in planning.  They did not throw it together in a short timeframe.<\/p><p>If the Government has major festivals or concerts in mind or if it wishes to declare a public holiday, we would like to see more action sooner.  We are aware the Government will be putting the 1916 pension records online.  That is a welcome and positive development.  However, it was an initiative which had begun under the previous Government.  Likewise, the refurbishment of Glasnevin Cemetery is positive, but it too began previously.  As there is not much money, resources or planning going into this we have yet to see any real, tangible, new initiatives.  <\/p><p>As has been mentioned, there is also the outstanding issue of the Moore Street site.  The Minister is responsible for the decision on what becomes of the Moore Street site.  He has seen all the presentations and heard all the discussions at which he was present.  He knows the huge potential of this site.  It could be a tremendous attraction for tourists and would provide a marvellous focus for so many 1916 events yet currently it is in limbo.  The possibility of a shopping centre being built on the site is offensive.  I urge the Minister to ensure the site is protected and added to as part of a revolutionary quarter in the north inner city.<\/p><p>There are other aspects of the 1916 legacy that need greater support.  Locals near Richmond Barracks are seeking support to renovate and preserve the barracks.  This is a key site where some leaders were held before they were executed.  However, they have not been met with great support.  <\/p><p>Likewise, it appears there is a lack of tour guides in Kilmainham Jail and a lack of capacity.  Recently, someone in Deputy Gerry Adams's office rang to arrange a tour in the jail for a group and was told that the next date that could be arranged was September.  That is disgraceful.  It is a popular location and we should seek to ensure that as many people as possible have the opportunity to visit it.<\/p><p>In my constituency we are still unsure what will be the outcome as regards the refurbishment and development of an interpretive centre at Pearse's Cottage, Teach an Phiarsaigh.  I would welcome a clear statement from the Minister on that because on a number of occasions on the Adjournment I asked the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, about it and he gave us a commitment that the Government would have that centre built by 2016.  In November of last year he told me it was on the desk of F&aacute;ilte Ireland for consideration for a capital grant and that he was hopeful that would be processed.  I have written to F&aacute;ilte Ireland on two occasions and did not get any clarification but perhaps the Minister could clarify for us where he stands on the issue.  Will he reconfirm the Government's commitment to have the interpretive centre at Teach an Phiarsaigh built in time for 2016?<\/p><p>D'fh&eacute;adfainn cuid mhaith &aacute;bhair eile a ard&uacute;.

It is a fantastic initiative and I commend all involved in that, including RTE.<\/p><p>This period is about the commemoration of 1913, 1916, the War of Independence and the Civil War but it is also about local issues.  History is not solely about remembering war; it is about remembering events that happened, and events happen in local communities.  Unlike the previous speaker I believe it is very important that we work together, from the Minister down, to ensure that events happen locally.  As we speak, fantastic events to do with The Gathering are taking place across the country, and local people are getting involved in that.<\/p><p>I want to highlight an issue in which I am honoured to be involved in my town of Carrick-on-Suir, namely, the erection of a 9 ft monument to Maurice Davin, the first president of the GAA and the only president to serve two terms.  That event will take place on 1 June because local people from the three local hurling and football clubs, Carrick Davins, Carrick Swan and St. Mullins, along with other local people and assisted by the chairman of the Tipperary county board, Se&aacute;n Nugent, came together, fund-raised and accessed grants available to people across the country to carry out such functions.  The president of the GAA, Liam O'Neill, will be present for that event, as will many people in this Chamber.  There is an open invitation to it and we will commemorate in our own way our famous son, Maurice Davin, who founded the GAA in 1884 in Thurles with Cusack and who was world champion in athletics at the time.  After winning the British championships in 1881 he was asked by one of his fellow competitors if he thought he was the best athlete in Ireland to which he responded, &quot;Well, I'm definitely the best athlete in Britain after today.&quot;  <\/p><p>Davin founded the GAA because at that time athletics in this country was governed under British rules and he wanted to stamp our identity in his own way, which is the identity that became the GAA in which the Minister had great involvement over the years.  It is an important moment but I raise that because it shows that people can commemorate history locally by their own actions in their own communities.  That is what this decade of commemoration should be about.  As I pointed out earlier, history should be remembered by citizens.  Senator O'Keeffe made a valid point about the way history is written and subsequently read.  It is important that local people should write the history of their own area as they know and understand it.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister for all the work going on and I have full confidence that the events to be held in 2016 and the other notable dates during this decade will be organised properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200019#S00500","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1369224300,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I will oblige the Acting Chairman by being as brief as possible.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leis ar an obair at&aacute; &aacute; d&eacute;anamh aige sa Rialtas go ginear&aacute;lta, agus go h&aacute;irithe ar an &oacute;r&aacute;id fhairsing a thug s&eacute; tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na.<\/p><p>In welcoming the Minister I had forgotten that he had been appointed to the Seanad by Garret FitzGerald.  If that had not happened Fine Gael would have lost one of its greatest vote-getters and Kerry politics, and national politics, would be the poorer for it.  I hope the Minister will remember the Seanad and how it gave him a good start.<\/p><p>The Minister's contribution was thoughtful and balanced but I would like to pick up on some of the points made.  There is no doubt that the decade we are celebrating was one of tremendous excitement, and events happened at an extraordinarily fast pace.  It must have been a very exciting time to be alive.  The generation that experienced it have gone to their reward but they were very much alive and kicking in 1966, to which I will refer shortly.  My generation had to learn about it while on the knees of our grandparents.  For many of my generation the film &quot;Mise &Eacute;ire&quot; captured that sterling period for us in an indelible way with O'Riada's fantastic soundtrack.  There was so much happening in that entire movement, with Yeats's &quot;All that delirium of the brave&quot;, it must have been an intoxicating period.<\/p><p>Despite criticism of the 1966 celebrations some very good events were held.  The RTE programming was outstanding but, unfortunately, most of those archives were wiped, including long interviews with all the surviving leaders in the Easter Rising.  That was a terrible mistake.  The renaming of our major railway stations after the signatories was welcome also.  Such initiatives were valid.<\/p> <p>We may have made mistakes in 1966 and we must learn from them.<\/p><p>Without giving the Minister the litany, the key moments are the Lock-out; the formation of the volunteers in November 1913 which was a massive event with more than 3,000 people in the Rotunda and has many more trying to get in; the Great War; the gun running at Larne and Howth; the funeral of O'Donovan Rossa, which was a seminal moment in the lead up to 1916; the Rising itself; the declaration of independence from which all else hangs; the War of Independence; the first D&aacute;il; and the cultural revolution and Celtic revival.  I hope Dublin City Council will agree to the proposal made by the Abbey Theatre and Senator Mac Conghail that the new bridge will be called the Abbey Theatre bridge because the Celtic revival had a huge part to play in our nationalist movement.<\/p><p>I was a typical rural republican and I learned my attitude to 1916 at home.  As I got older I realised there was a different story, perspective and narrative.  I certainly have the greatest respect for people such as John Redmond and those who took what was an unpopular position at the time.  There was bitterness for a long time afterwards.  I remember my grandmother saying that someone I had praised had worn the poppy, which was a major crime in her view.  We have moved on from this and we respect those who enlisted in the British army such as Tom Kettle, Francis Ledwidge and many others including Tom Barry.  When some soldiers fighting in the First World War heard about the Rising in Dublin they felt betrayed.  Others, such as Barry, asked themselves what they were doing in Gallipoli fighting for the British when they should be at home fighting for the freedom of Ireland.  It cut different ways.  We now have a national day of commemoration when all traditions are embraced, and this has been a very important step forward.<\/p><p>Were we too triumphant in 1966?  We probably were.  Was there too much militarism about it?  There are probably was.  I certainly would like to see the Army have a profile in 2016 and in all other commemorations, but a lower profile.  Unlike many of my colleagues here I do not believe the Army should be in churches for ceremonies; there is something incongruous about it.  We were a young and emerging nation in 1966 and we had to show a little teaspach, which is only natural.  Half of the Deputies at the time had been gunmen during the Rising and the War of Independence and it was natural to let off a bit of steam.  Senator Norris was a bit harsh about it.  We must be more circumspect and careful this time.<\/p><p>I agree with Senators O Murch&uacute; and &Oacute; Clochartaigh with regard to Moore Street and it is very important that we put down a marker on it.  The Minister has been grappling with it for quite some time and it is not an easy matter.<\/p><p>There will also be an economic dividend from the commemorations.  Recently I noticed tours of the hidden Third Reich are organised in Berlin, and lads in Dublin organise walking tours on 1916 which begin at the International Bar.  As we move towards the seminal dates we should have much more of this and I am sure there is no better man than the Minister to exploit and develop it for tourism purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200019#S00600","speaker":"1142","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369224900,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I have found the debate very interesting and I particularly enjoyed the comments of Senator O'Sullivan.

We have debated this matter in the House previously.  On checking the records I found that in 2006 when I was on the other side of the House I proposed we begin to plan for the centenary of the 1916 Rising because we have a responsibility to deal with commemorating that particularly difficult decade in a sensitive and wise fashion.  It is said of the Irish that our wars are merry and our songs are sad, and this is something on which we should reflect.  We must be advised by history rather than imprisoned by it.  We are unique as a nation in the sense our political process is so much imprisoned by history.  Three of our four large political parties are defined by history.  Perhaps one is defined by ideology, but three, namely, Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in, exist because of historical moments and divisions.  Perhaps the country has not been served too badly by our political system, but anybody who tries to examine the Irish political system finds it difficult to come up with reasons the political parties stand for certain ideas.  Of course it is because we are historically based and we must now try to reach beyond this.<\/p><p>I look forward to the Minister putting his plans into action, and some of them are already bearing fruit.  We have spoken here previously about the need for people to be in a position to study history in a more unbiased fashion.  We have spoken about the need to ensure history remains on the curriculum as a subject which people are encouraged to study and not just dismissed as a subject to be given up at the end of first year.  Many of us would not have been imprisoned by history for so long if there had been a better study and understanding of Irish history.  In this sense I hope the various celebrations had commemorations will be helpful.<\/p><p>Senator O'Sullivan was correct to state it is easy to be too harsh about the 1966 commemoration.  We look at it now in a different prism.  When we see the black and white footage of marching men  - there were no marching women - and church ceremonies and pageantry it looks very outdated but that was then and we must do things differently now.<\/p><p>This is a very weighty subject which we could debate at length.  Our job is to ensure all we do in celebrating, commemorating and reflecting is useful for the Ireland of the next decade and beyond.  If we want to pay tribute to people of all Irish traditions and all political divides the best way to do so is to build a new Ireland and a better republic.  Let us learn from the past but let us not be imprisoned by it.  This should be the theme of all of our celebrations and commemorations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200020#T00400","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1369224900,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we conclude the debate at 2.10 p.m. to allow the Minister respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200020#T00600","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1369224900,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I have found it very informative and in my response I will mention a few ideas which I will put in place.  I thank the Senators for their sincerity and honesty.<\/p><p>I stated at the beginning my vision is to have a debate which will be tolerant, inclusive and respectful of everybody, and this is something we can all share and enjoy together.  There is no reason whatsoever to be in any way divisive about the debate.  Everything possible is being done to ensure the commemoration is carried out properly.  Other activities which I have not referred to here will also take place.  Everybody is invited to participate and it is up to them whether they want to do so.  It is up to the media as to whether they report these activities, and the media have a very important role to play.  The tone of the debate was generally positive and I thank the Senators for this.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator O Murch&uacute;'s vision for Ireland and on how we can be informed by the decade of commemorations to enhance this vision and what people mean by &quot;Gaelic Ireland&quot; and how we can foster it in the sense of the European Union and the world order at present, and how very important it is that we express our Irishness now was much as ever.<\/p> <p>This debate can inform that overall vision, which Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; expands on better than most.<\/p><p>The Senator mentioned something that was important, that being, involving the relatives of the 1916 GPO figures.  Mr. Maurice O'Keeffe, an historian from County Kerry whom Senator O'Sullivan would know well, commenced a series of interviews with relatives of those who fought in 1916.  There were approximately 2,000 people out, as they say, in 1916, 1,800 men and 200 women.  We are focusing on those who fought in the GPO and their families.  Mr. O'Keeffe has conducted 90 good interviews.  We will bring the people in question together in Dublin Castle in November.  They are from all political persuasions.  Their families might have been in contact previously, but never have they all met at the same time.  We are holding the event to recognise them and to ensure a spirit of inclusiveness whereby everyone can sit down around the table, discuss 1916 and feel a part of it.<\/p><p>I was delighted to be able to meet the 1916-21 Club and I hope to work closely with it while in this job.<\/p><p>The fleadh cheoil of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann is one of the country's great bridge builders.  I am not being patronising when I say that Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s organisation does a significant amount of work.  I am pursuing an arts in education programme.  We have a charter.  In terms of those schools around the country that promote the arts, Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann is one of the most active organisations.  In the school just up the road from me, every child from second class to sixth class can play an instrument.  By sixth class, children can play five instruments because people like Mr. Willie Larkin provide a service to the school through Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann.  That is some achievement.<\/p><p>I agree with the Senator that organising the fleadh cheoil in Derry was the right decision.  Concerns were raised about security, but I am convinced that it will be a resounding success.  I look forward to joining the Senator in the North with my counterpart in Northern Ireland, Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, and other interested parties.<\/p><p>A number of Senators mentioned Moore Street.  As they know, 14-17 Moore Street is a national monument.  My decision will be on whether the proposal is a proper one and whether it interferes with the national monument.  The deliberations, the environmental impact assessment and the environmental impact statement have been conducted and I have received advice from the National Museum.  I will make a final decision shortly as I do not want to allow the situation to drag on.  It will be my decision.  I will listen to reasonable people, but I will not be influenced by any extreme view.  I will take my decision to the Cabinet, which I am sure will accept it.<\/p><p>In terms of the site's history, it is important to point out that the former Minister, Mr. Dick Roche, designated 14-17 Moore Street as a national monument.  In 1999, planning permission was granted to demolish the entire site, including the battlefield and the monument.  Our respect for the men and women of 1916 has come on a great deal.  The current planning permission, which was granted by Dublin City Council and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, allows for the demolition of the rest of the site, including the battlefield and O'Rahilly's area of retreat.  He was a Kerryman like Senator O'Sullivan and me.  I have close contact with the O'Rahilly family.  I had nothing to do with the decision of Dublin City Council and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as it pertains to the site beyond 14-17 Moore Street.  People do not fully understand the decision that I must make - it is on the monument, not the rest of the site, in respect of which a decision has already been made.  The cohesive influence of our cultural identity is important.<\/p><p>Senator Noone made a good contribution.  As a young Senator, she sees the relevance of the decade of commemorations in informing people of her generation about the respect we should have for those who gave their lives for our freedom and the sacrifices they made.  When they signed the Proclamation, they were undoubtedly signing their lives away.<\/p><p>The Senator also referred to thematic issues and identified the role of women.  The suffragette movement was strong in 1913.  Even as Redmond was trying to gain home rule for Ireland, he was being attacked by the suffragettes.  His bust was defaced with paint by a suffragette.  He had nearly achieved home rule and the suffragettes were campaigning for the vote.  It is worth remembering that, irrespective of class, creed, race and so on, no woman in the UK or Ireland had a vote in the House of Commons.  Thanks to the Suffragette movement, any woman over 30 years of age could vote in the 1918 election.  The first woman elected to the House of Commons was Constance Markievicz, although she did not take her seat.  Approximately 12 women ran for election.  She was an extraordinary woman and I hope that her role up to 1926 will be fully recognised.<\/p><p>Apart from the Suffragette movement, the founding of Cumann na mBan in April 1914 was a significant development.  It was one of the country's largest organisations.  It was founded as an ally for the Volunteers rather than a support mechanism.  Its members were active and wanted to be involved in the overall movement, which they were during the 1916 Rising.  It is important that we recognise the fact that some of those involved in founding Cumann na mBan were very strong women.  I have put in place a group under Dr. Mary McAuliffe of UCC and the Women's History Association of Ireland.  We want to show the courage of and considerable role played by these women.  The group is in place and a significant event will be held to recognise them next April.<\/p><p>Senator Noone also mentioned the military service pensions archive.  It is an exciting prospect.  I advise every Senator to visit the Bureau of Military History, which holds 2,000 testaments.  If Senators want to understand the history of the time, they should read those testaments.  I am fascinated by them and read them whenever I get a chance.  They are available online.  For example, I have read about people like Ernest Blythe, the organisation of the volunteers in my home county of Kerry, his joining of the Gaelic League, how he came from County Antrim to learn Irish and became friendly with Se&aacute;n O'Casey, how he became involved in the Irish Republican Brotherhood, IRB, and his connection with the volunteers.  It is an amazing story.<\/p> <p>Or take a person like Eoghan Mac Neill, whose story is very understated in our history, and who was very much involved in setting up the Gaelic League with Douglas Hyde.  His name is on the poster for the Volunteers, along with that of Kettle.  He was the person most responsible for setting up the Volunteers and had amazing organisational ability.  At that stage, he was professor of early medieval history in UCD so he was a man who did not have to do this.  He did it, however, and later became a Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200020#T00900","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369226100,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I am loth to intervene but the Minister's colleague is waiting.

I agree completely with him and this is something with which we will engage.  Last Friday, I saw the production of &quot;An R&iacute;&quot; by Padraig Pearse in the Abbey Theatre, first produced 100 years ago.  James Plunkett's <i>Strumpet City <\/i>is the themed book for this year.  I believe we can do a great deal with the connection between artists and writers and the decade of commemorations.  It is not only the artists of the time - there were also people such as Sean Keating who produced some iconic paintings such as <i>On the Run, Men of the South, Men of the West <\/i>and so many more relating to this period.  He told the narrative of that period.  There were others, too, great portrait painters such as John Lavery, and many others.   There is a great opportunity here and this is something we will certainly discuss.<\/p><p>  Senator O'Keeffe's contribution was very touching.  We should feel honoured that Ms Kay Murray, the daughter of Richard Gibson, is present today.  There is that great connection and the human interest story which is so important to this narrative.  There are so many other stories like that which can and must be told at this time.  It is great that Ms Murray can be in the Chamber while we are having this debate and that she can hear her daughter-in-law make such a wonderful contribution.  This is one of the positive aspects of what we can do during the decade of commemorations.  We can recognise people like Ms Murray and her family who have made such a great contribution. <br \/> Senator O'Keeffe made a point about the roadshow.  We will do the same for the 1916 commemoration, which would be very important.  It has proven to be very successful for the World War 1 commemoration.<\/p><p>  Senator Norris is not present.  Our approach to this decade of commemorations will be one of tolerance, respect and inclusiveness.  As Senator O'Sullivan noted, in 1966 we were boisterous.  We wanted to make a statement that we had arrived as a nation.  At this stage we are more confident as a country and have established ourselves in the world order.  We are highly respected.  We can stand back now, therefore, and have a different approach.<\/p><p>  I agree with  Senator Sean Barrett about the role of Redmond, Parnell and O'Connell.  Redmond, in particular, has been an unfortunate figure in Irish history and has been somewhat airbrushed from it, which is very unfair.<\/p><p>  Senator Coghlan mentioned the all-party group on commemorations.  That group is working very well and has had a large number of engagements.  The group was in place during the last Government and I was part of it at the time.  We had some very important initiatives such as the <i>Asgard <\/i>project.  The official in charge of the group is Mr. John Kennedy.  Many things are happening.  Perhaps we are not getting coverage in the newspapers.  I was rather disappointed by the Senator's tone, compared to that of everybody else.  I can give him a list of what is happening so that he can be more informed when he casts doubts on what we are trying to do in this regard.<\/p><p>  We opened a centre commemorating Thomas McDonagh only two weeks ago.  The Se&aacute;n Mac Diarmada centre in County Leitrim is going very well and is being restored.  I have an update on the Pearse Centre.  I refer to Deputy Adams.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200022#V00300","speaker":"1046"},{"type":"speech","time":1369226100,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I am sorry-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200022#V00400","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1369226100,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I will finish.

Some would even say it influenced that movement, perhaps even more than the Gaelic League.  One of the reasons Michael Collins became involved in the IRB was that he met Sam Maguire who introduced him to the organisation.

I do not know if I should read out the various amendments but I can deal with them by way of summary if Senators wish.  These are amendments Nos. 1 and 3.<\/p><p>  Section 5 of the Bill provides that the authorisation holder of a medicinal product may apply to the Irish Medicines Board to have a product added to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or to add a group to the list of interchangeable medicinal products.  It sets out that the board shall have 180 days to make decisions on such applications and allows the board to request further information from the authorisation holder if necessary.  As originally drafted, the 180 day period did not begin to run until such time as this additional information was provided.  In addition, section 18 provides that a supplier of an item may make an application to the HSE seeking the inclusion of a product on the list of reimbursable items.  The HSE shall agree a reimbursement price with the supplier and make a final decision for inclusion on the list within 180 days.  The HSE may seek further information from the supplier as part of the application process.<\/p><p>  As originally drafted, the 180 days did not begin to run until the further information requested was supplied.  This was not fully in compliance with article 6 of Council Directive 89\/105\/EEC relating to the transparency of measures regulating the pricing of medicinal products.  Article 6 of the directive provides for the suspension of time limits pending receipt of additional information rather than setting the clock back at zero.  This article must be interpreted as applying to any decision influencing the amount of coverage by reimbursement systems, including decisions on reference groups or groups of interchangeable medicinal products as well as pricing decisions.<\/p><p>  Sections 5(3)(<i>b<\/i>) and 18(3)(<i>b<\/i>) were amended to provide for a clock stopping arrangement so that decisions on interchangeability and reimbursement are taken within a total timeframe of 180 days.  This means that if additional information is sought on day 49, for example, the clock will begin to run again at day 50 on receipt of the information.  The amendments bring these sections into line with the transparency directive as indicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200023#W00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1369226700,"counter":306,"content":"<p>One wonders about the timeframe as there is the potential for the 180 days to be on the never-never.  If we consider the 420 modules and the drugs to be considered in the fullness of time, we will begin with the 20 most used, taking a cumulative six months to assess whether a drug will be on the list.  There is no doubt it is in the interest of Pfizer, Abbott and others to object to it and it is safe to assume the fullness of the 180 days will be called upon by them with any delay tactics that the companies wish to apply.<\/p><p>If one module takes six months, for the first 20 we will be talking about ten years before generics will be available.  In this country there is 20% generic usage and 80% non-generic usage.  In the UK, the usage statistics are the other way around, saving people millions of pounds.  There has been an indication that we will save &euro;200 million over four years because of a new agreement on branded medicines but the timeframes in the Bill are nonetheless ridiculously long.  In many ways it is not about this legislation but about what happens next.  When will the top 20 medicines be fully interchangeable?  Will it take ten years or longer, given the old rugby approach of stopping the clock when there are dissenters, as will happen?<\/p><p>I have a point on reference pricing but I must be specific to these amendments.  There is a concern about whether we are approaching the matter in terms of real change as quickly as possible or whether we are appeasing those behind directives in the EU and the IMF by saying we have legislation in place, although it will be absolutely unenforceable in bringing about real savings and a supply of pharmaceutical products to people as quickly and cheaply as possible.  The never-ending approach seems to have more of a hand for the branded sectors than the generic products in the field.<\/p><p>One wonders when generic producers will be cleared to be on the interchangeable list.  I am told it can take six to 12 months before producers can be in a position to supply the market.  We are talking about 180 days to be added to that six to 12 months, notwithstanding stopping the clock in between.  Will the Minister of State give a genuine indication of when the top 20 medicines will be fully interchangeable.  I am not trying to take a negative interpretation but I am playing devil's advocate.  It seems it could take ten years at a minimum for those 20 medicines to be fully interchangeable and available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200023#W00300","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1369226700,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his explanation.

The purpose of section 15 of the Bill is to ensure that requirements regarding generic substitution do not affect a pharmacist's discretion not to dispense a medicinal product.  As originally drafted, section 15 was explicit in its expectation that the pharmacist's professional opinion will inform the decision to dispense or not on the grounds of the health of the patient.  However, in practice under the current regulatory regime, one of the most common scenarios in which a pharmacist might refuse to dispense a prescription is where the pharmacist has a concern that the person presenting the prescription may be planning to sell or supply the medicines to other individuals or on the street.  In this case the pharmacist would usually refuse to dispense the prescription not necessarily on the basis of a concern for the health of the person named on the prescription but on the basis of concern for the safety of others and the integrity of the supply chain.<\/p> <p>The pharmacy regulator, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, expressed concern that the scope of section 15 be broadened to explicitly provide that a pharmacist would also not dispense a prescription if the pharmacist had a genuine concern that dispensing it might put others at risk.  Section 15 was, therefore, amended to broaden its scope to take into account the pharmacist's obligation not to dispense a medicine on a prescription on the basis that it may cause harm to the health of the patient named on the prescription or the health and safety of any member of the public.

I am satisfied this amendment is necessary, given the difficulties experienced by some countries in securing an adequate supply of necessary medicinal products following price reductions.  This amendment brings section 21 into line with section 24, which already provides that the HSE must have regard to this criterion when setting a reference price for a group of interchangeable medicinal products.

To comment generally on this matter, it is also interesting that the recent survey by the National Consumer Agency, NCA, is frightening in that there is a huge variation in what pharmacies are charging.  In one case the lowest price for a drug was &euro;16.62 while the highest price was &euro;49.69 for the same quantity, a difference of 199%.  There is quite a variation between different areas of the country, in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  That survey raises the issue about whether people are aware they can move pharmacy and get better value.<\/p><p>A major concern is that where somebody who has no medical card is having to buy medication with a total cost in excess of &euro;144, only the receipt for &euro;144 is being furnished to them, not a full breakdown of the cost of medication.  For instance, if the total cost of medication for the month is &euro;500 they are not given the cost of that.  I am extremely concerned, in particular with the price variation in that regard.  The people who are not on medical cards are all taxpayers.  They are entitled to get full details on what the taxpayer is having to pay.  The first &euro;144 is not refundable but anything over &euro;144 is being paid by the taxpayer and this is one of the reasons we have allowed the cost of medication to go so high, because of lack of accountability.<\/p><p>I have also raised the issue of the cost of medication in hospitals.  We need to visit this issue.  We still have a very high cost of medication in hospitals.  We should be able to do a lot more regarding getting medication at far better value for money compared to what we are getting now.  It is a huge bill on our health service.  It has not reduced to any substantial degree in the past five years.  I accept the Department has done some work on this matter and that there will be savings over the next three years but we have not made enough progress in this regard.<\/p><p>The misinformation out there on generic drugs needs to be clarified.  There is a clear provision in the legislation.  The chief medical officer of one hospital contacted me in the past two weeks to express concern about this Bill.<\/p> <p>When there is a concern that one cannot transfer from a branded product to a generic product, because of the particular level of care a patient requires, he was not aware that provision was available to him.  I found that very strange.  It was another public representative who referred him to me and I was able to refer him to the section of the Bill and gave him a copy of the Bill, as recently as two weeks ago.  The amount of medication the particular unit would prescribe would be high because of the type of patient being dealt with.  It is extremely important that we get information out to general practitioners and also to people who are involved in the management of the drugs programmes within hospitals.  The Department and the HSE have a major role to play in getting that information out and that people are accountable on that issue.

I want them all wound out so far as they are there and I want an end to one of the Pat Kenny themes.  He is always saying these drugs are far cheaper in Spain.  I get material from the industry stating that Ireland is in a different zone from Spain.  I do not go along with that.  We are in a free trade area in the European Union and there should not be any of these agreements and they should not be binding on the Department.  I say &quot;More power to the Minister of State&quot; to go out and buy at the best price possible, including bringing truckloads of them back from Spain if Pat Kenny tells us they are much cheaper there.  I would appreciate the Minister of State's note on that section.<\/p><p>  It is strange that paragraph (<i>g<\/i> ) in section 21 and paragraph (<i>f<\/i> ) in section 24 were introduced as amendments.  I am trying to think whether the pharmaceutical industry has some friends in the D&aacute;il who tabled the amendments because they certainly were not in the spirit of what the Seanad wanted.  We were trying to empower the Minister to tackle the problem of a very high cost health service, the estimates for which are the second highest in the world, after the United States.  What is the purpose of those two paragraphs because they appear to go against the spirit of what we and the Minister of State have been trying to do?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200025#Y00800","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1369227900,"counter":335,"content":"<p>May I first address the points raised by Senators Marc MacSharry and Colm Burke?  In regard to the timescales expected, my advice is that we can expect to see movement within two to three months of the signing into law of this Bill by the President which I hope will happen in a matter of a short number of weeks.  I would expect that upon enactment, it will take two to three months for the Irish Medicines Board to get going on this work.  I have met the Irish Medicines Board which is well geared up for this work.  In response to my queries, along the lines raised by Senator MacSharry, it assured me it has sufficient staffing to engage in this important work that we all want to see happening.  I would have no concerns in that regard.  Certainly it was reasonable to raise that issue and it could be raised again if it were to be an issue in the short or medium term but I do not expect that it will.<\/p><p>I expect that work will be taken up immediately and that we could see some results within two to three months.  We have the list of 20 which we have published or, at least, read into the record or the particular lists of drugs, with which the Irish Medicines Board will start.   I am reluctant to pinpoint a date for a reference price but if matters proceed as we expect, in terms of the enactment of the legislation within the next few weeks, October or November is not an unreasonable target for that to occur.<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke raised the legitimate public concern in respect of the variations in prices.  Senator Barrett mentioned the comparators internationally.  Senator Burke also made the point in terms of the variation that has been shown to exist internally in the State.  It is an issue of concern.  The enactment of the legislation which is crucially important will not just introduce generic substitution and reference pricing but will also change the culture of our approach to the price of medicines.  This should have application across the board.  There should be strong public dissemination of information and encouragement of people to use, where appropriate, generic medicines where recommended and where the Irish Medicines Board is satisfied that they have the same efficacy as the branded product.  A clear set of criteria are set out in the Bill for the Irish Medicines Board to apply.  I hope and expect this will change our whole approach to generic medicine.<\/p><p>Senator Burke is right to emphasise the need for information flow, dissemination of information and encouragement for people to take up generic medicine.  One of the companies, this has been referred to publicly recently, Tienda, has already begun a public campaign which is being fronted by an old colleague of mine, Dr. Byrne from RTE, who is involved in the promotion of the use of generic products.  That is a good initiative and I hope others do likewise.  The law is one thing but the information flow and encouragement is a crucially important aspect. <\/p><p>In regard to Senator Burke's final point, I will have to check the phenomenon of people obtaining a prescription in the hospital and going out to the pharmacist and coming back to the hospital.<\/p> <p>That is something that I would need to understand a little better.  I shall check it out and revert to the Senator on the matter.  I was not aware of it myself.  <\/p><p> I agree with Senator Colm Burke and others who made a point about transparency, in general.  As Senators will be aware, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland is the regulator.  Its code of conduct requires pharmacists to: &quot;provide honest, relevant, accurate, current and appropriate information to patients regarding the nature, cost, value and benefit of medicines provided by them.  Every pharmacist has an obligation to comply in full with the statutory Code of Conduct&quot;.  The PSI advises patients that their pharmacists should be in a position to provide them with whatever information or clarification they require about prescribed medicines, including information about the pricing of those medicines.  The PSI is examining options to achieve greater price transparency for patients.  The HSE reimburses pharmacists for products dispensed under the General Medical Services and other community drug schemes, including the drug payment scheme, referred to Senator Colm Burke, in accordance with the rates set out in its list of reimbursable items.  The community pharmacy contractor agreement sets out the duties of pharmacists supplying medicines to patients under the GMS and the community drug schemes.  It is the view of the HSE and the Department of Health that there should be total transparency provided when any pharmaceutical service is accessed by a member of the public.  The HSE will continue to raise the issue with the Irish Pharmacy Union as part of the current project to enhance between pharmacy computer systems and the State.<\/p><p> I thank Senator Barrett for mentioning reference prices.  The fundamental issue to grasp and be reassured by is that the reference price will be set by the HSE, irrespective of any deals that may have been done.  The related amendment and section talks about a list of items that regard must be had for and that is the decisive aspect.  The HSE will set the reference price in accordance with the rules and principles set out in the Act.  It will not be set by any other body.  It will not be set by public or private deals.  Regard must be given to a number of matters.  As section 21(5) states: <blockquote>(<i>d<\/i>) the potential budget impact of the item if it were to become a listed item,<br \/>(<i>e<\/i>) the ability of suppliers of the item to meet patient demand for the item if it were to become a listed item,<br \/>(<i>f<\/i>) the resources available to the Executive, and<br \/>(<i>g<\/i>) the terms of any agreement in place (whether entered into before, on or after the commencement of this section) between the Executive and any representative body of the suppliers of drugs, medicines or medicinal or surgical appliances where the agreement relates, whether directly or indirectly, to the price of the item.<\/blockquote>A reference price will be set but regard must be had for any existing deal or &quot;any agreement in place.&quot;  It is not unreasonable to require that to be one of the items that regard has to be had to.  I wish to emphasise again, to the Senator and to the House, that the HSE will set the reference price in accordance with the principles set out in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200025#Y00900","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369228500,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200026#Z00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1369228500,"counter":338,"content":"<p>The Senator can do that at the end of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200026#Z00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1369228500,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1369228500,"counter":340,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take the next Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200026#Z00500","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1369228500,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200026#Z00600","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1369228500,"counter":342,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I was concerned about the traditional agreements of the kind that the Department is trying to correct.  His sentiments and ambitions for the Bill all go in the right direction.<\/p><p>I note that the legislation, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill, contains a general wish to curb medical inflation, which we support.  There is also a problem with services.  I have heard claims that tests, scans, etc., cost far more in Ireland than in other countries.  The Milliman report expressed concern, some of which were mentioned by Senator Colm Burke, about people staying in hospital too long at a cost of &euro;1,000 per night which adds to the State's bill.  There is also over prescribing and a lack of awareness about general costs.  Many economists who have examined the legislation think that reducing costs would be the real function of the competitive health insurance business which the Department is trying to develop as part of the Government's plan.  One should not assume that company A charged less for health insurance because it did not insure old people.  Perhaps it followed the Department's advice on drugs.  It shopped around for low cost locations to provide scans and tests.  Perhaps tests were conducted during normal hours so not to incur overtime rates.  When I worked on the Brennan commission I discovered that some tests were deliberately delayed and scheduled for when overtime was available.  Perhaps an insurance company, on behalf of the Minister, could better police how services are provided and thus provide cheaper health insurance.  I know that the Minister of State is attempting to control the budget but the measure would lift a great weight off the Department's shoulders.<\/p><p>What we have done today regarding medical goods should be applied to services.  Market mechanisms that can extract a similar gain from excess costs should be implemented.  We have a high cost system so we should examine excessive stays in hospitals, excessive prescribing and excessively costly procedures.  Perhaps, as part of the Croke Park agreement, we could ensure that procedures are carried out during normal hours so as not to incur overtime rates, reduce high costs and reduce waiting lists.  The health service still has many critics and has not met the goals set by us.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200026#Z00900","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1369228500,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I need clarification on a few points but I know that he may not be able to provide that today.  We should change the guidelines covering drugs that cost over &euro;140 per month.<\/p><p>The Danes have introduced a patient medication card system.  The card is the size of a visa card and prescriptions no longer need to be handed out.  A GP can access a file using the card and return it to the patient.  A pharmacy can also access the patient's file using the card.  Therefore, no mistakes are made and relevant information is available to the pharmacist.  As much as 27% of all prescriptions written by hospital doctors cannot be understood or are misunderstood.  By the end of the year, 48% of the population will have a GP card or a medical card so we should be able to computerise the system and adopt the Danish system.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200026#Z01000","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1369228500,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their participation and contribution to the debate.  I also thank them for their helpful insights into the relatively small number of issues that we have dealt with today.  Last autumn the Seanad dealt with the Bill and Senators made a very helpful input.  Today, the amendments have returned from the D&aacute;il and the contributions have been helpful and very much on point.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Barrett's call to reduce costs, where we can, across the system.  The Bill is a very important initiative on medicines and reminds us of the necessity to reduce costs, where possible.  As the Senator said, that aim is not confined to the area of medicines and suggested that we reduce the cost of services.  We should be preoccupied with that aim.<\/p><p>I take Senator Barrett's point on the broader issue of health insurance, what insurance companies can achieve and the contribution that they can make to reduce costs.  We are faced with an enormous challenge.  I know that we describe everything in the health service as a challenge.  It must be acknowledged that many great things are happening in the health services all the time.  There are challenges because of medical inflation.  The cost of procedures are genuinely increasing but in other cases one must wonder how the cost is configured.  Questions must be asked, and will continue to be asked, about cost structures and are being addressed.  The Department will redouble its efforts in that regard.  I thank Senator Barrett for his assistance and contributions.<\/p> <p> Equally, I thank Senator Colm Burke.  I agree with his emphasis on the IT dimension to this and what can be achieved.  We can see it in other countries.  I have had an opportunity to study what happens in other comparable countries.  One development the Government wants to see is the introduction of a unique patient identifier which would put the management of data and efficiencies in the system right at the heart of what we are doing.  We must press on with that.  Our plan is to introduce legislation later this year which will provide for a unique patient identifier, which I hope could then be deployed and used right across the entire system, not least in the area of prescriptions and prescribing, but also right across all of the management of the health services.  In primary care, it would be crucial to have that.<\/p><p>I remind the House that the programme for Government includes a commitment that: &quot;Reference pricing and greater use of generics will be introduced to reduce the State's large drugs bill and the cost to individuals of their medications.&quot;  That commitment in the programme for Government, I am happy to say, has been addressed and has now been achieved by the passing of this legislation in the Houses.<\/p><p>The Bill improves and updates the statutory basis for the supply of medicines and other prescribed items under the General Medical Services and community drugs schemes.  I reiterate my commitment and the commitment of the Government to maintain access to new medicines for Irish patients.  This needs to be done in the most cost-effective and efficient manner possible.<\/p><p>The core objective of the Bill is to achieve value while maintaining and improving levels of service.  In doing so, the Bill will introduce a system of reference pricing and generic substitution for prescribed drugs and medicines which will ultimately lead to savings for taxpayers and patients.<\/p><p>I again thank the Senators for their constructive input to the debate on this Bill.  I assure them that, as always, the Government has carefully considered all of the issues and concerns that have been raised during the course of the debate in the House last autumn when the Seanad first addressed this Bill and today, and also by Deputies in the Lower House.  I am satisfied that the provisions of the Bill address the concerns raised by Members of both Houses.  To reference back to Senator MacSharry's point, I will keep the implementation of reference pricing and generic substitution under constant review, as I am sure Members of the House will also.<\/p><p>I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200026#Z01100","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1369229100,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Animal Health and Welfare Bill 2012: [Seanad Bill amended by the D\u00e1il] Report and Final Stages","time":1369229100,"counter":349,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200027#AA00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1369229100,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, to the House.

The amendments are a number of small changes to section 12 that reflect a number of issues raised by Deputies.  In the main, they serve to improve the language of the section and provide that where a suffering animal is seized, the dependent offspring also can be seized.  This provision is unlikely to be used, as where animals have been mistreated, it usually is that other animals in the herd or flock have been similarly mistreated.  Amendment No. 13 allows that where an authorised officer has clear reason to believe a notice will not be complied with, he or she can seize animals.  There have been cases in which offenders have ripped up notices or made it clear they have no intention of complying with lawful direction.  This provision allows that if such a situation occurs, the authorised officer need not wait for the animals to suffer any further.  This should not be read as some form of <i>carte blanche<\/i> for authorised officers to act as they please.  If an officer is challenged in court and cannot show a genuine and compelling reason for his or her actions, then they will not stand.

If they can see that animals are being abused and mistreated and if they are dealing with someone who was being completely unreasonable and unbalanced in terms of not respecting a written direction, one must allow an authorised officer to proceed and actually seize animals.

First, if one is unable to feed one's animals at present for whatever reason, regardless of whether one cannot get them out and has no fodder to feed them inside or cannot afford to buy feed or cannot access feed, there is absolutely no reason to allow an animal to starve in Ireland at present.  There is a lo-call number on which one can contact the Department.  It will deal with such calls on a case-by-case basis and is doing this at present.  The Department is treating them confidentially and consequently, there is no loss of face in this regard.  Essentially, the Department sends out a vet to assess the situation and then it accesses and pays for emergency fodder.  The Department has now done this in many cases and has spent nearly &euro;130,000 in recent weeks feeding animals in extreme cases.  We have had more than 800 calls to that helpline, more than 300 of which have been serious.  In the case of the others, we simply have put them in contact with local co-ops and markets to enable them to access feeds.  The Department is there to help and not to punish people.  This is the first message I wish to send to farmers.<\/p><p>Second, however, in the longer term, I cannot allow a situation in which animals are not being fed.  There must be consequences if people allow their animals to starve or to become emaciated or whatever.  Consequently, this is the reason this legislation is being put in place.  If one is responsible for animals or if one owns animals, a major responsibility comes with that.  Yes, the Department is there to help but it is also there to ensure that if one ignores the structures that can help one, of course there are consequences because the Department cannot allow situations in which animals are starving only for farmers then to simply state they were sorry but could not afford to buy fodder.<\/p><p>My point is this legislation allows the Department to take action if there is wilful neglect of animals.  Equally, however, to balance that, the Department has put in place an animal welfare call line that is not a temporary measure but is a permanent facility for farmers who have difficulties for whatever reasons in respect of not being able to feed animals.  Alternatively, it may not be a question of feeding the animals but the farmers may have a concern about another insoluble issue with regard to the welfare of their animals.  There is a balance in this regard.  A support system has been put in place that can kick into action, is well-financed and does not have an expenditure ceiling.  Second, however, there is a responsibility on animal owners to use that facility or to feed their animals.  Both are necessary as otherwise, one contributes to an animal welfare, which is not the purpose of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200028#BB00900","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1369229700,"counter":369,"content":"<p>The subject matter of the eighth group is amendment No. 16.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200028#BB01000","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1369229700,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 16 stands alone in the eighth group and is about the prohibition on abandonment of animals.

It pertains to the prohibition on animal fighting.  Amendments Nos. 17 to 20 are to section 15.  There has been some concern over section 15 of the Bill, despite the fact that it relates clearly to performances.  I have had this section re-examined and am satisfied this provision will not be used as a basis for prosecutions against either farmers or educators.<\/p><p>It has been suggested that I should add a clause making it clear that normal farming practice is not covered by the section.  Aside from the difficulty with defining normal farming practice, there is the added problem that were I to specify this was not covered, I would be obliged to similarly allow for every other legitimate activity, which might involve animals from riding schools to sporting events to even walking a dog in terms of the actual legal definition.  Obviously, this list would never be complete and would therefore be pointless.<\/p> <p> However, we made a few amendments on Committee Stage.  Amendment No. 17 makes clear that performances with an untrained bovine rather than merely a bull are covered.  That addresses a concern that unscrupulous operators could use freshly castrated bullocks to circumvent the ban on such performances.  Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 were introduced to clarify the situation for a lawful investigative purpose to justify filming an animal fighting event or to show said material afterwards.  That is not particularly well written but, essentially, what it means is that not only is it unlawful to organise, participate in or attend a dog fight, cock fight or other such fight, but it is also unlawful to film it and to put it online to make money from it.<\/p><p>I also proposed a minor amendment No. 20 on the roping of horses.  As currently worded, performances involving that activity are banned where they cause suffering.  However, there are specialists who carry out the activity in a humane and non-coercive fashion and my amendment proposes to allow such an activity where no unnecessary suffering is caused.  I refer in other words to a horse whisperer situation where one is breaking an animal using unconventional but proven methods, for example, the work of Monty Roberts.  That type of performance should not be banned by the legislation when there is a proven beneficial effect on animals and is a humane way to break a horse if it is done properly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200028#BB01300","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369230300,"counter":374,"content":"<p>We now move to group 10, amendments Nos. 21 and 55.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200029#CC00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1369230300,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Group 10 relates to operations and procedures.

There was much discussion about section 16, mainly concerning tail docking and exceptions for so-called working dogs.  I have opted for a ban on tail docking for cosmetic purposes.  However, there is still some compelling scientific research both available and pending and the balance of evidence seems to indicate that while some working dogs will avoid tail injuries from preventative tail docking, the number is small compared to the number who suffer from side effects associated with preventative tail docking.  I suggest that those who think they are protecting the welfare of working dogs by having their tails docked should consider the research carefully.<\/p><p>The amendment to section 52 is to ensure the correct cross-reference to a subsection in section 16 is in place.  In other words, what we are saying on tail docking is that the onus will be on the owner to prove there is a requirement to dock the tail of a dog.  We are banning tail docking for all cosmetic purposes but we can deal with that through regulation at a later stage in conjunction with the bodies concerned with working dogs.  I need to be convinced that tail docking is necessary.  There is ongoing research, in particular in a university in Scotland at the moment on the issue of whether working dogs benefit from tail docking.  We do not want the situation to arise whereby the tails of working dogs are mutilated and damaged severely by not having them docked.

Cats are an unusual animal in that they are semi-domesticated in many ways.  They become a protected animal if they are owned by a person but, essentially, for the purposes of the Bill they are considered a wild animal if they are not owned.  On many farmyards one has cats living in the yard who are essentially protected animals because they are owned by someone but they behave in a pretty wild manner in terms of ratting and such behaviour.<\/p><p>We cannot treat feral cats as protected animals because we are then going down a road whereby we would be unable to control and implement the regulations because there are no owners to prosecute, take to court or to whom we could issue a welfare notice.  We must be sensible and we must do a lot of other things to deal with the feral cat population such as catching, neutering and releasing.  That is already the case in work done by many animal welfare organisations.  We must do more such work and perhaps help to financially support the programme.  We are encouraging that through our code of practice, that we are requiring of all the animal welfare bodies that we financially support.  However, one cannot apply the same level of protection to a wild animal as a protected animal because it is so difficult to enforce.  Whereas there is an onus on landowners in terms of wild animals and protected animals to be mindful of said protection when laying poison, we are somewhat limited in what we can do for wild animals because they are far less predictable.<\/p><p>In terms of the laying of poison, it is necessary that a notice or notices of the laying of poison upon the land shall be so that at least one notice is clearly visible from every public place adjoining or being upon the land.  In other words, one has to be able to see the notice regardless of the way one enters the land.  The notice must be up on a gate or otherwise visible.  It is not necessarily limited to one notice.  If there are multiple entrances or access points to land my understanding is that they must all be clearly marked. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200029#CC00700","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1369230300,"counter":380,"content":"<p>We will now discuss group 12, amendments Nos. 26, 27 and 56.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200029#CC00800","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1369230300,"counter":381,"content":"<p>This was a particularly sensitive issue.

For example, if I adopt a code saying a fully grown male pig needs five to seven litres of water per day, this merely illustrates how one might comply with the provision in section 13 that an animal keeper must provide sufficient quality of feed and water.

There were concerns about compensation where animals are destroyed for disease purposes.  These were based on a misreading of the current legal situation.  The provisions in the Animal Health and Welfare Bill do not make any change to the meaning of the 1966 Act but make the language clearer.  The provisions are in line with established case law and the constitutional protection of property.  While in the 1966 Act use of the term \"shall\" at one point is qualified by the term \"may\" and compensation under the Act is dependent on agreement by the Minister for Finance, currently the ERAD scheme operates without any legal requirement on the Government to pay compensation but the Government pays nevertheless and will continue to pay fair compensation.<\/p><p>When it comes to eradication of widespread endemic diseases, this approach is an important policy plant to ensure compliance with the scheme.

The issue is that we will not move away from the current approach, be it towards TB or other diseases we want to eradicate.

The amendment is intended to make clear that the authorisation to issue the fixed penalty notice is separate from the general authorised officer provisions of the legislation.  The Bill provides adequate checks and balances and I am satisfied it will not be possible for what could be described as a \"trigger happy\" officer to issue spurious on-the-spot fines.<\/p><p>I will elaborate a little on this matter as it gave rise to concerns in the earlier debate in the House.  We have amended the section to provide that a fixed penalty notice cannot be issued by one officer acting alone.  Instead, an officer who wishes to issue a fixed penalty notice must first obtain the authorisation of a second officer in a divisional veterinary office or local authority.  As such, it will not be possible for fixed penalty notices to be issued in a trigger happy manner.  The approval of a second officer must be sought before an officer may issue fixed penalty notices, which are essentially a slap on the wrist for individuals who have been responsible for minor offences.  No one wants to take people to court for such offences, unless absolutely necessary.  It is important, therefore, that officers have available to them a penalty that equates to an on-the-spot fine.  The amendment introduces a check on the initial proposal by providing that a second authorised officer must sanction a fixed penalty notice. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200031#FF01300","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1369232100,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's response and clarification because this is an issue which has caused concern.

What is being proposed probably makes sense in that no one officer can make the decision.  It has to go up the line for a second opinion.  Am I right in understanding the amendment to mean that a second officer would have to agree with the initial report or recommendation from the primary officer?  If that it is correct, it would at least give some level of comfort.<\/p><p>I am also concerned about the level of fines being imposed.  This Bill is very similar to road traffic legislation whereby an administrative penalty of up to &euro;1,000 can be imposed.  Constitutionally, that is the position.  I have worked in conjunction with Senator O'Donovan on other legislation, which I hope the Minister will see fit to support when it comes before the House, on the decriminalisation of fisheries offences, for which we are proposing administrative sanctions.  I would not be averse to supporting administrative sanctions in this instance.  They constitute a slap across the wrist and mean that the individual farmer or herd owner will not end up in court, facing prosecution and a criminal conviction.  It makes sense but I understand the level of the fines will be fixed by way of regulation.  In that context, it would make sense that the cap would be placed at a level that is not excessive.  Perhaps there should be a lower cap for a first offence with a gradual increase for any subsequent offences.  The purpose of administrative sanctions or penalties is to discourage certain practices.  The idea is to disincentivise the practice that is occurring, and if that is the rationale behind this, I will support it.  I am glad to see the imposition of sanctions will not be at the whim of one inspector or officer.  Any such decision will have to go up the line, which I welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200032#GG00300","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1369232100,"counter":407,"content":"<p>That is exactly what is happening.

Therefore, there is now a safeguard in place that states that such a charge cannot be bigger than the cost of the service to which it relates.  This seems like a reasonable approach.  It should be stressed that the reality is that the majority of services provided by the State to the agricultural sector, such as inspection of animals or laboratory tests, are provided free of charge or for charges which are far lower than the actual cost of such services.  Essentially, the Bill provides that the Department must provide services at cost and cannot charge for profit.  No future Minister can impose a charge which includes a profit.  Any service the Department provides, such as inspections, for which there is a charge, the charge cannot be higher than the cost of delivering the service, which is sensible.  There is no intention to increase charges from my perspective.  If charges are to be introduced or increased, that will have to be discussed and negotiated with the relevant stakeholders.

The original draft of this legislation was put in place by the previous Government.  It has been amended, changed and modernised, as appropriate, by this Government, but the same people in my Department have been involved in making it happen, namely, Mr. Mark Winkelman, Mr. Dermot Murphy and Mr. John Moloney.

There are some people who should not have animals and we need to intervene to protect those animals.  We will have a lot more power and a lot more legal clarity with the enactment of this legislation, and not before time, in my opinion.

While some of the amendments we initially proposed may not have been 100% correct, the Minister acknowledged our intent, went back, made amendments in the D&aacute;il and the officials worked overtime on it.  This is substantial legislation as it crosses over a multitude of legislation in the Department.  It deals with every animal in the country, each of which has a right to be protected and the Bill does that.<\/p><p>Obviously farmers had genuine concerns.  We needed to marry those genuine concerns with the greater good of protecting animals.  That has been achieved in the best possible manner.  I thank the Minister for his co-operation.

The fodder crisis began this time last year because we really had no summer from June onwards.  Parts of west and north County Cork, and County Kerry had only three days without rain from the start of June to the end of August.  It was an extraordinary weather pattern that then continued to be hampered by the early onset of winter and the late arrival of spring.  The result has been a significant shortage of fodder in parts of the country.<\/p><p>Even though we have been working with farmers through Teagasc, private advisers and others to try to extend the use of limited fodder for many dairy and beef herds for longer than would normally be used through winter, everybody had anticipated that we would have some kind of normal weather patterns after St. Patrick's Day, but that simply did not happen.  We then moved into a crisis management situation where farms literally ran out of all fodder.  While some accessed it from their neighbours for a period, eventually that ran out also.  It quickly became clear that we would need to import very large volumes from abroad, which had never happened previously.<\/p><p>On 24 April I announced that we would essentially pay for the majority of the cost of transporting from the UK.  I committed &euro;1 million representing 1,000 truckloads.  We have subsequently extended the scheme's deadline and have doubled the fund.  The scheme ends on Friday but we have said we will extend it until Friday week on the basis of deliveries.  However, we need clear indications from co-operatives, marts and others that are approved to import and avail of the transport subsidy - the Department has now approved many of them - of proof of purchase before Friday, but the delivery can take place into next week.  The reason for that is as follows.  We could take the option of simply extending each week resulting essentially in a drip feed of hay coming in each week as long as it is needed.<\/p> <p>Instead we need to put pressure on organisations, co-operatives, marts and those importing to bring in a lot of fodder in a short time.  In sticking to this Friday's deadline and extending the delivery period until end May, we are doing so.  People understand the reason we are making that choice.  As we move into June, we need to concentrate on the provision of our own fodder, if possible.  If weather does not permit this, we will have to review the situation.<\/p><p>As of yesterday, some 2,158 loads of fodder have been contracted by dairy co-operatives, co-operatives and marts, 419 of which have yet to be delivered.  To put this into context, this equates to more than 40,000 tonnes of fodder, which is enough fodder to feed between 5 million and 6 million animals for a day.  This has been a mammoth task logistically over the past four weeks or so, which has resulted in huge volumes of, primarily, hay but also maize in the case of Glanbia, imported into Ireland.  However, there are areas that continue to suffer and are unable to access as much fodder as they would like.  In counties such as Leitrim, Roscommon and in parts of Mayo there are queues for the small numbers of bales available.  We are in contact on a daily, and often hourly, basis with co-operatives such as Connacht Gold and others to try to get hay to where it is needed and with other co-operatives such as Dairygold, Glanbia and so on to try to compensate where there are real shortages.  This work is ongoing.  A lot of hay will continue to come into the country between now and the end of the week and into next week.  I understand Dairygold will bring a shipload of fodder into Ireland.  However, this has not been confirmed.  <\/p><p>This is about not only feeding the crisis but allowing farmers, as an insurance mechanism lest this summer is the same as last summer, to get fodder into storage.  We must plan for such a nightmare situation.  We will continue to keep the pressure on in terms in bringing in large volumes of fodder and assisting where we can.  For example, the head of the Irish Road Hauliers Association has been very helpful.  Connacht Gold had a problem sourcing trucks and the Irish Road Hauliers Association has linked up with it to bring in large volumes of fodder, particularly to the west and north west of Ireland, including Donegal, which was hit badly last Saturday by very heavy rain.  While in comparison to other parts of the country Donegal did not experience particularly high rainfall last summer, it is experiencing it now.  <\/p><p>In terms of the emergency welfare line, I have consistently said that there is no reason any animal should starve, regardless of the availability of fodder.  If a farmer is in crisis and is unable to afford to feed his or her animals or cannot access hay or silage he or she should contact my Department and we will help.  The Department has responded to approximately 800 calls during the past month.  It has helped in approximately 300 emergency situations and has put others in contact with co-operatives from whom they can obtain feed.  More than &euro;130,000 has been spent on getting hay into farmyards to ensure animals get the feed they need.  We will continue to do this.  This scheme will not close any time over the summer or next winter for that matter.  The animal welfare helpline will remain open and the Department will remain supportive and discreet in terms of how it assists farmers so that there is no loss of face.  This is about feeding and supporting animals.  I would encourage farmers to avail of what is in place.<\/p><p>On mortality, there has been much talk about numbers reaching epidemic proportions and so on.  It is important to put this into perspective.  We do have a high mortality rate this year as compared with last year.  Thus far, approximately 152,000 animals have died on farms this year as compared with 116,000 this time last year.  It is important to put this into perspective.  It amounts to a little more than one animal per farm.  It is also important to note that we have a 3.5% increase in calving rates this year.  There will always be some mortality during calving.  The real problem is not that there are animals starving in fields - if there are we need to know about them and deal with it - but that animals are being housed at a time when they would normally be out, which has contributed to the spread of disease and other disease threats to which animals would not normally be exposed this time of year because they would be out in the fields in the fresh air.  A series of things have led to the increase in mortality.  It is important to put this into perspective so that people understand the reasoning behind it.<\/p><p>On farm payments, we are ahead in terms of access to payments around REPS 4.  Some &euro;167 million has been paid out thus far under that scheme, &euro;35 million of which was paid out in 2013.  Agri-environment option scheme, AEOS, payments are almost all paid.  More than &euro;3 million has been paid out during the past two weeks to farmers.  We want to get as much cash out to farmers as we can, given their financial concerns.  Discussions are ongoing with the banks and co-operatives in regard to making credit available.  We are seeking interest-free credit for fertiliser purchases from the co-operatives in an effort to ensure grass growth as the land begins to dry out.  Again, practically all of the co-operatives have responded positively to this request.  <\/p><p>In terms of accessing an EU solidarity fund, we have pushed for this with the Commission.  However, it is not a runner.  While I do not have time now to go into the reasons for this they have been set out in detail today in the journal, which members can read tomorrow.  If we could access this funding, we would do so.  The fund is used specifically in relation to natural disasters and to compensate states in respect of the clean-up following natural disasters rather than to provide funding to individual farmers or private businesses.  The fund is not, unfortunately, designed for what we are experiencing.  <\/p><p>The real challenge for us now, apart from getting fodder to the parts of the country where it is needed, is to ensure that this does not happen again next winter.  That is very challenging.  We need to find a way of getting enough fodder into storage to ensure we do not have a repeat of this crisis, which would be very expensive for us to deal with next winter and spring.  I am pleased to inform the House that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and I today announced a temporary and targeted adjustment to two provisions of the nitrates regulations to support additional fodder production on Irish farms in the coming months.  Essentially, we are extending by two weeks the periods during which farmers may spread fertiliser, thus extending the grazing season and, hopefully, getting a late cut of silage that normally would not be even considered by farmers because they would already have sufficient fodder in storage at this time.  We are also addressing the phosphorous issue.  As herds have been fed a great deal more meal than normal, this will have consequences in terms of the nitrates action plan and directive.  We are also seeking some flexibility in this area.<\/p><p>We are dealing as best we can with the immediate crisis in terms of having established a low-call emergency helpline for farmers and continuing to subsidise the importation of large volumes of fodder.  We are bringing a great deal of pressure to bear on bringing in as much fodder as is feasible and practicable.  We are also doing a great deal of work with Teagasc to plan for the medium to long term issues around fodder.  I cannot recall it ever being the case that farmers across the country have had no fodder in storage, with some few exceptions, while at the same time the grazing season in wet areas was four to six weeks behind and in better areas was two or three weeks behind in terms of normal growth patterns.  We are under real pressure.  The system is being tested.  In my view, we have the capacity to respond to this positively and to ensure that we get enough fodder into storage for next winter.  I am confident that we can do this, but it will not happen by itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200033#HH00900","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369233300,"counter":431,"content":"<p>  Question put and agreed to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200034#JJ00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1369233300,"counter":432,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.50 p.m. and resumed at 5 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Criminal Justice (Unlicensed Money-Lending) Bill 2013: Second Stage","time":1369233900,"counter":433,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200035#LL00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1369233900,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200035#LL00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1369233900,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for taking the time to come into the House.  As he is no doubt aware, illegal moneylending is an increasing scourge on our society.  Unfortunately, the crime figures do not bear that out because, as the Minister is all too aware, there has never been a conviction for illegal moneylending in Ireland.  There is a great deal of law governing this area but, unfortunately, its victims are not sufficiently protected in terms of coming forward and giving evidence against the accused when the accused, or agents of same, is likely to be in a position to intimidate them on their way out of the courthouse or elsewhere.<\/p><p>In terms of legislation, unlicensed moneylending is mentioned in the Consumer Credit Act.  The penalties include up to five years imprisonment as well as fines.  The offences perpetrated in terms of the criminality involved and the methods of collection these people use are governed under sections 10 and 11 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.  While there have been many convictions under those sections of those Bills, it is not possible to say specifically the crimes to which they were related, although it is certain, from the Minister's responses to parliamentary questions in the other House, that there have not been any convictions for this particular crime.<\/p><p>The situation is exacerbated in a recession where there is a need for social finance in our new regulatory regime.  People are being forced in the first instance into the hands of Provident plc and other such lending institutions which, strangely, can legally charge up to 200% and employ questionable methods of collection activities in terms of the persistence with which they contact people and so on.  They are the lender of last resort in terms of officialdom, and when people cannot make those payments, they are forced into the hands of the illegal moneylenders.  Many of them are involved in serious criminality throughout the country, including intimidation and violence and in terms of the persistence with which they threaten people and vary the principal people owe rather than simply applying interest rates, however high they may be.<\/p> <p>It also seems from discussions with garda&iacute;, community groups and those trying to prevent this particular crime that the perpetrators are well-known but we do not have the evidence to convict them.  The victims are people preparing for children to go back to school or those with the expense of a first holy communion, a family wedding, schoolbooks, children going to college, an electricity bill or simply putting food on the table.  As we know anecdotally from our clinics these are real problems people have on a daily basis.  They go to these moneylenders and then suffer serious consequences.<\/p><p>I must mention Communities Against Illegal Lending of Money, CAILM, in Sligo which has done significant work on creating awareness on the issue and encouraging alternatives such as community banks where people save over a period of time.  Cranmore, which is a large estate in Sligo, has the Cranmore community bank which works very well.  CAILM takes a three tiered approach encompassing prevention, alternatives and enforcement.  It also educates through telling people where they can go for social finance.  We are falling down when it comes to enforcement.  I am aware of two cases in the north west where files were sent to the DPP but, as with many other cases, the victims did not come forward as they did not have enough confidence in the system to protect them.  On summary conviction one faces quite a small fine and or a maximum prison sentence of 12 months.  I do not believe any cases have been heard on indictment but in such a case the maximum sentence is five years in prison.<\/p><p>The Bill offers a very small spoke in the wheel to deal with these issues.  It will give additional protection to people whereby on conviction the court can hand down an order to prohibit the perpetrator and his or her agents contacting by any means the victim in an effort to get away from the intimidation and give people confidence.  The Bill also states if there is not enough evidence to convict but the judge is satisfied there is a clear issue of intimidation an order to prohibit contact can be handed down.  This is to encourage people to come forward so these moneylenders can be convicted by providing safeguards which do not exist at present.  While illegal money lending and violence against an individual are crimes, in practice the victims of this particular crime fall between two stools.  This is a small advancement.  It is non-adversarial and could be embraced by the Government.<\/p><p>The tradition, certainly for members of Fianna F&aacute;il, is that Private Members' motions do not tend to be accepted, for no other reason than they are Fianna F&aacute;il motions.  The Independent Senators enjoy better success in this regard, as it seems more palatable for the Government of the day to accept their Bills on Second Stage.  This is not a criticism exclusively of the current Government nor is it an absolution for previous governments which had the same practice.  I very much hope in the interests of groups such as CAILM - Senator O'Keeffe is well aware of its work and supports it - that we take steps in this area.  It is incumbent on us to do so.<\/p><p>Moneylenders prey on society and those who are at their most vulnerable, who are unemployed, have no money and have exhausted all avenues, perhaps including social welfare.  In the regulatory regime we now have it is increasingly more difficult for credit unions to make social finance available.  The Bill is small, and other supplementary measures would be required with regard to the delivery of social finance.  We must examine the models in the UK where its Assets Recovery Agency, Department for Work and Pensions and other agencies have come together to successfully secure approximately 100 convictions in recent years for this particular crime.<\/p><p>The Bill provides for a prison sentence of 14 years, which is a significant increase on the five year sentence which exists at present because it is not a deterrent to criminals.  As I have stated, there have been no convictions and I do not believe there will be until we can demonstrably afford additional protection to victims.  We humbly believe this is a step in this direction and we very much hope the Minister will be in a position to accept it on Second Stage and add the benefit of his party and the coalition's brilliance to enhance it further on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>This issue is predominantly urban.  Sligo is not unique and large urban centres throughout the country such as Limerick and Dublin have been affected by this crime.  I very much hope we can extend some element of hope to the victims of this crime and to society by taking this step to provide them with additional protection to ensure they are encouraged to come forward and testify against these criminals.<\/p><p>I pay tribute and thank councillor Deirdre Heney, who was very much involved in helping to draw up the legislation and in researching the existing legislation which governs this area.  The figures speak for themselves as we have had no convictions.  There is much law but no justice.  We believe this is but one small spoke in a wheel of many spokes to assist in this area.  I very much hope the Minister will be able to embrace this legislative initiative in the spirit with which it has been tabled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200035#LL00400","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369234200,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I support the constructive legislation put together by my colleague, Senator Marc MacSharry.  It is not the first time he has done so.  He has outlined many of the reasons the Bill should be accepted.  As my colleague stated, it is part of a solution and not the be all and end all.  It will not solve everything.  One of the biggest issues with regard to illegal money lending is with regard to the tactics used by some moneylenders to threaten people into paying exorbitant rates of interest.  They use physical assault, seize goods, break into property and verbally threaten.<\/p><p>The problem is increasing in these very straitened times.  We are in the middle of a very deep recession and people cannot obtain finance from banks or credit unions, social welfare payments have been cut drastically and the Government has abolished payments such as communion and confirmation grants.  Many vulnerable and poor families who do not have resources fall into the arms of moneylenders when it comes to communion and confirmation.  The Bill would provide protection for someone who made a complaint to the Garda.  At the very least even if there was not enough evidence to convict someone a judge could put in place a barring order to prevent an individual or his or her agents from threatening or making contact with the person who owes him or her money.  The Bill is part of the solution and the Government should accept it on Second Stage and allow amendment should it be required.<\/p><p>We intend to bring forward further legislation on legal moneylenders.  We do not have a maximum APR set by the Central Bank.  One company in particular, which I will not mention, offers a &euro;500 loan repayable over 52 weeks at a payment rate of &euro;15 a week.  Somebody who may not be too financially competent might think this is reasonable, but it is an APR of approximately 160%.  People prey on the vulnerable and desperate and those who are not up to speed on finance.<\/p> <p> At least those moneylenders are legal, but illegal moneylending generally emanates from organised crime, dissident groups and drug dealers, people who are dangerous in their own right.  Senator MacSharry's Bill would provide protection and increase the maximum penalty to 14 years in prison.  Under it, a judge could instruct an individual or his or her agents not to make further contact with a person.  This is a sensible approach and I am interested in the Minister's response.<\/p><p>I would be also interested to know whether his Department or the Department of Finance plans to tackle moneylending in general.  A part of the legislation that we intend to introduce will deal with the advertising of legal moneylenders.  They run promotions such as no credit checks, guaranteed loans, borrow up to &euro;500 instantly, etc.  These adverts are prevalent on British television and are creeping into this country at an alarming rate.  Were this Bill accepted, it would form part of the solution and lay down a marker that the Government was willing to do something about the issue.<\/p><p>This is not an easy matter and one size does not fit all.  People's social welfare payments have been cut and they cannot access finance through normal channels because their banks will not lend to them if their credit cards are maxed out.  Generally, it is family events such as communions, confirmations and weddings that prompt them to try to get their hands on &euro;500.  They do not realise how much they will repay.  More importantly, they do not have the protection of the courts.  As Senator MacSharry stated, there have been no convictions under the current legislation.  This Bill would make it easier for the courts to set down a barring order.  It might be a start to the process.  I hope the Minister sees fit to allow the Bill to pass Second Stage and to accept it in the manner in which it has been proposed.  It is constructive, well thought out legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200036#MM00200","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369234800,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I would like, at the outset, to express my appreciation to Senator MacSharry for publishing the Criminal Justice (Unlicensed Money-Lending) Bill 2013.  The Senator has, through this Bill, put on the agenda once more the important issue of illegal moneylending.<\/p><p>Responsibility for legislation on the regulation of moneylending and the prohibition of illegal moneylending lies with the Ministers for Finance and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, respectively.  Comprehensive legislation targeting the illegal lending of money has been on the Statute Book for some time and has, indeed, been strengthened in recent years.  Licensed moneylenders operate under the regulatory control of the Financial Regulator, who can impose &quot;administrative sanctions&quot; against moneylenders licensed by him for prescribed contraventions of legislation or regulatory rules.<\/p><p>The focus of today's debate is illegal moneylending, which is addressed by section 98 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  This prohibits any person from engaging in the business of moneylending without a licence.  Acting as an agent of an unlicensed moneylender is also prohibited.<\/p><p>A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has considerable powers under the Act where he or she has reasonable cause to suspect that a person is engaging in the business of unlicensed moneylending.  The member may, without warrant, stop, question, search - if need be by force - and remove from that person any document or money which the member reasonably believes may be in that person's possession for the purpose of moneylending.  It is an offence to obstruct or interfere with a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na using those powers.  It is also an offence to give a garda information which is false or misleading or to fail to comply with any request made by a garda using those powers.<\/p><p>The primary offence of engaging in unlicensed moneylending is indictable and it is noteworthy that legislation brought forward by the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, namely, the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005, increased the penalties for the offence to a fine not exceeding &euro;100,000, imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.  In addition, the offence of demanding money with menaces under section 17 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 already carries a penalty of up to 14 years imprisonment.<\/p><p>As the Minister for Justice and Equality, I share the Senator's concern for persons who fall victim to those unscrupulous individuals who would prey on their fellow citizens through illegal moneylending.  I think the House will agree, however, that the powers granted to the Garda to address the problem, and, indeed, the penalties available to the Judiciary in this regard, are considerable.  In that regard, the provisions of this Bill would not in fact create any new power or penalty.  The Bill effectively replicates offences which are already on the Statute Book.<\/p><p>The provision in section 2 of the Bill, which proposes making an offence of &quot;extortion, demanding money with menaces and unlicensed money-lending&quot;, replicates and merges the separate offences already contained in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, section 17, provides for the offence of blackmail, extortion and demanding money with menaces.  This section already provides that it is an offence for any person who, with a view to gain for himself, herself or others or with intent to cause loss to another, makes any unwarranted demand with menaces.  The Consumer Credit Act 1995, section 98, provides for the prohibition on engaging in business of moneylending without a licence, as previously mentioned.  This section already provides that a person shall not engage in the business of moneylending on his or her own behalf unless the person is the holder of a moneylender's licence and maintains a business premises for that purpose.<\/p><p>However, whereas the existing legislation provides clarity in dealing separately with these two very separate and distinct offences, the proposed Bill would, in my view, create confusion by effectively merging these two separate offences.  Furthermore, the penalties proposed in the Bill are equivalent to the existing penalties already imposed for the relevant offence under the 1994 Act.  This already carries a penalty of up to 14 years on indictment, the penalty that Senator MacSharry made reference to in his Bill.<\/p><p>In addition, the law already provides in the Criminal Justice Act 2007, section 26, that a court may make a monitoring and protection order to protect a victim of an offence from harassment by the offender.  This provision can be made by a court in regard to the offence of demanding money with menaces, as defined by section 17 of the 1994 Act.  A court may also make an order protecting a person from harassment under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, even where the court finds that the alleged offender is not guilty of an offence.  This is identical to the provision in section 2(5) of the Bill.<\/p><p>For these reasons, the Bill would not provide our courts and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with any power they do not already have under existing legislation.  The Bill would therefore have no legal effect other than to make the law less effective and more obscure by blurring the distinction between the separate offences of illegal moneylending and demanding money with menaces.  This would, in my view, not be appropriate.<\/p><p>I think we are all aware as public representatives of the damage that illegal moneylenders can cause in people's lives.  Typically, they prey on the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people in our communities and charge extortionate interest rates for money lent.  Rates in excess of 100% are by no means unusual.  Prosecuting people for the offence is very difficult - that I acknowledge - because the loans are informal and undocumented and the vulnerable victims often live in terror of the moneylender, so they are typically extremely reluctant to make formal complaint about the offender.  I have been advised by the Garda authorities that, where offences under section 98 are disclosed and are reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the matter will be the subject of investigation under the direction of the local district officer, with relevant expert assistance available from the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  I would encourage those who have information concerning the operation of unlicensed moneylenders to make that information available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which will take all measures open to it to enforce the law in this area.<\/p><p>However, we must remain aware of the considerable reluctance of victims to provide evidence against offenders to whom they owe money.  Prosecutions for illegal moneylending are very infrequent.  There is one case pertaining to illegal moneylending activities - offences under the Consumer Credit Act 1995 - currently before the courts.<\/p><p>Due to the infrequency of prosecutions, I believe that, in tackling the problem, legislation and enforcement can go only so far.<\/p> <p>In addressing the issue, the greatest success comes when the support and assistance of the community is brought to bear to ensure persons in vulnerable positions are well advised about steering clear of illegal moneylending.  That is why I believe that community-based initiatives such as the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, popularly known as MABS, are crucial in ensuring that people who are under financial pressure can be advised to take the appropriate steps to avoid falling into the moneylender's trap.  MABS also advises people on how to reach accommodations with credit institutions and how to avail of the exceptional needs assistance available from community welfare officers.  In concert with MABS, other services such as credit unions, community development projects, family support centres, social services and Government-funded voluntary organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul play an important role in providing appropriate advice and guidance to vulnerable people.  Additionally, and shortly to come into force, there will be the help available under the Personal Insolvency Act of 2012 to facilitate those in substantial financial difficulty to enter into appropriate settlements.  That is a far preferable route to dealing with creditors than borrowing money from illegal moneylenders.<\/p><p>As he mentioned it, Senator MacSharry will be aware of the efforts of the Communities Against Illegal Lending of Money, CAILM, initiative in his own constituency.  This is an inter-agency approach funded by the Government, involving the local community, the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, the credit union movement, Focus Ireland, the local Garda and social services in diverting people away from illegal moneylending.  I commend the work that organisation does and join the praise voiced by Senator MacSharry in his contribution.<\/p><p>We all share the concern for persons who fall victim to those unscrupulous individuals who prey on their fellow citizens through illegal moneylending.  I believe the House will agree, however, that the powers granted to the Garda to address the problem and the penalties available to the Judiciary in this area are considerable.  Unfortunately, this Bill would not provide our courts or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with any powers they do not already have under existing legislation.  The Bill would have no legal effect, therefore, other than to make the law less effective and more obscure by blurring the distinction between two separate offences, namely, illegal moneylending and demanding money with menaces, which would be an undesirable outcome.  However, I appreciate and share the genuine concern Senator MacSharry voiced about the extent to which moneylenders exploit the most vulnerable and I welcome the opportunity to address this very important issue in this House.  I urge people not to fall prey to illegal moneylenders and, if they find themselves in financial difficulties, to use the other mechanisms available to them to which I referred.  Each of us should encourage organisations in our individual constituencies to publicise that message.  In most constituencies throughout the country there are voluntary groups and individuals, branches of MABS and others who are engaged in this very important work.<\/p><p>I point out to Senator MacSharry that it is not my inclination, having been on the receiving end for too many years, automatically to vote down a Private Members' Bill.  Rather I am anxious to encourage people to work on such Bills because often there are areas of importance that, in Government, one has difficulty in prioritising, given other demands.  I can tell the House I have no difficulty with this, as a Minister.  If a Bill is produced in an area that truly requires legislation and if the Government has not had an opportunity to address it, I will not, as Minister, automatically say we should oppose that legislation.  That is the wrong approach.  I believe we should encourage people, whether in this or the other House, to act as legislators and make a contribution.  For the reasons given, however, I must oppose the particular provisions of the Bill before us, but I welcome that the House has an opportunity to discuss this important issue which can have such a detrimental impact on the lives of very many vulnerable people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200037#NN00200","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369235400,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I commend Senator MacSharry on bringing this matter before the House, and I note with satisfaction the presence of the Minister because it is good to have a senior Cabinet Minister with us in Seanad &Eacute;ireann for this kind of debate.  I also welcome the Minister's attitude towards the entire issue of moneylending, one he made clear during the passage of the insolvency legislation, when I and others raised this question.  It surely must be a concern, however, that there is in some areas, especially in our cities, what amounts to a crisis in terms of moneylending, in particular illegal moneylending.  That this is not being satisfactorily addressed at present must be clear from the fact that there has not been a single instance since 2005 of an illegal moneylender facing serious charges, being jailed or fined substantially.  The practice is widespread and we know from listening to people on the wireless they have immense difficulty from the pressure caused.  I recall listening during the past six months to a woman who was put under such pressure.<\/p><p>I note the occupant of the ministerial chair has changed.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, and ask him to pass on to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, the recommendations I shall make, particularly given that the Minister who has just left indicated his strong support for the views of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Coincidentally, today I received a magazine from that society which makes clear recommendations.  It concurs with my view that there is a crisis.  As my time is limited, I wish to put those remarks immediately on the record of the House.<\/p><p>To reiterate, the St. Vincent de Paul Society indicates that a crisis exists.  The contradiction, which is clear to anybody, is that it is the most vulnerable people who are engaging in the practice of the most dangerous form of borrowing money.  Very often they cannot repay it properly.  Recommendation No. 1 of the St. Vincent de Paul Society is that the Central Bank be asked to publish baseline data on the number of loans and the number of households with such loans in the Republic of Ireland.  The second recommendation is that the total cost of credit should be emphasised in loan agreements.  In my view, we should also include the APR figure.  In his speech the Minister noted there were some unscrupulous people who charged more than 100%.  They are not only the unscrupulous or the unlicensed, however.  Licensed moneylenders, including the largest one, Provident Financial, which has 75,000 loans extended in this country, charges up to 187% per annum, yet this is not regarded as an offence although we complain about 20% or 17.5% being charged on credit cards.  This is a very serious situation.<\/p><p>It is recommended that moneylending companies should not be permitted to offer loans that are more four times the proven weekly income.  That would protect people who cannot afford to make the repayments.  Often these are not huge amounts - perhaps &euro;500 to cover a child's first Communion - and it seems all right that people should pay &euro;50 a week.  However, they may not be able to afford this sum.  It looks all right at the time of the crisis or emergency that is often associated with a family event.  The society also seeks greater regulation regarding the amount which can be borrowed and how often a loan can be obtained.  It suggests a minimum time delay between one loan and another and that there be only one loan per adult in a household.  These are all obvious suggestions and should be kept before the mind of the Minister.<\/p><p>Moneylending companies should be made responsible for the lending and payment collection activities of their agents.  We have had the example of a gentleman known as &quot;The Viper&quot;, who started a debt collection agency having had a long career as a violent criminal.  People are absolutely terrified of him.  All he has to do is put a sign on his van - &quot;The Viper Collects&quot;, or whatever it may be - drive in front of a person's house and I can guarantee that person will pay up pretty quickly.<\/p><p>There is a recommendation that the Central Bank should produce information brochures and offer financial education.  FLAC has done a very good job here, with an excellent brochure, &quot;Moneylending and the Law&quot;.  MABS also does this work.<\/p> <p>There is a crisis.  It has not been addressed satisfactorily, which is clearly evident from the widescale extortionate interest rates being charged with no one being convicted of these offences.<br \/><b><\/b>Perhaps the Minister's speech is a little out of date.  My colleague and friend, Senator Barrett, suggested that I should table an amendment to the Minister's speech because the copy I have states clearly at the top: &quot;Speech by Minister for Justice, Second Stage Seanad &Eacute;ireann, 22 May 2011&quot;.  That is I think two years ago, so it may be slightly out of date, it could, of course, also be a printing error.<\/p><p> A report on the licensed moneylending industry in March 2007 by the Financial Regulator states:<blockquote>In 2005, licensed moneylenders had approximately 300,000 customers.  This represents approximately 10% of the population of the Republic of Ireland in 2005 over the age of 20 years.<\/blockquote>I was surprised at the number of people involved, but I was even more surprised to discover that 89% of the customers were satisfied.  That cannot represent naivety, particularly when one considers that 50% of them gave them ten out of ten.  It is obvious to me that actually the problems arise in the area of unlicensed and unregulated loan sharks.<\/p><p> When I noticed the Minister was leaving I had to frontload some of my remarks.  I heard a woman on the radio speaking about taking her life because she had borrowed in order to help her son with a deposit.  She had sold all her furniture.  She had no food in the house.  She was sleeping on the floor because she was paying enormous sums in interest.  To my mind that is not tolerable.  For that reason I am glad that Senator MacSharry introduced this legislation.  The Minister is slightly contradictory and states the Bill replicates offences that are already on the Statute Book, namely, blackmail, extortion, demanding money with menaces and so on.  He further states that it will have the contradictory effect.  I am left to wonder if these provisions also have a contradictory effect.<\/p><p> I congratulate Senator MacSharry.  He has raised an important matter.  I am not satisfied that it is being effectively dealt with.  We owe the most vulnerable in our society the protection of the law.  It appears that legal moneylenders, in spite of their enormous rates of interest, are providing a service that people are capable of dealing with but the illegal moneylenders are bleeding vulnerable people to death in some instances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200038#OO00200","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369236000,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I listened with interest to the debate.  I have regard for the contributions that Senators MacSharry and O'Brien have made during my two years in the Seanad.  The theme of the legislation is extremely important and as Senator Norris quite rightly said, it deals with the most vulnerable people in society.<\/p><p>Many people have very little time for banks and I would probably include myself in that category, but I have no tolerance at all of moneylenders.  The place of moneylenders in society is close to the bottom of the barrel.  I am glad this matter is on the Seanad agenda, as it gives a forum for discussion of a topic that comes in under the radar in comparison to dealing with the euro billions in bailouts and the 150,000 mortgages in arrears.  People may owe as little as &euro;400 to &euro;500 to appalling individuals who have no sense of social justice, decency and responsibility.  These people, who may live in local authority housing, matter.  They may not have mortgages of &euro;100,000 plus in arrears.  These people are managing just about to pay their rent but are being scalded and hounded by these merciless individuals.  The reality is that people who use moneylenders possibly do not have the skillset to know their legal rights, to know what protections are in place and that is the reason it has become apparent to certain groups.  Senator O'Keeffe has been telling me about the group in Sligo which is doing phenomenal work on behalf of people.  They may feel that the current legislation is not being properly implemented.  That is the major challenge.<\/p><p>I take on board the comment by the Minister that were this Bill to become law, those engaging with it would be dealing with replication.  We do not want to create that situation, but in fairness I do not think that was the intent.  I think the Opposition has made a very genuine effort to raise an extremely important issue and the Minister's words were very conciliatory in that regard, when he said that he does not knock down Bills in Private Members' time easily, as he did not like this being done to him when he was in opposition.<\/p><p>The Minister expressed the fear of duplication, with more cogs in the wheel that were unnecessary, making the bike unsafe.  The major problem is that if this Bill were enacted, it would create a situation in which the most vulnerable people could become more confused about their rights than they are at present.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, who is a very loyal contributor to this House.  It was remiss of me not to have done so earlier.  The challenge for the Government is to focus and become challenged to ensure that the most vulnerable people know their rights when it comes to moneylenders.  There are some very useful ways of channelling that type of information.  Citizens Information and MABS have already been mentioned but there are other ways.  One could send out explanatory literature twice yearly with social welfare payments, explaining in simple language what people's rights are when dealing with moneylenders.  It is only a tiny minority of people who find themselves in these difficult situations who have the wherewithal to go to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make a formal complaint and request the assistance of the State mechanisms to assist them.  I can remember a case about four years ago, in which a client of mine found herself in an appalling situation with an illegal moneylender and her PPS card was being requested.  I told her that she and I would both meet the individual and that would deal with the situation.  We did.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na got involved and dealt with the situation very quickly.  The matter was resolved.<\/p><p>We need the Government to sit down with organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, MABS and a number of other agencies and perhaps set up an interdepartmental working group or a working group with representation from those various different groups to identify ways of communicating to the people who are the most vulnerable what their rights are, what they can expect in terms of protection from the State and how to deal with moneylenders.  We have already heard from the Minister that one cannot be a moneylender in this country unless one has a licence.  If a moneylender has no licence he or she is in breach of the law and is acting illegally.  Second, the business model and client base of licensed moneylenders must be continuously audited to ensure they are acting with the utmost integrity in dealing with their clients.<\/p><p>I commend Senator MacSharry for raising this issue.  The group in Sligo dealing with this issue is doing very good work and I commend his colleague on the council for the work she has done.<\/p> <p>I would like to see what is happening in Sligo reflected in other counties, so that these groups mushroom throughout the country to equip the people with knowledge.  It has been a very worthwhile debate and I sincerely hope we see some action as a result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200039#PP00200","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369236600,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and look forward to seeing him in our home county tomorrow.  We will give him a very warm welcome, as usual.  I compliment my colleague, Senator MacSharry, on bringing forward this legislation, and the theory behind it is to be commended.  Nevertheless, it raises some fundamental questions.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide new offences and prohibit unlicensed moneylenders from subjecting victims to harassment.  While this may work fine in theory, there is also a responsibility on the Government to try to ensure that if the law is passed, there is additional support for the people at whom it is directed.  Those involved with moneylending are usually in the very lowest strata of society and at their most vulnerable.  They have gone through all the conventional methods of seeking finance for whatever purposes they need, and it is usually family reasons like communion, confirmation or a few days respite.  It could be for a variety of legitimate reasons, even putting food on the table.<\/p><p>I must be careful in choosing words but with the plethora of Government and other agencies out there, there should not be any room for moneylenders.  There is the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, various other worthwhile charities, the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, which helps people, especially those with limited resources manage their money, and there is the social welfare system.  There really should not be any need for moneylenders, but the fact that there is means there is something wrong or malfunctioning within the system that drives people to extreme lengths, putting them in a most vulnerable position where a Bill of this nature must be passed to address issues of intimidation and harassment.<\/p><p>My only difficulty with the practicality of the Bill is that because of the circumstances of people who are involved with moneylenders, they will not only be the most vulnerable but will be so intimidated that garda&iacute; will not be able to pursue prosecutions.  To pursue a prosecution one must have witnesses and statements and go through the courts, all of which is included in this Bill.  That will not happen.  People will be fearful and we have heard some of the horrific stories circulating about the intimidation by moneylenders or associates.  This has led Senator MacSharry to bring forward this legislation.  One particular criminal who goes under one of the funny names applied to give a human face, such as the Penguin, went around with his name written on a van.  He said he set himself up as a legitimate moneylender.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200040#QQ00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1369236600,"counter":446,"content":"<p>It is the Viper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200040#QQ00300","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1369236600,"counter":447,"content":"<p>He indicated he had set up a legitimate moneylending service but if a person fell foul of him, he did not have to violently attack anybody.

He would turn up in his van outside a person's house, with \"Viper\" written across the van in big and bold lettering, and he or his associates would just sit there.  How does a Bill like this address such intimidation or harassment?  I would venture to suggest that the person to whom this implied threat of violence is being directed would be so scared that the last thing he or she would do is go to the local garda&iacute;.  That is why I suggest that on top of this Bill, there should be some sort of mechanism that the State should be able to address.  I do not know how this could be done as we are talking about human nature but it is the only flaw I see in the practicalities and effectiveness of the Bill.<\/p><p>It seems we should consider the issue in the same way as prostitution and go after a different source.  Perhaps more resources should be given to the Garda?  When people like the Viper are questioned, they say they are running a legitimate business.  He should not be allowed to run a legitimate business because he is a convicted thug and criminal.  Perhaps we should examine how people applying for trading licences or other aspects of business get approval.  They may comply in theory with 90% of the law in order for them to be able to stay outside the law 10% of the time, which in this case is critical.  Perhaps in this way we could facilitate the State to go after these people, helped by legislation like this, so that when they are caught, they will be put away for a long time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200040#QQ00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1369236600,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I join other Senators in acknowledging Senator MacSharry's concern and his efforts in this regard.  Nobody in the House would have a difficulty in the broad area of moneylending, especially illegal moneylending.  People have outlined very clearly that it is a criminal activity that causes grief, not just with financial worry for families but also on a much wider scale when it comes to the kind of intimidation and harassment used on a regular basis.<\/p><p>It was not Senator MacSharry's intention in the Bill to make the law more confusing, as has been suggested, by merging the two very separate and distinct offences of unlicensed moneylending and demanding money with menaces.  I share many of his concerns - we are both based in Sligo - but neither of us wants to add to anything that would make the law more confusing.  Raising the matter and related issues is important, and it is clear that for the Government, the challenge remains what can we do to tackle this very difficult problem.  There are many and varied approaches to take so I will mention some possible action that could be separate to legislation.  The difficulty with bringing people before the courts has been explained, because people are intimidated and afraid and do not know what to do.  The last thing people will do is point out a particular person and be willing to give evidence in court.  I am aware there are two cases pending in Sligo that are with the Director of Public Prosecutions, and I hope they will come to court and help set an example.<\/p><p>I give credit to the work of the Communities Against Illegal Lending of Money, CAILM, group in Sligo, set up as a subgroup of the RAPID community safety task force.  It includes the RAPID co-ordinator, community garda&iacute;, the credit union, MABS, the Sligo Education Centre, social services, the Springboard resource house project, the Cranmore community co-op, Northside CDP, other community representatives, the Cranmore regeneration project, Sligo Borough Council and elected members.  It is often difficult to appreciate the level of co-operation required, but it is a very good model and perhaps one we might see in other parts of Ireland.  People who are genuinely concerned have come together to share expertise and knowledge, and although their achievements so far may be terribly simple, they have also been terribly effective.<\/p><p>The first achievement is related to raising awareness and getting the message out there.  The group speaks to people in the community, particularly in Cranmore, where there has been a specific problem, but also in other areas of Sligo.  CAILM has produced a brochure, entitled Lenny Disease in Your Community, which indicates that so-called &quot;lennies&quot; are nasty and poisonous pests that can be found anywhere in any community.  They are quite cunning but are generally quite dumb.  Of course, a &quot;lenny&quot; is an illegal moneylender.  These leaflets have been spread as part of an awareness-raising campaign that includes press releases and radio pieces.<\/p> <p>They have presented to the joint policing committee in Sligo and, of course, they have lobbied Members of the Oireachtas.  That is part of their job.  We sometimes underestimate the need for awareness raising.  Many people do not know there are other avenues available.<\/p><p>The other step, after awareness raising, is to do something about it.  The initiative of developing a community bank in Crannmore estate has been very welcome.  It is operated by Sligo Credit Union and the Resource House project.  It is a small bank specifically for that area and it is slowly beginning to encourage a savings habit in people who were never able to have a bank account, never understood what a bank account was, never wanted a bank account and, perhaps, had used illegal money lenders on previous occasions because that is all they had available to them. They have actively promoted the services of credit unions, MABS and social services.  They have done this through the schools, in summer school holidays and have gone in and talked very effectively to parents trying to encourage them to see different ways they can recycle and reuse things that perhaps they did not think of before.  It is a very slow, but effective, process.  Finally, CAM has been working very closely with the Garda to try to help people to come forward and say, until we start prosecuting people and we see them in court we will not understand that this is a crime and we will not be able to send a message.<\/p><p>I was very lucky many years ago when I worked at the BBC to go to Birmingham where they had a very good pilot project.  It was only in the early days then.  I remember them saying it to me at the time, when I worked as a senior producer, that they very much hoped it would be a project they would roll out across the UK.  Indeed, they have done that.  They have used a lot of money.  They have seconded police officers who specialise in gathering intelligence on money lending.  They have had 180 prosecutions since they have been set up.  They have very specific support for victims.  They work very closely with the trading standards team.  They have financial inclusion partnership officers who do nothing else but specifically support communities and raise awareness.  They do what Communities Against Illegal Lending of Money, CAILM, is doing but on a much grander and better-financed scale.  They are using social media, talking to credit unions and local banks and effectively taking the fight to the loan sharks and saying that until they do that, nothing will change.  One of the people they prosecuted and imprisoned had charged the highest APR ever recorded, 117,000%.<\/p><p>There is a lot of work to be done.  The challenge is with Government.  It may not be through this piece of legislation, but it certainly means there is a support process.  I advocate that the work done by CAILM, funded by this Government, would be used as a model to be rolled out and supported in a much wider context so that we would be seen to be active on the ground to defeat what is an extremely serious and growing problem, particularly for families who can least afford it and who are least able to cope with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200040#QQ00500","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369237200,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I thank Senator MacSharry for raising these issues, and indeed Members on all sides of the House.  This is an important debate where the Seanad reaches out to help those in serious need because of what has happened to finance and banking in this country.  In contrast, half of the bank rescue fund was paid to Anglo Irish Bank, which was a bank for approximately 18 people.  Tens of millions, billions of euro were paid out in that case and the system was so dysfunctional that it left many people victim to the money lenders, as Senator MacSharry and the Minister said.<\/p><p>  It must be a concern that the Minister said there has been only one prosecution for illegal money lending.  It is a far greater problem than that suggests.  We have lost out of the system and weakened institutions which would be of value to the people whom Senator MacSharry is helping with his legislation.  I commend the Credit Union Movement and the great work of people such as John Hume in promoting those, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Deputy Shatter with the Personal Insolvency Act.  We have to act against intimidation.  Senator Michael D'Arcy was most concerned in Wexford at the heavies, quasi criminal groups, who call around to collect tractors and so on, in a period when some of his farming neighbours were in difficulties.<\/p><p>  We need to look at the institutions we have lost such as thrift associations and savings clubs.  The Trustee Savings Banks were banks for low income people to try to put money by.  If one can do it, learning how to work with credit is a major advantage in trying to run households and develop the wider economy.  Banks used to do things like promote thrift and savings in schools, but they became obsessed with lending to the 18 people in banks such as Anglo Irish Bank.  Building societies used to be mutual benefit societies, part of the wider co-operative movement where people got together to buy each other's houses.  One of the building societies that now has a financial sector name was originally the Dublin Working Men's Mutual Benefit Building Society.  People got together to help each other to manage their financial affairs.<\/p><p>  I commend the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  We need banks with a human face and we have not had those.  They have been so busy running around with the people who bankrupted the country.  The low interest rate policy that is so widely believed in by so many international economists deprives low-income people with small savings of some income so that we can promote property bubbles and fund massive borrowing by really rich people.  That is a form of inequality in society that we have to address.<\/p><p>  I had not heard of the 117,000% interest rate that Senator O'Keeffe has just drawn attention to.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i> of 7 March 2013 reports a 300% interest rate on loans.  Sinn F&eacute;in last year sought to introduce a cap of 40%.  Legislation in Canadian limits interest to 60%, Spain 10%, France and Belgium 20% and Germany 18% to 20%.  We need to address the inequality in the access to funds for renegade builders and ordinary citizens, particularly at the low end of the scale.  In the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i> of 26 June 2012 Mr. Brendan Dempsey of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is quoted as saying &quot;nobody will give evidence&quot; in cases against money lenders.  The Minister has acknowledged that.  Are we naive to think people would even go to the Garda?  It may be that these people are so isolated, fearful and separated from the rest of society that even garda&iacute; would be regarded as establishment figures.<\/p><p>  We must deal with loan sharking and money lending.  We must promote the democratisation of society's saving so that low-income people can participate in what is part of a developed economy, the ability to borrow money, use it wisely and pay it back.<\/p><p>  I wonder if the fine of &euro;1,500 is a bit small compared to the illegalities and the criminality that Senator MacSharry is attempting to combat with his Bill.  I commend it warmly, and all Members of the House must, because this is a real problem for people who are socially deprived and it has to be tackled.  Sometimes we are all more interested in removing income limits or universalising a benefit, which is really extending something from very low-income people to the rest of society, who may be well-off.  However this is a measure designed to deal with low-income people who require better institutional assistance and the restoration of some of the bodies that used to help them in this regard.<\/p><p>  I commend the Government for rescuing the Credit Union Movement from the difficulties we saw it in because we need to get credit and help to people with their financial affairs.  Mr. Micawber was mocked in the glory era.  Who wanted to balance the books like that?  Governments and countries do not do it but households have to do it and we should assist in any way we can.  I commend Senator MacSharry again.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I commend Senator MacSharry and his colleagues for bringing this important issue to the fore through the Criminal Justice (Unlicensed Money-Lending) Bill 2013.  Other colleagues have spoken eloquently about the real trauma, fear and intimidation that takes place in the unlicensed or illegal moneylending sector where people are forced to pay enormous rates of interest, as illustrated by Senator Susan O'Keeffe.  All of us would unequivocally condemn those practices and have full sympathy for the motivation behind the legislation.  All of us are agreed on the need to ensure the issue is dealt with rigorously through the law.<\/p><p>In his contribution, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, was very clear that a consequence of accepting the Bill would be to create a duplication and a dangerous blurring of offences.  We all appreciate the motivation but the provision in section 2 to condense two different offences that are currently on the Statute Book, of demanding money with menaces on the one hand, blackmail extortion, and that brand of offence with this very separate offence of unlicensed moneylending is a dangerous blurring.  The Minister has pointed out that section 98 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 deals with the unlicensed moneylending aspect of that particular offence and gives the Garda very extensive powers to stop, question or search and remove documents or money from people without warrants where it reasonably believes that such documents or money may be in that person's possession for the purpose of moneylending.  Extensive powers are already in place.  The penalty was increased in 2005 for that offence up to five years imprisonment or a fine of &euro;100,000, which is entirely appropriate.  <\/p><p>Section 17 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 deals with the separate offence of blackmail, extortion and demanding money with menaces.  It provides for a heavier penalty, which is correct, because that is a more serious offence and an offence of a different nature, of imprisonment for 14 years on indictment.  Under the Criminal Justice Act 2007 we have the ability to provide for monitoring and protection orders where people are subjected to harassment on an ongoing basis by moneylenders.  There is a strong argument, given the nature of the debate, for codifying the offences.  An issue I have often addressed in the House with the Minister, Deputy Shatter is the lack of codification and the unsatisfactory nature of our criminal law.  In order words, we have to look to different statutes.  On the face of it the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Order does not appear to have anything to do with blackmail.  It deals specifically with public order offences, such as, drunk and disorderly in a public place and so on, therefore, it is arguably not the appropriate place to find an offence of blackmail or extortion.  Similarly we might ask why there is a separate Act for dealing with monitoring and protection orders and why criminal law is not codified in a much more coherent manner.  That is a much bigger issue.  It is certainly an issue that Senator Jillian van Turnhout and I have addressed in the context of child sexual abuse offences where one has to look to a whole range of statutes to find what the law is on offences of sexual abuse against children.  There is a bigger issue here about placing offences in an appropriate and accessible place.  I know that is what the Senators are seeking to do in this Bill but, as I have said, it would duplicate existing law. <\/p><p>A further valid point was made by the Minister, which was picked up by Senator Sean D. Barrett and others, which is the difficulty in securing convictions.  That has nothing to do with the offences on the Statute Book because one could have any number of offences.  The difficulty has been getting people to come forward.  First, there is a lack of complaints to the Garda which could trigger investigations and prosecutions and, second, even where an offence is suspected and the Garda has commenced investigation and taken a prosecution there is a lack of willing witnesses who will come forward and give evidence and testify and swear up, so to speak, in criminal cases dealing with illegal moneylending.  The reality is that people who are in vulnerable positions and who have been subjected to the type of practices the Bill seeks to deal with are often not willing to come forward to give evidence for obvious reasons.  The Minister is right to say that the real challenge for policymakers and legislators is to ensure people have viable alternatives available to them in order that they do not have to avail of these unscrupulous lenders.  The Minister referred to MABS.  Senators mentioned other efforts such as the CAILM initiative in Sligo.  Clearly these are the best way to ensure people do not fall into the hands of moneylenders.<\/p><p>I appreciate the Minister's comments that he considered accepting the Bill and that he was not going to oppose it for the sake of it because it is a Private Members' Bill.  We have had a good record in the past year or so of having Private Members' Bills accepted.  It is important that we would not, as a matter of course, oppose Private Members' Bills.  Whether they come from Government, Independent or Opposition Senators it is important that each Bill is scrutinised on its own merit and, in fairness, this one was so scrutinised and a clear rationale put forward for opposing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200041#RR00200","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369237800,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I support the Bill which has been introduced by my colleague, Senator Marc MacSharry, and compliment him for the work and effort he has put into it.  It is a very difficult area and a serious problem.  I was disappointed that the Minister dismissed out of hand the efforts of Senator MacSharry.  The current legislation, irrespective of what category, is failing those people who are caught in the trap of receiving money from these moneylenders.  Unfortunately, in a time of recession the loan sharks, the unlicensed moneylenders, come to the surface.  They emerge like rats from a sewer in difficult times and are difficult to deal with.  The people who are in dire straits and go to moneylenders probably have a poor record with banks, no account with credit unions, may have burned their bridge with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and exhausted all opportunities and as a last resort are prepared to throw the last dice in an effort to get &euro;100, &euro;200 or &euro;500 to survive.  That is a most unfortunate situation.<\/p><p>  I listened carefully to what the Minister had to say.  He said there was sufficient law in this area and that this Bill would be duplication.  If that is the case why is the scourge of moneylending raising its ugly head so frequently throughout Ireland at present?  That is likely to continue while the recession continues.  I would hate to see poor people who are borrowing money at exorbitant interest rates, sometimes 300% which is extraordinary, further crucified.  One has to ask from where those who are providing the money are getting it.  Is it money that has been laundered?  Is it money derived from the sale of drugs or other illegal or illicit activities and, if so, the current laws are not adequate to turn the screws on them, because it is obviously continuing.<\/p><p>  Like other speakers, I laud the great work done by our credit unions throughout the country, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and so on who have done immense work.  The moneylender is a bit like a drug addict, he needs a supply and has to survive.  He will not go to the Garda and will not squeal on the supplier of drugs and is in a desperate situation for a fix.  Those who are borrowing the money, sometimes to feed their children or keep the roof over their heads, will do anything in desperate situations to get a few bob and will be very slow to bite the hand that feeds them on that particular occasion.  The <i>modus operandi <\/i>of some of the loan sharks is threats, intimidation and instilling fear into unfortunate victims.  In many instances, having borrowed a relatively small amount of money at the start, the loan sharks are so astute that before one repays the last few bob one is encouraged into another roll-over scenario. <\/p> <p>It is a desperate situation and one problem leads to another.<\/p><p>Moneylending is a serious issue and Senator MacSharry must be given great credit for highlighting the issue.  At the height of the boom moneylending was a miniscule problem.  The Irish and European wide recession has changed its status and moneylenders, who are primarily illegal, are coming out of the woodwork again.  Moneylenders can see that people are in desperate situations and dangle a carrot in front of them, entice and trap people.  The Senator's Bill has highlighted a real problem that is evident in our towns, cities and throughout the country.  The law does not protect the victims of moneylending and that is why he has raised the issue.  <\/p><p>I shall conclude by asking the Minister of State to convey a message to the Minister for Justice and Equality that moneylending is a serious ongoing problem that will not go away.  The current legislation does not protect victims.  That is the truth.  We cannot sidestep this unsatisfactory and difficult issue.  Senator MacSharry must be commended for bringing the matter to the attention of the House.  I understand that the Minister does not wish to accept the Bill.  If he does not accept the legislation then we will not see the end of the problem this year or next year and the citizens and country must face an ongoing, serious and unfortunate problem. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200042#SS00200","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369238400,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I was not scheduled to speak tonight.  When I saw that the Bill was scheduled to be debated I decided to add my voice here because it is such an important issue.  I may not always agree with Senator MacSharry but I give him great credit for bringing the matter into the political arena.<\/p><p>Moneylending exists, whether we like it or not.  I spoke during the debate on domestic violence which is a taboo subject.  Moneylending is also a taboo subject.  People will not admit that they borrow from moneylenders.  People approach public representatives when they want help but, normally, they will not admit to borrowing from moneylenders.  Illegal moneylenders prey on the underprivileged, the unemployed and the socially deprived.  They are the people who can least afford to meet exorbitant repayments.<\/p><p>I lived in a local authority estate once.  I remember a company, and I shall not name names, arriving in the estate and started off by offering a hire purchase option to enable people to buy little items of clothing for their children or household goods. The company then offered money to people to pay the costs of a first communion or confirmation ceremony even when people did not seek it out.  On many occasions the woman of the house, either the wife or partner, borrowed the money but never told their husbands or partners.  The women were put under fierce financial pressure to pay the loan back without the knowledge of their husbands or partners.  Of course a borrower was never allowed to clear the loan.  As Senator O'Donovan said, one would be about to pay it all off when one would have to borrow for something else or robbed Peter to pay Paul.  A person would end up owing money all of the time.<\/p><p>One does not have to approach legal moneylenders for loans.  We have all seen television advertisements for credit cards but the small print states that the interest charged can range between a whopping 34% and 38%.  However, people do not take much notice of the small print and apply for a card anyway.  One pays a lot for the privilege to use the cards.<\/p><p>I congratulate Senator MacSharry for heightening awareness of moneylending.  It does no harm to talk about the problem.  People have been harassed, bullied and threatened by illegal moneylenders.  They will not come forward to lodge a complaint because they are physically afraid and fear for their lives.  Every day television programmes warn about moneylending and the lengths that moneylenders will go to in order to make people pay.  <\/p><p>I must say, and I purposely allowed this to happen, I signed a contract to buy a dongle for my computer.  Last February, I rang the company to cancel the contract but was informed that I had to give one month's notice which I agreed to do.  In March I left my direct debt stand and in April I cancelled it thinking that I was finished with the matter.  I then received a telephone from a reputable company claiming I owed money for March.  I informed them that I had paid by direct debit but the person on the other end of the line was horrible to me.  He was so obnoxious that I refused to deal with him and asked to speak to his supervisor.  Unfortunately, he was no better.  By the way, both men were not Irish people.  Even though the company is based in Ireland one must speak to a foreign person when dealing with such matters.  The supervisor did not treat me any better because he told me that I was trying to avoid paying a bill of &euro;14.  As a result I decided to let the bill run to see what would happen.  Every day since I have had three telephone calls from the company seeking &euro;14.  I have no problem paying &euro;14 and can afford to pay the sum.  I wanted to get a feel of what it is like to be harassed and to owe money.  I can now identify with people who have been harassed.  I said to my husband that if a company is willing to pursue me like that for &euro;14 what will it do when a person owes &euro;14,000 or mortgage money.  Obviously I will pay the &euro;14 or I shall be listed as a bad debtor.  The company has stopped ringing me in the past few days.  I presume that it will start sending me court letters so I had better pay the sum.  All of the Senators would talk about me if I was put on a list of debtors.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200043#TT00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1369238400,"counter":455,"content":"<p>There is no fear of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200043#TT00300","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1369238400,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Senator Bacik mentioned codifying crimes.

The more legislation that is introduced in the House the better.  Far too often motions are tabled and my party is as guilty of that as any other.  We are here to legislate and we have valuable legislation before us this evening.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, we are all becoming too familiar with moneylending.  Many families enter our constituency offices on a weekly basis.  They have told us about their concerns about unscrupulous moneylenders.  It is a traumatic experience for people who are in their grip.<\/p><p>Over the past six years more families have fallen prey to moneylenders, unlicensed moneylenders in the first instance but also licensed ones, who have acted in an unscrupulous manner.  The illegal moneylenders are of greater concern to us all.  Credit has increasingly become harder to secure and has led to people going to moneylenders.  There is high unemployment, wage cuts and social welfare cuts.  A range of benefits have been cut over the past five years in six budgets.  People are trying to pay their domestic bills even though they have less money in their pockets, less social welfare or have lost their jobs.  <\/p> <p>As a previous Senator remarked, people must pay high mortgages that they cannot afford.  Families are under all sorts of pressures to pay basic bills.  Any of the charities that work with those who are vulnerable will tell us that, increasingly, they are going to moneylenders to pay for basic bills.  There must be something wrong with that.  We must recognise that as a wrong which needs to be corrected.  Unfortunately, it is part of the impact of the wider austerity agenda on families.  According to Social Justice Ireland, the State's poorest families experienced a disposable income drop of almost 18.7% in 2000 alone, at the height of the Celtic tiger.  One can imagine how much worse matters have become for those families since, especially from 2008 onwards.<\/p><p>The &quot;What's Left&quot; tracker 2012, which was published by the Irish League of Credit Unions, provides a graphic picture of the human face behind these figures.  The report stated that 1.6 million families are left with &euro;100 or less each month when bills are paid.  That is a staggering number of families who are left with that level of disposable income.  When they are faced with increasing bills and an inability to get credit from banks or wherever, it is quite easy to see how many fall prey to moneylenders.<\/p><p>We also must acknowledge that there is considerable variety in the types of moneylenders.  Many are perfectly honest, above board, well-equipped, have proper procedures in place and deal with people in a fair way.  The word &quot;moneylending&quot; has negative connotations, but there are persons engaged in moneylending who are licensed moneylenders who behave in a responsible way.  Equally, there are many who do not and there are many unscrupulous ones.<\/p><p>We all have heard worrying and upsetting stories about the behaviour of some of the more unscrupulous moneylenders, especially when it pertains to debt collection.  Senator Marie Moloney gave an example of a company - it was not a moneylender - pursuing her for a small sum of money.  I certainly have had many stories recounted to me in my constituency office of persons who are being chased and harassed by moneylenders who are linked to big criminal gangs in Cork, Dublin and Limerick for money they owe.  In fact, I had a meeting with the chief superintendent in Waterford a year ago where there was one gang that was trying to control a housing estate and its communities and using moneylending as a way to get a grip on those communities.  In fairness, the Garda has been proactive in dealing with these individuals.<\/p><p>There is a need for tighter regulation in this area.  Fianna F&aacute;il's Bill is part of it, by putting a bar for a period on someone who has been convicted of the offence of unlicensed moneylending from communicating with or harassing any victims of that unlicensed behaviour.  The offence of unlicensed moneylending covers not only those directly involved, face to face in the act of moneylending but also those directing or aiding the act.  Dealing with the latter is vital, given that many of the more unscrupulous actors, as I stated earlier, get others to collect the debts for them.  They adopt an arm's length approach.  They lend the money but they have others collect it for them, and the type of practices used leave much to be desired.<\/p><p>Last year, my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty brought forward a Bill in the D&aacute;il to deal with this issue.  It was to amend the Consumer Credit Act 1995 to introduce a cap of 40% on the annual percentage rate a moneylender can charge a borrower.  The rate of 40% is reasonable in that one could make a handsome profit on the back of that, yet that Bill was voted down by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  The excuse given was that if the Bill was accepted, it could drive some moneylenders out of business.  If the consequence of introducing such a Bill drives some moneylenders out of business, I am all in favour of it.  If one cannot make a profit on the back of 40% APR, there is something seriously wrong.<\/p><p>We need more robust regulation and more supports.  We need to take the matter seriously and ensure we do what we can to help those who are victims of moneylending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200043#TT00500","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369239000,"counter":459,"content":"<p>The Bill is probably overdue.  I commend Senator MacSharry, as everybody else who has spoken has done, on his initiative in this regard.  In commending him, I would condemn the Minister for his failure to take this on board.  This is a real issue, as everybody in the House, whether on the Government or the Opposition benches, will be aware.  It is a terrible affliction on those who find themselves in this position.  We have seen many robust and illegal methods used to extract repayment from borrowers.  We are talking about borrowers who are the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in society.  This Bill deserved the Government's support in this regard.<\/p><p>Senator MacSharry has identified this as a growing problem.  While it concerns illegal moneylending, there are issues surrounding legal moneylenders as well which also need to come under focus.  The Senator is seeking to ensure the punishment is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence and that there would a prohibition on those convicted of unlicensed moneylending from harassing those who have been their clients.<\/p><p>Senator MacSharry might well go beyond that.  I would ask him to consider, because I am sure this Bill will return, perhaps in a different format, if it is voted down today, ensuring illegal moneylenders are aware that any contract they enter into would be regarded as being void by the State, in other words, an illegal moneylender would have no recourse to recovering his or her money legally and also there would be severe punishment for any strong-arm tactics to recover that money.<\/p><p>While I criticise the Minister for not dealing with this, it is fair to say that it is 40 years since RTE produced a programme on the issue.  At that stage the scourge of illegal moneylending was refuted by Members in this House and led to an inquiry which substantiated what was going on.<\/p><p>The fact that nobody has been convicted of illegal moneylending over the past seven or eight years at a time of harsh economic circumstances for most of the population shows the legislation is inadequate and is certainly not being enforced by the Garda.  In some instances, there is a reluctance among those who are caught up in this scenario to come forward and make a complaint because of the danger to which they feel themselves personally subjected.  We have heard of cases here, and for that matter in Northern Ireland, of collateral such as pension books, post office books and benefits being removed from clients or their having to attend at certain locations to hand over either their social welfare or pensions to these moneylenders.  The consequences for many have included not only threats but also physical assault and illegal seizure by moneylenders of the goods of borrowers.  Sometimes lenders force their victims to carry out illegal activities and commit offences, purely in order that they may extricate themselves from their difficulties.<\/p><p>It is past time we got much tougher with people who take advantage of those who are in difficulties.<\/p> <p>In my book, the reasons given by the Minister for not accepting this legislation do not stand up.  Moreover, the State is also aware that details regarding licensed moneylenders, which can be found on the Central Bank website, show some of the charges made are staggering.  I am told that in some instances, the annual percentage rate, APR, is as high as an incredible 287%.  I suggest this Bill, which constitutes a start in the right direction, should at least be kept on the Order Paper.  If the Minister believes it could be improved, by all means let him or others bring forward amendments to substantiate that.  However, Members should avoid doing what they did two years ago, when efforts were made to deal with the position regarding bankruptcy and insolvency.  They sat on the problem for a couple of years before legislation was passed, which actually gives all the cards to the banks.  People who are in financial difficulties cannot now resolve them unless the banks acquiesce.  Are Members stating those who are victims of moneylenders will be stuck in the same position, whereby they only will be able to extricate themselves from their difficulties if the moneylenders acquiesce?  That is an appalling situation to allow to continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200044#UU00200","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369239600,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Senator Jim D'Arcy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200045#VV00200","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1369239600,"counter":462,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

However, I find it extraordinary that some Members, including the last two speakers, have come into the Chamber without reading the Minister's response to the debate and the Bill's introduction.  I will quote two items from his speech.  He stated:<blockquote><br \/>The focus of today's debate is illegal moneylending, which is addressed by section 98 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  This prohibits any person from engaging in the business of moneylending without a licence.  Acting as an agent of an unlicensed moneylender is also prohibited.<\/blockquote>He then went on to outline what were the powers and to make the single point that sums up the whole lot, namely, &quot;The Bill effectively replicates offences which are already on the Statute Book&quot;.  In other words, the offences provided for in the Bill before Members are already covered by the Statute Book.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200045#VV00400","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1369239600,"counter":464,"content":"<p>In common with all previous speakers I find reprehensible illegal moneylending and the pressure it puts on people.

Senator MacSharry is a thoughtful politician all the time who presents his politics in a thoughtful way most of the time.  However, he has brought this matter to Members' attention.  In this context, I note that a young writer approached Mark Twain with his new novel and asked the author what he thought of it.  Mark Twain replied he had read it all before and when the writer protested that he could not have done so because he had just written it, Twain repeated that he had read it before.  When the writer asked where he had read it previously, Mark Twain replied, \"In the dictionary\".  It was words.<\/p><p>As Senator Cummins has noted, Members have been informed that thankfully, all of the contents of this Bill already are on the Statute Book.  Consequently, what is needed is enforcement and proper attention paid to the issue in order that people do not get into such terrible situations.

The most vulnerable people are being affected by these gangsters and thugs.  While the latter are the unlicensed operators, I also would include the licensed moneylenders in this regard.  I challenge the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator to check up on the licensed operators because I believe they are breaking the law and using heavy-handed bully-boy tactics to try to extract exorbitant interest rates from their vulnerable clients.  While Members have suggested people should go to MABS, these people are at their wits' end.

Given its location, it is crucially important the hospital is fully supported given the increased demand for beds at the hospital.<\/p><p>The hospital was established in 1958 and has served the community exceptionally well since then in no small way to the staff who work in it, both retired and current.  At present, according to HSE figures, there are 16 long-stay beds in the hospital and 19 short-stay beds, a total of 35 beds.  That is a reduction of ten beds in recent times, which has affected the capacity of the hospital to provide essential respite care and longer stay care for those in transition from hospital treatment or who may require accommodation in the nursing unit.<\/p><p>This issue has been raised by the local community at a public meeting.<\/p> <p>A public meeting was held on the issue and heard serious concerns from members of the community.  The problem boils down to one issue.  While I do not question the Health Service Executive's commitment to the long-term future of the hospital, the moratorium on the recruitment of staff has resulted in a lack of full support to the hospital.  In the past four to six weeks, long-term sick leave among staff has increased and other staff members have retired or gone on planned maternity leave.  The moratorium does not allow the HSE or hospital management to fill the vacant positions.  The Department must step in and allow some degree of flexibility to enable a recruitment process to proceed to replace staff on sick leave or maternity leave as well as those who have retired.<\/p><p>The Health Information and Quality Authority will not allow any more than 35 beds to be occupied under current staffing levels.  The facility has been well maintained and developed and in 2010 it benefited from an investment of between &euro;500,000 and &euro;600,000.  The issue at the hospital is entirely one of staffing.  <\/p><p>While the Health Service Executive may have the option of using agency staff, recruiting staff is a no-brainer in terms of the drain the agency option places on Exchequer resources.  Some degree of flexibility must be provided to allow community hospitals such as the facility in Dungloe to replace staff who are on sick leave or maternity leave, even if only for a short period.  It does not make sense that demand for services cannot be met because staff shortages cannot be addressed as a result of the moratorium on recruitment. <\/p><p>The Minister of State is aware of the issue I raise.  The Department must show flexibility if this problem is to be resolved, not only in Dungloe Community Hospital but other hospitals in a similar position.  The moratorium on recruitment in the public sector must be reviewed to meet the needs of patients in such hospitals.  This must be done quickly because patients and their families are being forced to avail of alternative services, both private and public, outside their catchment area.  In this case, the catchment area is a Gaeltacht area.  I hope the Minister of State has some good news.  The Government must give a commitment to address this important local issue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200047#XX00400","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369241100,"counter":504,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, as Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill will be aware from previous Adjournment debates, I will be reading a reply.<\/p><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue, which the Government is examining.  As he is aware, Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care, including the provision of financial assistance under the nursing homes support scheme. In 2012, with a budget of almost &euro;1 billion, financial support was provided to over 22,000 people in nursing homes.<\/p><p>These are challenging times for the Health Service Executive in respect of all services.  In the case of community nursing units, these include challenges regarding staffing, funding and the age and structure of its units.  In this regard, all developments have to be addressed in light of the current economic and budgetary pressures and any decisions taken by the HSE must have regard to this and the current recruitment moratorium.<\/p><p>As the Senator will be aware, Dungloe Community Hospital is located on the Gweedore Road, a short walk from the town centre.  The facility was registered with the Health Information and Quality Authority on 22 June 2012.  The registration period is three years and the current capacity is 35 beds.  This consists of 16 continuing care, six respite, three convalescence-rehabilitation, two palliative care and eight assessment beds.  The hospital also provides a wide range of care services, including a day hospital, outpatient clinics, an X-ray department and other specialist services, such as physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, mental health and social work. <\/p><p>Dungloe Community Hospital has recently experienced an increased number of staff retirements, long-term sick leave and maternity leave.  To maintain a safe level of care to patients, the Health Service Executive decided to temporarily reduce by ten the number of short-stay beds in the facility.  Long-stay beds are unaffected by the decision.  I understand six beds closed in the week ending 10 May, with the remaining four beds closing last week.  The decision to temporarily close the beds was taken to ensure there is an adequate number of staff to safely meet all of the needs of the residents.  This matter will be kept under constant review.  The hospital will continue to provide respite and rehabilitation care within its current capacity.  Additional respite services, if required, are available in Falcarragh Community Hospital.  The HSE has asked me to assure the House that residents at the hospital are receiving a safe and quality service.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to the provision of a quality public nursing home service.  Our overall objective is to protect the viability of as many units as possible, within the funding and staffing resources available.  The Department is working closely with the HSE to finalise an overall plan regarding future public provision.  The plan will reflect regional need and have regard to the current severe financial constraints, restrictions on public sector staffing and recruitment as well as the ongoing need to meet service and safety standards, all of which pose challenges for community nursing units across the country.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill can take some solace from the fact that we are fast running out of capacity in respect of nursing home beds. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200048#YY00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting Applications","time":1369241100,"counter":505,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200048#YY00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1369241100,"counter":506,"content":"<p>A central pillar of Government policy is to have large numbers of those who are currently without work gain meaningful employment as a means of resolving the economic crisis.  I commend the efforts the Government has made in this regard, including successfully increasing foreign direct investment, implementing two action plans for jobs and announcing a schools building programme.  Despite the recession, it also announced substantial capital expenditure on infrastructure under last year's stimulus plan.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding these positive developments, I propose to focus on how a policy of the Government or State agency is affecting the growth of jobs in east County Galway.  I am sure the issue I highlight is replicated across the country.  I am fully in favour of ensuring that all residents in my area have full accessibility to the workforce and that boundaries and barriers to work are eliminated through Government action.  To achieve anything of significance in this regard, we must address a delay that many people are experiencing in having applications to the Garda vetting unit processed.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides a great quality control service in processing vetting applications.  However, it is of the utmost importance that nothing comes between those who wish to work and access to employment.  People are waiting for months to obtain Garda clearance, which is acting as a major barrier to entry into the workforce.  Last year, in my home town of Athenry, 63 students who were studying various post-leaving certificate courses in the vocational college were prevented from undertaking work experience as part of their courses as a result of delays in obtaining Garda clearance.  Some of them also had placements withdrawn as a result, which essentially deemed them unemployable for the period of the delay.<\/p><p>I have also been contacted by a self-employed individual who had to cease work for a three-week period because he did not have the clearance required for the job he was undertaking.  This caused him financial hardship.  It is a terrible indictment of the current process that it deters and discourages people from entering the workforce.  Much of the problem with delays is caused by people making multiple applications for Garda clearance each year.  For instance, if someone needs clearance for his or her workplace, an application must be submitted to the Garda vetting unit.  If the same person wishes to train a children's sports team or work for a charity, he or she will have to submit separate applications for each purpose.<\/p><p>We must consider the number of job opportunities that are being lost as a result of these delays.  Will the Minister of State consider redeploying public servants to the vetting unit in Thurles to alleviate the delays being experienced?  Will the Department draw up plans to invest in technology that will help address the current delays in processing Garda vetting applications?  Greater efforts must be made to prioritise applicants who have been approved in previous months.<\/p> <p>I am not suggesting in the preceding years, obviously, because as the Minister of State knows well, people might have committed a crime that might be contrary to the spirit of the legislation and, in particular, the Garda vetting unit.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200048#YY00400","speaker":"1173","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369241700,"counter":508,"content":"<p>Unfortunately the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, cannot be here today so I am taking this Adjournment matter on his behalf.  While I am reluctant to say he has been detained elsewhere, that is actually the fact of the matter.<\/p><p>It is the intention of the Minister to ensure that the best possible vetting service is provided in this country and by extension, to ensure that the maximum protection possible is provided to the most vulnerable people in our society.  The vetting services in this country are provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the Garda central vetting unit.  The unit provides employment vetting, not Garda clearance, for a number of organisations in Ireland registered with the unit which employ personnel to work in a full-time, part time, voluntary or student capacity with children and\/or vulnerable adults.  The service provided is continually being extended, on a phased basis, to such organisations.  At present, approximately 20,000 organisations are registered with the central vetting unit and the unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.  <\/p><p>The Garda Commissioner has informed the Minister that one superintendent, two sergeants and approximately 113 civilian personnel are currently assigned to the Garda central vetting unit.  This civilian complement includes 23 staff recently transferred from Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who are undergoing required training.  A further 15 staff will commence their training later this month.  The current average processing time for applications is approximately 12 weeks from date of receipt.  There are, of course, seasonal fluctuations in average processing times and the processing time can also be affected where further inquiries have to be made, normally in respect of court outcomes and-or suspected offender details.  All organisations registered for Garda vetting are aware of the processing timeframes for the receipt of Garda vetting clearance and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.  <\/p><p>In order to observe equity and fairness in respect of all applicants for Garda vetting, standard processing procedures are such that applications are processed in chronological order, from the date of receipt at the central vetting unit.  Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the Garda central vetting unit and this must remain the case.  The Minister remains in contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best this service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the system.  The methodology currently utilised both in the training of appropriate personnel in registered organisations and the actual processing of applications for Garda vetting provides a direct working relationship between the unit and each organisation seeking Garda vetting disclosures in respect of prospective employees.  In doing so, the security, integrity, confidentiality and accountability of the overall Garda vetting process are protected.  This process also provides each registered organisation with Garda vetting disclosures which are up to date at the time of their assessment.  Critically, this also minimises the risk of false, forged or fraudulent Garda vetting disclosures being presented to employers by prospective employees.  Standard policy in place with registered organisations for Garda vetting is that the vetting subject gives written permission on a Garda vetting application form for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to disclose details of all prosecutions, successful or not, pending or completed and-or convictions, recorded in the State or elsewhere, in respect of them to the registered organisation.<\/p><p>All available resources at the Garda central vetting unit are fully deployed on an ongoing basis to provide for Garda vetting services to meet the demands of registered organisations.  The Minister fully agrees with the objective that processing times should be kept to a minimum, while maintaining the overall integrity of the vetting system.  In that regard, the Department of Justice and Equality is examining the scope for the redeployment of additional personnel from within the public service to the central vetting unit.  Regarding streamlining the process, the Minister, as pointed out earlier, remains in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best the service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the process.  Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the unit and this must remain the case.  In that context, it is essential that registered organisations have confidence in the system, a confidence which can only be underpinned by rigorous checking processes and access to the latest available accurate information on prospective personnel, who after all, are seeking to work with the most vulnerable members of our society.  In this regard, the possibility of introducing an e-vetting system has been assessed and the Garda authorities are now in the process of developing a system which will enable vetting applications to be submitted electronically through a secure web service.  In addition, the system will facilitate the checking and monitoring of applications.<\/p><p>The relevant work is being pursued on a priority basis and it will be completed as quickly as possible.  I can, on behalf of the Minister, reassure the Senator and the House that it is his intention to ensure that the most efficient and effective vetting service is provided by the Garda central vetting unit while, at the same time, providing the maximum protection possible to the most vulnerable people in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013052200049#ZZ00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1369241700,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.
