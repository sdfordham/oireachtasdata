The current Defence Forces contingent, the 46th Irish Infantry Group UNDOF, comprises 130 troops and consists of a Force Reserve Company and support elements. Their role includes the provision of a Quick Reaction Force which is on standby to assist with on-going operations within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility. In that capacity, in August 2014, the Irish contingent dealt with several incidents as requested by the Force Commander UNDOF. The Golan situation remains volatile as Syrian Arab Armed Forces and Anti Government Armed Elements continue to clash within the Area of Separation. The threat to Defence Forces personnel serving in Golan Heights on the Israeli occupied side is assessed as MODERATE and on the Syrian side is assessed as SUBSTANTIAL.  Eight (8) other Defence Forces personnel are also deployed in UNDOF Headquarters, Camp Ziouani, including the Acting Force Commander Brigadier General Anthony Hanlon. <br\/><br\/>Last September, given events on the ground, I called for the UN to undertake a review of the mission, particularly the capacity of the mission to fulfil its mandate in light of the civil war in Syria. Since then there has been a fundamental realignment of the UNDOF mission with a view to minimising unacceptable risks to peacekeepers, while continuing to implement the mission&rsquo;s mandate. The UN continues to review the mission and will provide regular updates on the mission to the Security Council in this regard.<br\/><br\/>During my visit to the Middle East last month, I had the opportunity of meeting the then Force Commander UNDOF, Lieutenant General Singha, and the Irish troops serving with the mission.

The national employer relations team and divisional employer liaison teams work closely with employers and industry bodies on an ongoing basis to support engagement with job seekers and the Department&rsquo;s employer services. In addition the www.jobsIreland.ie website is being redeveloped\/ upgraded to better respond to employer and client needs via a new job matching system on a successor site which should be in place by late 2015.<\/p><p>  As an example of this kind of engagement, officials from my Department met with Irish Water and the main contractors selected for the Water Metering Installation in 2013\/2014 and provided information on the services and supports available for employers through the Intreo service.  <\/p><p>  In addition Irish Water has advertised over 320 positions for roles in Irish Water through the Department&rsquo;s Jobs Ireland service &ndash; www.jobsireland.ie.

The Department of Social Protection provides a range of employment supports to jobseekers, including persons currently on mortgage interest supplement. Supports include career advice and guidance, information on and access to suitable further education and training opportunities, advice on employment incentives and supports and access to internships and employment programmes.<\/p><p>  Where a jobseeker in receipt of mortgage interest supplement takes up temporary employment greater than 30 hours per week and does not qualify for the supplement, they may have their payment generally suspended for up to 8 weeks and re-instated after this period.  I would advise any person in receipt of mortgage interest supplement who is taking up temporary employment to discuss their individual circumstances with the officer in the Community Welfare Service administering their claim.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400051#WRB03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Offices","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400051#WRB03300"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[49471\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400051#WRB03400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when she will have an Intreo office fully operational in Swords, County Dublin.","asker":"1192","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>The INTREO service in Swords will be a single, integrated service delivered over two sites: Fingal County Hall, Swords and Mainscourt, Swords.

She was employed as a polling clerk for one day last year. A person in receipt of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance is entitled to work in paid employment for up to 15 hours per week and any such income from employment is assessed as means. In this regard, a couple can have means of up to &euro;665 per week without affecting entitlement to a maximum rate of either a full-rate or half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance payment. Payment is reduced at a tapered rate (50%) where means are in excess of &euro;665 per week. Accordingly, the income form employment as a polling clerk did not affect the rate of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance payable. <\/p><p>  When the spouse of a person in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is in employment, his or her earnings are assessed as means for the purposes of establishing the level of entitlement to the payment. Means are assessed by applying a &euro;20 earnings disregard per day worked (up to a maximum of &euro;60), with the remainder of earnings assessed at 60%. <\/p><p>  In the case in question, the spouse worked for one day as a polling clerk and earned &euro;350.00.  The means assessment was calculated as follows:<\/p><p>  &euro;350.00 - &euro;20 (disregard) = &euro;330.00 x 60% = &euro;198.00 weekly means. <\/p><p>  These means reduced the level of entitlement for the week in question by &euro;198 and an overpayment of this amount arose. In the case of the individual concerned, there was a previous overpayment of &euro;134.10, which accounted for a total overpayment position of &euro;332.10. <\/p><p>  Employment as a polling clerk is treated in the same manner as any other form of employment in relation to means testing.  There are currently no plans to make any changes to these arrangements.  It is considered that the current arrangements offer sufficient incentive for jobseekers and other means tested recipients including qualified adults to engage in employment, as earnings as assessed on a partial basis only and weekly or daily income disregards apply. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400052#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Back to Work Allowance","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400052#WRC01600"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[49673\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400052#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 171 of 16 December if she will clarify the final paragraph of her reply wherein she makes reference to the second year of a business plan; if there is an entitlement to a jobseeker's payment in the first year of the back to work enterprise allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>The key principles of the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) were set out in my December reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s question.

A statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to contribute to their pension scheme has never existed.  The level of employer and employee contributions is agreed and established in contract in the Trust Deeds and Rules of each scheme when a pension scheme is established. The imposition of such an obligation on employers has been considered on a number of occasions in recent years. The issue was last considered in the preparation of the measures included in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013. However, it was decided not to proceed with such a measure given the current economic circumstances, uncertainties as to the overall impact on such a measure and the potential for unintended consequences.<br\/><br\/>I am aware that many pension schemes are encountering funding difficulties at this time.<br\/><br\/>A number of legislative measures have been put in place to assist employers and trustees of pension schemes respond to these difficulties.

I am keeping this matter under close review. However, raising rent limits may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and could impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers, their families and students. Increasing housing supply and the reactivation of the construction activity is a key issue for Government and is critical to restoring stability to the rental market.<br\/><br\/>The Department is taking measures to ensure that the housing needs of rent supplement customers who are in danger of becoming homeless are being addressed by providing for increased flexibility within the administration of the scheme. A notice reminding all staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated during 2014 and a further instruction recently issued in December 2014 to ensure that there is consistency throughout the country.  <br\/><br\/>The tenancy sustainment protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations is designed to protect families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation from becoming homelessness and payment in excess of the rent limits are being made for some 290 families in the Dublin region. The protocol will be shortly extended to Cork city and staff in the Department are engaging with Cork City Council and non-Government organisations in this regard. Staff outside the Dublin region are also increasing rent supplement payments as necessary and are actively engaging with the relevant local authority and various local organisations involved in homelessness.  <br\/><br\/>Where a person in receipt of rent supplement is at risk of losing their tenancy they should make contact with the Tenancy Protection Service provided by Threshold in Dublin or to their local Community Welfare Service.<br\/><br\/>Rent supplement recipient numbers by county and information on expenditure since 2010 is provided in the attached tabular statements. The table shows that there are currently over 1,700 rent supplement recipients in Meath, of which nearly one third of these claims were awarded during 2014. A breakdown on claim duration by county or by reasons customers exit the scheme is not available.

Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.  <\/p><p>  The Government has no plans to change this policy, and I have not been presented with any plans from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to reduce the basic rate of the State pension.  In fact, the Government increased payments for certain pensioners by increasing the rate of the Living Alone Allowance in Budget 2015 to &euro;9.00.<\/p><p>  This increases the maximum personal rate of the State non-contributory pension for a qualified person living alone to &euro;228 per week, and the maximum rate for the contributory pension to &euro;239.30, when both the basic pension and the allowance are taken into account.  <\/p><p>  The most recent change in the core rate of State pensions was in Budget 2009, when the State pension contributory was increased by 3.1% to &euro;230.30, and the non-contributory pension by 3.3% to &euro;219.00.  Both of these are the maximum personal rates, and there are increases for dependant adults which attracted similar increases at that time. <\/p><p>  Core pension rates were not reduced in the period since then, despite significant pressures on Exchequer spending, and a period of significant deflation which has protected those increases in real terms from erosion by inflation.  This has had the effect of protecting older people from poverty, and all CSO figures show that those over 65 are significantly less likely to be at risk of poverty or deprivation than those aged under 65, whichever measure is used.<\/p><p>  The recovery has also allowed us some leeway to increase spending in targeted areas, which is why I was able to restore a partial Christmas bonus last month, benefitting over 575,000 pensioners and 1.23 million welfare recipients in total.<\/p><p>  I am aware of an options paper that was prepared by an official in the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform which considered the arguments for a reduction in a number of payment rates, including that of the State pension, and this may be the basis of the question asked by the Deputy.

A number of both legislative and administrative changes have been made in recent years to assist employer and the trustees of pension schemes address the funding challenges facing such schemes. <\/p><p>  The most recent changes to pension legislation extended the options available to the trustees of a pension scheme in any consideration of a restructure of scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pension Act to include a portion of pensioner benefits.  Prior to this change, the trustees of a scheme could only consider the benefit of active and deferred scheme members in any restructure of scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act.  Any consideration of a restructure of pensioner benefits is limited to up to 10% of benefit where the annual pension is greater than &euro;12,000 and less than &euro;60,000.  Pension over &euro;60,000 can be reduced by up to 20%.  Pensions up to &euro;12,000 cannot be reduced.

While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.

The reasons for exclusion from participation in the scheme vary and include issues such as poor quality internships, that there is evidence of employment displacement, that the internship as operated did not reflect that which was advertised and that Standard Agreement was not completed as required.<br\/><br\/>Following the announcement of the Youth Developmental Internship, when the T&aacute;naiste invited expressions of interest from potential host organisations, the Department has undertaken a number of actions to develop and promote interest in the scheme. In addition to contacting a range of potential host organisations the Department has also contacted the Education and Training Board Ireland (ETBI) to develop a one week work preparation course.  It is envisaged that the first intake of participants will be in March\/April 2015.<br\/><br\/>The Department, in the immediate future, will provide for quantitative evaluation of a number of programmes through econometric analysis of post-programme outcomes for participants and for control groups of non-participants.  The evaluation approach will be based on learning from a &ldquo;pathfinder&rdquo; evaluation of the Back to Education Allowance currently close to finalisation by ESRI, exploiting data from a longitudinal jobseekers&rsquo; database developed by the Department.  This project is establishing the extent to which the data, and the available evaluation techniques, are able to produce insights sufficient to support policy choices and the assessment of the costs and benefits of alternative approaches.  Building on the outcome of the pathfinder project, it is intended to launch structured, econometric, evaluation(s) of a number of further programmes, including JobBridge, in 2015.<br\/><br\/>Participation in JobBridge is voluntary therefore prospective interns are free to apply for internships which are of interest to them.  As such PEX is not a determining factor for participation and the data regarding PEX as requested by the question is not routinely recorded as part of the JobBridge process.<br\/><br\/>The Department receives employer supplied progression data at the end of each internship which outlines the reason for the completion of the internship.  This information will form part of the econometric evaluation examining progression rates for a number of activation programmes as outlined above.<br\/><br\/>In general the cooling off period applies to all host organisations as per the scheme guidelines.  In cases where the cooling off period is waived this is done on a case by case basis, and as such statistics are not maintained.<br\/><br\/>From July, 2011, some 65,686 internship positions have been advertised by host organisations, of which 29,387 internship have not been filled.<br\/><br\/><b>Table 1: Breakdown of JobBridge Host Organisations by number of interns (<\/b>As at 8 January, 2015)<table><tr><th>Number of Interns<\/th><th>Number of Host Organisations<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>1-4<\/td><td>14,703<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5-9<\/td><td>764<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10-20<\/td><td>239<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>21-50<\/td><td>98<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>51-100<\/td><td>31<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Over 100<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>15,843<\/td><\/tr><\/table><blockquote><\/blockquote><b>Table 2: Breakdown of JobBridge Interns by Government Department\/Agency (<\/b>As at 8 January, 2015)<table><tr><th>Host Organisation<\/th><th>Total Interns<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>D\/Agriculture Food and Marine<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D\/Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D\/Communications, Energy and Natural Resources<\/td><td>43<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D\/Defence<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D\/Education and Skills<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D\/Environment, Community and Local Government<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D\/Finance<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D\/Health<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D\/Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D\/Justice and Equality<\/td><td>95<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D\/Public Expenditure and Reform<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D\/Social Protection<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D\/Taoiseach<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D\/ Transport, Tourism and Sport<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Houses of the Oireachtas<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Office of the Attorney General<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Office<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ombudsman&rsquo;s Office<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Pensions Ombudsman&rsquo;s Office<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Office of the Secretary General to the President<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Revenue Commissioners<\/td><td>19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Valuation Office<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Teagasc<\/td><td>160<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TOTAL<\/td><td>486<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/><b>Table 3: Breakdown of JobBridge Interns by Age  (<\/b>As at 8 January, 2015)<table><tr><th>Age Range<\/th><th>Total Interns since Scheme Commenced<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Under 25<\/td><td>10,125<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>25-34 years<\/td><td>15,614<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>35-44 years<\/td><td>6,408<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>45-54 years<\/td><td>3,312<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Over 55 years<\/td><td>975<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>36,434<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400054#WRE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Guarantee","counter":215,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400054#WRE02350"},{"type":"question","counter":216,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[1587\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400054#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of jobseeker's under 25 years of age by county in tabular form who to date have been offered and completed a personal progression plan as part of the youth guarantee; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[1588\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400054#WRE02500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of jobseeker's under 25 years on a PEX score basis in tabular form who have been offered and completed a personal progression plan as part of the youth guarantee; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":218,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 88 together.<br\/><br\/>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in the format requested.

Companies who sign the Charter are agreeing to engage with the Department in relation to supporting a number of activities which will benefit unemployed people &ndash; particularly long-term and young unemployed people &ndash; find a route back into employment. There are three main areas of activities which a company may be involved in:<br\/><br\/>- Considering potential candidates from the live register as part of the recruitment process.  Companies who sign the Charter guarantee that at least 50% of candidates to be considered for interview will be taken from the live register;<br\/><br\/>- Providing training\/work experience opportunities, and<br\/><br\/>- Providing employability supports including information sessions for jobseekers and advice\/guidance in relation to job search, CV preparation and interview skills.<br\/><br\/>Given the early stage of rollout of the charter, data is not yet available in regard to its impact on employment of people from the live register.

The Intreo Centre is a one-stop shop for all income and employment support services where customers can access job-seeking advice, information on vacancies and income support services all in the one place. The local Intreo Centre provides expert help and advice on employment, training and personal development opportunities with a focus on customer needs to help them enter the workforce. Self-service kiosks are available to provide information and case officers offer advice and guidance on employment and training opportunities. The individualised supports which are available to jobseekers assist them in getting back to work and increasing their employability.    There are a number of key elements which make up the Intreo service including:<\/p><p>- Integrated reception providing a one-stop shop incorporating all strands of the Department&rsquo;s income support and employment services.<\/p><p>- Provision of information and access to income supports, including jobseekers' payments, back to work and back to education payments, one-parent family payments and community welfare services. Integrated decision-making process leading to quicker payment decisions.<\/p><p>- Intreo has introduced a new approach to engagement with people who are unemployed. It transforms the nature and level of engagement between employment services and people on the Live Register with the objective of helping people on the pathway back to employment. The aim is that the first day a client enters an Intreo Centre and engages with the service, that day is the start of the journey back to work.<\/p><p>  Currently these new Intreo services are not provided to our customers in County Monaghan and following the review mentioned above the Department has decided that these enhanced services can best be provided by utilising the capacity of Branch Offices in Monaghan Town, Castleblayney, and the Intreo Centre in Cavan Town.  The Department is confident that by adopting this approach we can better serve the needs of our customers by providing the broad range of Intreo services much sooner than would otherwise be the case.<\/p><p>  To ensure a smooth transition, and to minimise disruption to our customers, each customer has been assigned to the next closest DSP service in accordance with their geographic location. They have therefore been aligned with Branch Offices in Monaghan Town, Castleblayney, or the DSP Intreo Centre in Cavan. This re-configuration will provide customers with access to enhanced activation services and those attending Cavan Town will benefit immediately.  Customers attending the Monaghan Town Branch Office will also benefit from the proposed participation of that office in Intreo trials during 2015.<\/p><p>  Customers who reside more than 16 kilometres from their assigned Branch Office\/Intreo Centre may avail of postal signing arrangement whereby they sign a postal declaration two months out of three and sign in the Branch\/Intreo Office on the third month.  The Department is communicating in writing to each customer regarding the operational changes detailing their new DSP access point and signing arrangements.  Customers will be informed that there will be no changes to current payment arrangements.<\/p><p>  Department services such as Social Welfare Inspector, Designated Officer (former Community Welfare Officer) and Local Employment Services will not be affected by this change and will continue to be provided in Clones for customers and the general public as normal.<\/p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s operations are reviewed on an ongoing basis with a view to ensuring our services meet customer needs in as efficient a manner as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400056#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":264,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400056#WRG00750"},{"type":"question","counter":265,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[1799\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400056#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide in tabular form the number of EU directives which remain to be implemented within her Department; the name of these directives; the timeframe for the implementation of these directives; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":266,"content":"<p>The Department is, at present, responsible for the transposition of one EU Directive as outlined below.

In the specific case to which the Deputy refers, the person in question lodged a claim for full exemption but was advised that he did not meet the conditions for exemption as he is employed on a full-time basis.<br\/><br\/>The person subsequently lodged a claim for relief under Section 15A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended). This particular relief takes the form of a reduction in the chargeable value of a property that has been adapted to make it more suitable for occupation by a disabled person. \u00a0It is important to note that the chargeable value is not reduced by the actual cost of the adaptation work but, instead, is reduced by the amount (if any) by which the chargeable value has increased as a result of the adaptation work, i.e. the amount of the chargeable value that is directly attributable to the adaptation work.  Even relatively substantial adaptations, such as the construction of additional rooms, may not have the effect of moving a property into a higher valuation band given that valuation bands cover a span of &euro;50,000. \u00a0This means that, for many properties, there might not be any net effect for LPT purposes as a result of adaptation work.<br\/><br\/>In this case, the person valued his property at &euro;200,000 at 1 May 3013, putting the property in the valuation band of &euro;150,001 to &euro;200,000. This property would have required a reduction in its chargeable value of at least &euro;50,000 to move into the next lower valuation band of &euro;100,001 to &euro;150,000. As the person spent &euro;50,000 on adaptation work, the chargeable value of the property would have increased by less than this amount. In any event, there is an upper limit on the allowable reduction in a property's chargeable value of\u00a0the lower of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work and the maximum local authority grant that would have been payable (if the person had availed of such a grant) when the adaptation work was carried out. The maximum local authority grant that would have been payable in this case would have been &euro;20,320 or &euro;12,700 (if the property was less than 12 months old at the time).\u00a0 Regardless of which of these limits would have applied, neither would be sufficient for the property to move into the lower valuation band of &euro;150,001 to &euro;200,000. <br\/><br\/>In this case, the adaptation work that was carried out does not have the effect of moving the property into a lower valuation band with the result that there is no change in the amount of LPT payable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400058#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inni&uacute;lacht sa Ghaeilge sa St&aacute;t Seirbh&iacute;s","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400058#WRJ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[1431\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400058#WRJ01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"bunaithe ar an treoir a thug an Roinn Caiteachas Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe do gach Roinn, cad &eacute; l&iacute;on agus cad iad gr&aacute;id na bpost d&aacute; mbeidh st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh at&aacute; inni&uacute;il sa Ghaeilge agus sa Bh&eacute;arla ag teast&aacute;il; cad &eacute; l&iacute;on na bpost sin a bhfuil duine leis an gcumas cu&iacute; Gaeilge agus B&eacute;arla iontu cheana f&eacute;in, arna bhriseadh s&iacute;os de r&eacute;ir gr&aacute;id; c&eacute;n ch&aacute;il&iacute;ocht Ghaeilge at&aacute; riachtanach do na poist sin; i gc&aacute;s nach bhfuil an treoir &oacute;n Roinn Caiteachais Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe comhl&iacute;onta, cad &eacute; &uacute;dar na moille agus c&eacute;n uair a dh&eacute;anfar an scr&uacute;d&uacute;; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":384,"content":"<p>N&iacute; gn&aacute;ch leis an Roinn seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il don phobal go d&iacute;reach.

Persons interested in serving on a board should apply via the State Boards portal run by PAS at .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400060#WRL02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pensions Reform","counter":507,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400060#WRL02650"},{"type":"question","counter":508,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[1074\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400060#WRL02700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will not cut the basic rates of State pension as this will have dire consequences on the pensioners who are rapidly reaching the poverty line; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":509,"content":"<p>Responsibility for the State Pension lies with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.

According to assessments made by the European Commission and other European bodies, a comprehensive TTIP could over time boost the EU's GDP by 0.5% per annum, resulting in 400,000 additional jobs across the EU.  Ireland has particularly strong economic links with the US, with over 118,000 people employed in 585 US companies here.  The total level of trade (imports and exports) between Ireland and the US in 2012 was &euro;55 billion.  The US is Ireland biggest merchandise export market.  The most recent data from the CSO shows that Ireland&rsquo;s services exports to the US increased by 40% in 2012.  Notwithstanding the present high level of trade enormous benefits could be derived from a comprehensive and ambitious TTIP.<br\/><br\/>My Department has commissioned a study on the potential impact of the TTIP for Ireland.  This study is intended to assist in guiding the Irish position in the negotiations.  The study is expected to be finalised in January 2015 and published in early 2015.<br\/><br\/>The initial findings by Copenhagen Economics show that the benefit to Ireland would be more than double the EU average, with 1.1% added to GDP.  Other preliminary findings include increased exports (2.7%), increases in real wages (1.4%) and investment (1.6%).  Opportunities are expected mainly in manufacturing &ndash; pharmaceutical and chemical industry, electrical machinery and other advanced machinery; services &ndash; insurance and ICT and Agriculture and processed foods.<br\/><br\/>A total of seven rounds of negotiations in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) have taken place to date, the most recent during the week beginning 29 September last year in the US.  A summary of each of the Rounds is included in the reply to Question No 179 [48982\/14] of 18 December 2015.<br\/><br\/>The next round of negotiations is scheduled to take place in Brussels during the week of 2 February 2015.<br\/><br\/>On 7 January, 2015, the EU Commission published a number of documents, all of which can be found at .<br\/><br\/>Included in the published documents are some of the EU&rsquo;s proposals for legal text in the TTIP that have been tabled for discussion with the US.  The areas covered by the texts published are competition, food safety and animal and plant health, customs issues, technical barriers to trade, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and government-to-government dispute settlement.  The EU Commission also published EU position papers explaining the EU's approach in the areas of engineering, vehicles, and sustainable development.  This brings to 15 the total number of published EU position papers on TTIP.  In addition, the EU Commission has published readers guides to the documents it has made available explaining what each text means, a glossary of terms and acronyms, and a series of factsheets that set out in plain language what is at stake in each chapter of TTIP and what the EU's aims are in each area.  I very much welcome the openness and transparency which will help to demystify the negotiations.<br\/><br\/>The EU Commission published its report on the results of the public consultation on investor protection on 13 January, 2015.

The price of fuel is dictated by global factors and reflects global market price (traded in dollars), Euro\/Dollar fluctuations, refining costs, transportation costs, other operating costs, prevailing Excise Duty and VAT.  The National Consumer Agency, now part of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, carried out a survey in 2008 in relation to the underlying reasons why pump prices for petrol and diesel were appearing not to fall in line with the drop in the wholesale price of oil.  The related Report&rsquo;s overall finding was that, at national level, price changes for refined petroleum products are being passed on to Irish consumers in a relatively timely fashion.  The report noted in particular, that the prices that Irish retailers charge for oil products relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil.  The refinery price for oil products varies with demand and does not always move in line with crude oil prices.  There is a time lag between movements in crude prices and refined prices.<br\/><br\/>The former Agency&rsquo;s report also found that, in the main, as well as price changes for refined petroleum products being passed on to consumers in a relatively timely fashion, that profits of oil companies involved in the downstream supply of refined oil product supplies in Ireland were relatively modest and that many fuel retailers were becoming more and more dependent on non-fuel retail offerings to sustain revenue and margin opportunities.  The Agency's report did highlight the importance of the availability of price information in terms of empowering consumers to achieve the best value for money when purchasing liquid fuel products.<br\/><br\/>Many international studies have identified that petrol and diesel prices tend to rise faster than they decline, and that this is likely due to a time lag between when the retailers learn that wholesale prices will be changing and when consumers learn this and begin to more actively shop around.<br\/><br\/>The Retail Price (Diesel and Petrol) Display Order 1997 (S.I. No 178 of 1997) requires all persons selling certain fuel products to specify by way of a public notice on their premises the price per litre being charged to the consumer for these commodities.  Accordingly, I would strongly encourage consumers to inform themselves of the different price offerings in their localities so as to enable them to proactively seek out the best value when purchasing fuel products.<br\/><br\/>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is the independent statutory body responsible for enforcing competition law in the State and has a statutory role in monitoring compliance with this law and ensuring that petrol and diesel prices are accurately and accessibly displayed.  As the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission can investigate anti-competitive practices on its own initiative or on foot of complaints received, any evidence (past or present) of anticompetitive arrangements in the wholesale and retail market for petrol, diesel and home heating oil should be brought to the attention of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400062#WRN04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registered Employment Agreements","counter":588,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400063#WRO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":589,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[49620\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400063#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if a sectoral registered employment agreement as provided for in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2014 will be enforceable where workers are employed by a subcontractor.","asker":"1080","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":590,"content":"<p>The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2014 will provide for a new statutory framework for establishing minimum rates of remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment for a specified type, class or group of workers, in a particular economic sector.

I am glad to inform the Deputy that IDA Ireland&rsquo;s end of year results show that 2014 was another record year for investment wins and job creation, with over 7,000 net new jobs being created in the Agency&rsquo;s client companies.  Total employment at IDA Ireland client companies now stands at 174,488 people, the highest level in the history of IDA Ireland.<br\/><br\/>I have been working with my Department on the development on a framework for the formulation of Regional Enterprise Strategies that will enable us to identify the sustainable competitive strengths of each region and to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprise growth and jobs in areas of potential.  A key element of this process is the Regional Enterprise Forum, which I chairedin Athlone on 19 December last.  I hope to publish the framework strategy shortly.  The Regional strategy will be rolled out firstly in the Midlands before being rolled out in other regions and will include specific actions and targets on the part of my Department, the enterprise development agencies and other public bodies to promote enterprise growth and job creation in the region.<br\/><br\/><b>TABLE A<\/b><br\/><br\/><b>Table shows the total number of IDA Ireland jobs,

Employment data for Enterprise Ireland is collected annually as part of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Annual Employment Survey which measures the number of jobs in Agency assisted client companies.  In its &ldquo;End of Year Statement&rdquo; published on Monday, January 12, Enterprise Ireland reported that client companies created 19,705 new jobs in 2014.  This resulted in a net increase of 8,476 in the total number of people employed by Enterprise Ireland supported companies.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus is on the economic benefits that can be achieved through its financial supports.  All financial approvals are underpinned by a continued focus on ensuring positive economic impact and value for money for the taxpayer.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s investments have also performed favourably over the years in terms of financial return on the investment.<br\/><br\/>Enterprise Ireland financially supports a significant number of Irish companies across the company developmental lifecycle by way of equity and grant aid, a high proportion of these being start-ups in an early stage of development.  Investing in early stage companies is inherently risky, particularly in the very early stages of company development.<br\/><br\/>Many of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s early stage companies require substantial funding to develop a final market offering.  Enterprise Ireland, when making an investment, will always seek that the company raises matching funding from the private sector or that they invest off their own Balance Sheet to support the particular project or company development.  This private sector participation can come from a diverse range of sources of capital and debt.<br\/><br\/>In order to reduce the investment risk Enterprise Ireland also requires that the private sector&rsquo;s funding contribution must constitute at least 50% or more of the total funding support.  This ensures that the private sector shares a larger proportion of the investment risk.  Commercial success however is never guaranteed.<br\/><br\/>In the case of grant aid, the company has to provide evidence of expenditure on their part before a grant payment is released.<br\/><br\/>The total amount of income generated through equity gains and grant repayments to Enterprise Ireland (grant refunds, dividends and redemption\/sale of shares), over the period 2011 to 2014, amounted to &euro;119m (Table 1).<br\/><br\/>Enterprise Ireland writes off investments where a company is being liquidated or is being wound up.  The average level of impairment (write-offs) associated with Enterprise Ireland equity investments in client companies that fail (based on investment periods of ten years and older) is 21%.  Before any investment or grant is written off Enterprise Ireland conducts a thorough due diligence process to ensure that all monies, if any, which are recoverable by Enterprise Ireland, have been recovered.<br\/><br\/>These impairments can be attributed to companies not achieving market success, in what has been a difficult economic period.<br\/><br\/>These losses have to be considered within the wider economic and monetary gains generated through the EI equity portfolio.  EI continues to actively manage the balance of its portfolio with a view to maximising the economic benefits and the financial return.<br\/><br\/><b>Income generated through equity gains and grant repayments to Enterprise Ireland<\/b><table><tr><th><\/th><th>Provisional<\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2014<\/td><td>2013<\/td><td>2012<\/td><td>2011<\/td><td>Total<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>&euro;'000<\/td><td>&euro;'000<\/td><td>&euro;'000<\/td><td>&euro;'000<\/td><td>&euro;'000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Expenditure<\/td><td>95,250<\/td><td>93,615<\/td><td>106,099<\/td><td>109,191<\/td><td>404,155<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Income<\/td><td>30,818<\/td><td>27,654<\/td><td>22,332<\/td><td>38,209<\/td><td>119,013<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400063#WRO02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Enterprise Offices","counter":615,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400063#WRO02900"},{"type":"question","counter":616,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[1118\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400063#WRO03000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the total number of local enterprise office and previously county enterprise board supported clients on a county basis and in the case of Dublin, a breakdown between Dublin City, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin for 2012, 2013 and 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It is expected that the information will be available later this Quarter.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy will be aware that the system for delivery of support to micro and small enterprises was reformed last year to make the operating environment for businesses more coherent, responsive and conducive to entrepreneurship at local level.  The LEOs are now the first-stop-shop for those beginning a new business as well as those wishing to expand their existing one. The LEOs provide financial and non-financial supports to help micro and small businesses to expand their growth potential and the LEO staff can advise clients directly or direct them to the most appropriate source of support for their project.<br\/><br\/>As part of the process of restructuring the enterprise supports for micro-enterprises, the metrics previously being used by the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) were revised and extended to make them more relevant as a means of reporting on the performance of the LEOs.<br\/><br\/>Each LEO is developing a Local Enterprise Development Plan for 2015 which will aim at further boosting enterprise growth within the area within their remit by building on the achievements to date and setting targets for job creation and enterprise growth in their area.  Key targets in the Plans will include new business start-ups, business expansions and jobs created or sustained as well as wider economic impacts such as exports, mentoring, training and enterprise promotion.

Resources normally invested in inspection work were assigned to this initiative.  Over 50 such talks were held and were attended by over 2,000 farmers.<br\/><br\/>I am particularly concerned at the high level of farm fatalities and it goes without saying that safety in agriculture will continue to be a high priority for the HSA and for the Government in 2015.<br\/><br\/>I have addressed this issue on a number of occasions at events such as the Ploughing Championships, the HSA\/NISO Conference and, most recently, with my EU level colleagues at the December EU EPSCO Council.<br\/><br\/>I met with Commissioner Marianne Thyssen in early December and we discussed the increased rate of fatalities in on farms and how to strengthen links between mainstream occupational, safety and health (OSH) policies and other EU policies in fields such as agriculture that have a high workplace accident record.  I am pleased to see from recent reports that Commissioner Hogan is considering how CAP incentives might be linked to compliance with farm safety practices.<br\/><br\/>Looking at what we can do nationally, the HSA adopts a broad based partnership approach to maximise its impact across the agriculture sector.  To this end the Farm Safety Partnership (FSP) includes among others representatives from all the farming organisations, the Department of Agriculture and Teagasc as well as my own Department.  An example of this collaborative approach is the launch in April 2014 by the HSA and Minister Coveney of the &quot;Safe Slurry handling&quot; DVD.  This DVD was produced in partnership with Irish Rural Link and this was made possible through a &euro;50k grant payment from my Department to the HSA.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the new approach to enforcement by the Authority under which it will (on a case by case basis) consider going straight to prosecution on certain matters which involve a very high risk of serious injury or death e.g. unguarded PTO assemblies.<br\/><br\/>The HSA will also be extending BeSMART &ndash; the free online risk assessment and safety statement tool to the agriculture sector in 2016, facilitating easy compliance with requirements and raising awareness of a risk based approach to health and safety.<br\/><br\/>Finally, the advisory and enforcement activity of the HSA complements the suite of programmes developed by the Department of Agriculture.  For example the Farm Safety Scheme which opened in October last year and aims to improve the standard of safety on Irish farms by providing grant-aid for a number of specified investment items.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400063#WRO04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1067"},{"type":"question","counter":632,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[1124\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400063#WRO04600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the discussions he or officials in his Department have held since 2011 with the Department for Agriculture and Food in relation to farm safety issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":633,"content":"<p>I am particularly concerned at the high level of farm fatalities and it goes without saying that safety in agriculture will continue to be a high priority for the HSA and for the Government in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  As the HSA and the Department of Agriculture and Food have a common interest in promoting safe working in the agriculture sector opportunities for collaborative action are proactively sought and maximised.<\/p>  <p>  In May 2014, prior to my appointment, a joint statement was issued by Minister Bruton and Minister Coveney highlighting farm safety and the unacceptable level of fatalities.  At that time both Ministers appealed to farmers and all involved in the agriculture sector to increase their safety awareness and ensure that safety became part of a daily routine.<\/p>  <p>  Since my appointment I have attended the National Ploughing Championships where I met farming representatives and discussed the prevention of farm accidents.  I also assisted the HSA and Teagasc in launching their joint Farm Safety and Health Training Programme.  At this launch I emphasised the good working relationship between the two state agencies working towards a common goal.<\/p>  <p>  Last December the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Simon Coveney TD and I attended the launch of &ldquo;Too Cold for Sharks&rdquo;, a children&rsquo;s publication for families involved in fishing.

The number of investments approved in each individual year from 2011 to 2014 is set out in the attached tabular statement.

Given these factors it is not possible to give an accurate figure for the number of projects which proceed and which do not proceed.  <br\/><br\/>The level of investments coming on stream is best measured by the number of new jobs created in any given year as recorded in the Forfas Annual Employment Survey, which tracks the jobs gained and lost in companies that are supported by enterprise development agencies.  Preliminary results from that survey show that in 2014 client companies of IDA Ireland created a total of 15,012 gross new jobs.  When job losses are taken into account the survey shows that 7,131 net jobs were created during 2014 as opposed to 5,595 in 2011.

There was a notable rise in new name investments with 88 new name investments being secured in 2014.  For a variety of reasons many companies do not wish for any publicity surrounding a proposed investments and many projects proceed without being publicly announced.

The announcements lists for the period 2011 to 2014 are attached at Table B.<br\/><br\/>In relation to the impact of those investments, it is important to acknowledge the natural time lag between an announcement of an investment and the coming on stream of that project which can be between 3 and 5 years in some cases.

Total employment at IDA Ireland client companies now stands at 174,488 people, the highest level in the history of IDA Ireland.  <br\/><br\/>I have been working with my Department on the development on a framework for the formulation of Regional Enterprise Strategies that will enable us to identify the sustainable competitive strengths of each region and to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprise growth and jobs in areas of potential.  A key element of this process is the Regional Enterprise Forum, which I chaired in Athlone on 19<sup>th<\/sup>December last.  I hope to publish the framework strategy shortly.  The Regional strategy will be rolled out firstly in the Midlands before being rolled out in other regions and will include specific actions and targets on the part of my Department, the enterprise development agencies and other public bodies to promote enterprise growth and job creation in the region.<br\/><br\/><b>NEW IDA IRELAND-SUPPORTED JOBS CREATED BY COUNTY during 2014<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th><\/th><th>2014<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>44<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>27<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>436<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>2,312<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>247<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>7,149<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>1,099<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>247<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>637<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>124<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>756<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>494<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>294<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>69<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>44<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>21<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>New Jobs Created<\/td><td>65<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary N Riding<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary S Riding<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>48<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>351<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>285<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>176<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>New Jobs Created <\/td><td>15,012<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400064#WRP02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inni&uacute;lacht sa Ghaeilge sa St&aacute;t Seirbh&iacute;s","counter":671,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400064#WRP02050"},{"type":"question","counter":672,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[1434\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400064#WRP02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"bunaithe ar an treoir a thug an Roinn Caiteachas Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe do gach Roinn, cad &eacute; l&iacute;on agus cad iad gr&aacute;id na bpost d&aacute; mbeidh st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh at&aacute; inni&uacute;il sa Ghaeilge agus sa Bh&eacute;arla ag teast&aacute;il; cad &eacute; l&iacute;on na bpost sin a bhfuil duine leis an gcumas cu&iacute; Gaeilge agus B&eacute;arla iontu cheana f&eacute;in, arna bhriseadh s&iacute;os de r&eacute;ir gr&aacute;id; c&eacute;n ch&aacute;il&iacute;ocht Ghaeilge at&aacute; riachtanach do na poist sin; i gc&aacute;s nach bhfuil an treoir &oacute;n Roinn Caiteachais Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe comhl&iacute;onta, cad &eacute; &uacute;dar na moille agus c&eacute;n uair a dh&eacute;anfar an scr&uacute;d&uacute;; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":673,"content":"<p>Dhearbhaigh suirbh&eacute; ar bhaill foirne, a cuireadh i gcr&iacute;ch in 2012 le heolas a fh&aacute;il faoi leibh&eacute;al an &eacute;ilimh &aacute; bhraistint ag an Roinn ar sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge, gur f&iacute;or&iacute;seal ar fad l&iacute;on na gcumars&aacute;id&iacute; faighte i nGaeilge le blianta beaga anuas.

The use of Own Resource Income has allowed us to maintain the overall level of investment in support of job creation over the past four years, where direct Exchequer allocations have been required to be scaled back, as with all other areas.  The table attached sets out the outturn figures for the period 2011 to 2014 and includes the 2015 allocation recently published in the Revised Estimate.  The sanction sought for ORI for 2015 is in line with previous years.<br\/><br\/>As the Deputy will be aware, the past four years have seen all Departments operating in a challenging fiscal environment.  However, over the period 2011 to 2014, my Department has had funding available to support our job creation objectives of &euro;2.27 Billion in Capital across a range of activities, from the provision of direct supports to client companies of the enterprise agency clients to the provision of an enterprise focussed research and innovation system. <br\/><br\/>The investment by my Department is aligned to and underpins the objectives for recovery and transformation of the enterprise base as set out in the Government's Action Plan for Jobs. The Action Plan for Jobs is a multi-annual strategy initiated in 2012 to ensure a cross-government approach to optimising the environment for enterprise, such that a net additional 100,000 jobs will be created by 2016. <br\/><br\/>I am pleased to report that good progress is being made on the implementation of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.  My Department is currently completing the preparation of the 2015 Action Plan.  Ireland's ranking in terms of competitiveness and ease of doing business continue to improve.  On the jobs front, the CSO Quarterly National Household Survey, as of Q3 2014 indicates that 80,000 additional people are at work compared to Q1 2012 when the Government launched the Action Plan for jobs.  The enterprise agencies of my Department reported record levels of job creation by their client companies again for 2014.  From 2011 to 2014 direct employment in EI supported companies has increased by 16,420 and direct employment in IDA supported companies is up by 22,265 over the period.  These direct jobs have also supported the creation of a similar number of indirect jobs in the wider economy through purchases of materials and services locally. <br\/><br\/>The 2014 Action Plan contains 385 actions to be implemented in 2014 by all 16 Government Departments and by 46 agencies.  Cumulatively to the end of the 3rd Quarter 89% of those scheduled for delivery have been implemented.  These actions cover delivery of supports for enterprise, actions to develop sectoral opportunities and measures that will strengthen the competitiveness and capacity of our economy to support job growth. <br\/><br\/>There are also a series of cross cutting Disruptive Reforms being advanced in 2014.  They include critical areas where we can win an edge across many sectors and include Big Data\/Analytics; ICT Skills; Trading Online; Energy Efficiency; and National Health Innovation Hub. Entrepreneurship; Winning Abroad; and Manufacturing: National Step Change. Each are well advanced in terms of implementation. <br\/><br\/>Some examples of important initiatives implemented in 2014 include:<br\/><br\/>- Launch of Local Enterprise Offices<br\/><br\/>- Launch of &quot;Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur&quot; competition<br\/><br\/>- New staff in overseas office EI and IDA<br\/><br\/>- Record levels of new investment by EI and IDA enterprises<br\/><br\/>- Delivered Smart Futures science, technology and engineering awareness programme<br\/><br\/>The process involved in APJ has proved effective in driving reforms in the past three years.<table><tr><th>&euro;m<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014 (Provisional)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Total* <\/td><td>570.928<\/td><td>586.433<\/td><td>551.161<\/td><td>556.356<\/td><\/tr><\/table>* Includes Total Capital, Capital Carryover plus Own Resource Income Sanctioned, which includes a small amount of current spend. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400065#WRQ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Data","counter":704,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400065#WRQ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":705,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[1631\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400065#WRQ01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide details of all jobs announcements in County Cork over each of the past four years of which his Department has been notified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":706,"content":"<p>My Department and its enterprise agencies Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland make job announcements based on the plans and commitments of the enterprises that they are assisting.

(Official county based data for 2014 will be available shortly).<br\/><br\/>Between 2011 and 2014, Enterprise Ireland approved over &euro;64 million specifically to support development projects undertaken by its 600 plus Cork based client companies.  <br\/><br\/>Indicative figures for the period 2011 to 2014 show that the number of IDA Ireland client companies located in Cork, city and county, increased from 135 in 2011 to 146 in 2014, while the total numbers employed in those companies increased by 3,564, rising from 24,981 in 2011 to 28,545 an increase of 14 %.<br\/><br\/>The following tabular statement sets out details of the employment data for Cork, for Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland respectively.<br\/><br\/>Press releases relating to job creation issued by my Department&rsquo;s Press Office are available at .<br\/><br\/>Details of Enterprise Ireland's job announcements and those of IDA Ireland are also published on their respective websites &ndash; ; .<br\/><br\/>We will forward a list of individual announcements directly to the Deputy.<br\/><br\/><b>Table 1: Enterprise Ireland employment data for Cork from the 'Annual Employment Survey'<\/b><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Number Of Companies<\/td><td>689<\/td><td>690<\/td><td>669<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Full Time Jobs<\/td><td>18,100<\/td><td>19,008<\/td><td>19,775<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Full-time Gains<\/td><td>2,055<\/td><td>1,751<\/td><td>1,741<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Full-time Losses<\/td><td>674<\/td><td>843<\/td><td>974<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Full-time Change<\/td><td>1,381<\/td><td>908<\/td><td>767<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Other Jobs<\/td><td>2,162<\/td><td>2,221<\/td><td>2,437<\/td><\/tr><\/table><b>*<\/b>Employment Data for 2014 is being finalised and will be available shortly.  <br\/><br\/><b>Table 2: IDA Ireland employment data for Cork from the &lsquo;Annual Employment Survey&rsquo;<\/b><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>No of Companies<\/td><td>135<\/td><td>140<\/td><td>147<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Jobs<\/td><td>24,981<\/td><td>26,263<\/td><td>27,399<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>New Jobs Created (gross gains)<\/td><td>2,187<\/td><td>2,395<\/td><td>2,139<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gross Losses<\/td><td>-1,189<\/td><td>-1,113<\/td><td>-1,003<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Net Change<\/td><td>998<\/td><td>1,282<\/td><td>1,136<\/td><\/tr><\/table><b>*<\/b>Employment Data for 2014 is being finalised and will be available shortly.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400065#WRQ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":708,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[1632\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400065#WRQ01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of jobs that have been created by Enterprise Ireland and the Industrial Development Agency supported businesses in each of the past four years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":709,"content":"<p>The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Annual Employment Survey reports on jobs in companies that are supported by the Enterprise Development agencies.

The Action Plan for Jobs is an annual plan designed to drive action across all Government Departments and Agencies in a collective effort to put in place the conditions needed to support and grow employment in the State.<br\/><br\/>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s mission is to support indigenous industry, working with entrepreneurs, Irish businesses, and the research and investment communities to develop Ireland&rsquo;s international trade, innovation and competitiveness.  The ultimate objective is increased employment and prosperity in Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland works with High Potential Start-ups (HPSUs) with a capability to start a business and sell in export markets, Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) in manufacturing and internationally traded services, large companies employing 250 or more, and, Irish-based food and natural resource companies that are overseas owned or controlled.<br\/><br\/>In its &quot;End of Year Statement&quot; published on Monday, January 12, Enterprise Ireland reported that client companies created 19,705 new jobs in 2014.  This resulted in a net increase of 8,476 in the total number of people employed by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, the highest net gain in the history of the Agency.  This increase in employment reinforces Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy of driving innovation, scale and leadership positions in international markets and new sectors. <br\/><br\/>This continuation of employment growth demonstrates clearly the direct impact that increasing exports has on jobs in Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland supported companies now, directly and indirectly, account for more than 300,000 jobs in the Irish economy - 16% of total workforce.  Significantly, Enterprise Ireland clients recorded the lowest level of job losses since 2000.<br\/><br\/>Total direct employment (full and part time) in Enterprise Ireland client companies stood at 180,072 in 2014.  Of these, 156,202 were full-time jobs, while 23,870 were part-time. <br\/><br\/>Total employment at IDA client companies now stands at 174,488, the highest level in the history of IDA Ireland.  The job performance took place against a particularly challenging European economic environment and a changing corporate taxation landscape.  IDA has now exceeded the jobs and investment targets set under its Horizon 2020 Strategy and is currently finalising a new Five Year Strategy to take the organisation into a new phase of development.<br\/><br\/>A dynamic talent pool in Ireland, improved macroeconomic conditions and a concentration on several core sectors were among the contributors to the strong 2014 performance.<br\/><br\/>There were 197 investments in 2014, equating to a 20% increase on 2013.  There was a notable rise in new name investment, with 88 new name investors in 2014, equating to a 13% increase on 2013.  Among the leading investments secured during the year were Amazon, Bristol Myers Squibb, Fidelity, LinkedIn, Survey Monkey, Air Bnb, PayPal, Ericsson, SAP, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, West Pharmaceuticals, Zendesk, Adroll and New Relic.  <br\/><br\/>There were job gains across most sectors IDA is focused on, but particularly in digital media\/content, ICT, international financial services, life sciences and business services.<br\/><br\/><b>Table 1 &ndash; Number of Jobs created by Enterprise Ireland<\/b><br\/><br\/><b>Source:<\/b>Annual Employment Survey Results 2011 - 2014 <table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>New Jobs Created (Gross Gains)<\/td><td>13,719<\/td><td>17,390<\/td><td>18,033<\/td><td>19,705<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/><b>Table 2 &ndash; Number of Jobs created by IDA<\/b><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>New Jobs Created (Gross Gains)<\/td><td>14,432<\/td><td>15,215<\/td><td>15,104<\/td><td>15,012<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400065#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Site Visits","counter":710,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400065#WRQ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":711,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[1645\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400065#WRQ01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will seek assurances from the Industrial Development Agency that attention is being paid to the job creation needs of Tallaght, Dublin 24; if he will ask the IDA to confirm the number of times investment visits were made to Tallaght in 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":712,"content":"<p>Information in relation to IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential investors is provided on a county basis only.

In relation to Spurdog, the EU Total Allowable Catch (TAC) is set at zero and the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) has advised that the stock is depleted.  Spurdog spawning biomass is currently at the lowest observed level, although stable in recent years.  Spurdog is a long-lived, slow growing, and late maturing species and therefore is particularly vulnerable to fishing mortality.  ICES advice is that there should be no target fishery and that by-catch in mixed fisheries should be minimised.  It recommends that by-catches should be managed as part of a rebuilding plan, including close monitoring of the stock and fishery.  The Marine Institute supports ICES advice and further notes that spatial avoidance measures should be put in place as part of a rebuilding plan to avoid large accidental catches.  The Marine Institute advise that, considering the low stock size over the last two decades and the very low productivity of the stock, it is not possible to identify any non zero catch that would be compatible with the Maximum Sustainable Yield approach.  On this basis, the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a zero TAC for 2015 was accepted by the EU Council. <br\/><br\/>In relation to lesser Spotted Dogfish, this stock is not subject to a TAC and quota regime.  It is mainly a bait fishery and was not permitted under technical measures introduced in 2009 to protect the cod and whiting stocks in Area VIa (off the Donegal coast).  Trials by BIM, supported by the Marine Institute on the impact of a fishery targeting lesser spotted dogfish on cod, haddock and whiting was prepared and it allowed Ireland to successfully make the case for an amendment to the EU Regulations to allow for this fishery.

In almost all cases, the advice of the industry representatives are followed in respect of swops. <\/p><p>The monthly whitefish meetings are organised in accordance with a formal written protocol which I put in place in November 2013. This protocol provides that the Committee will comprise representatives from each of the 4 recognised Producer Organisation s (PO s ), the Irish Fish producers and Exporters Association   (IFPEA), the S ea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Department.\u00a0 The meeting is chaired by a Department representative . Each of the Producer Organisations (PO s ) and the IFPEA are represented by a single attendee and in addition each organisation may invite one observer to the meeting. It is practice that the POs have usually one representative of a fisheries co-operative at these meetings as an invitee. Where representatives or observers have business interests related to the fishery \/ quota under discussion, they must advise the meeting of those business interests when giving a view on management issues.\u00a0   <\/p><p>  It is in the interest of the industry as a whole that appropriately recognised organisations represent their interests to deliver a co-ordinated and cohesive view for the benefit of the industry. I consider that this would be very difficult if representation was at the individual level or fragmented amongst a large number of smaller ad hoc representatives groups. In addition, it is important as far as possible for the POs to develop a common position on issues, although this is not always achieved. <\/p><p>  Each year a number of swaps of fishing quotas and effort are arranged by the Department with other Member States. Swaps involve an exchange of fishing opportunities with another Member State and are based on financial value of the exchanges proposed. Swaps are normally initially proposed or organised by the fishing industry led by the Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF) which comprises the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, Irish Fish Producers&rsquo; organisation and the Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Producers Organisation. The Irish South and East Producers Organisation also make proposals and each PO is consulted on swops. <\/p><p>In relation to the swap in 2014 between Ireland and Belgium for plaice in areas VII f,g, this was part of a swap for which Ireland received 125t Monkfish in Area VII. In return Ireland gave Belgium 150t of Plaice in VII f,g and 100t Plaice in Area VIIa. This is a long standing swop that is agreed each year between Belgium and Ireland that provides Ireland with additional monkfish which is a targeted fishery and very important for part of the Irish fleet. This swop was discussed in advance with the POs, at the QMAC meetings on 7 January and 21 February 2014. The FIF fully supported the swop, while the IS&amp;amp;EFO expressed concerns. Taking into account the views expressed, the Department completed the swop. It is expected that a proposal for a similar swop will be under consideration again this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400066#WRR01800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":764,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[49677\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400066#WRR01900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide details of the plaice quota received for areas VII f-g and the quota swapped with Belgium for the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":765,"content":"<p>The details requested by the Deputy are set as follows.

Both my Department and I are very strongly committed to promoting Farm Safety in collaboration with the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), the organisation with primary responsibility for securing health and safety at work.  Farm safety is one of the most critical issues facing farming today.  Statistics show that accidents on farms cause more workplace deaths than all other occupations combined.  There were 30 people killed in farm accidents in 2014, which is the greatest number of fatal accidents since 1992.  This was over half of all the workplace deaths in Ireland, making farming the most dangerous occupation in the country.  It is also clear that the most vulnerable people to have accidents and injury in the farming sector are the old and the young, with 5 people under 18 having died in farm accidents and a further 10 who were over 65.<\/p><p>  My Department has taken a number of steps over the last 12 months and over recent years in tandem with some of the other State and industry organisations to raise awareness of the problem and educate farmers and their families on the dangers of working in this industry.<\/p><p>  Most recently, I launched a new Farm Safety Scheme for the grant-aiding of items relating to farm safety.  I have committed funding of &euro;12.2 million to the scheme which covers items such as animal handling facilities, safety agitation points for slurry tanks and safety cages under translucent roof sheets, to name but a few of the items being supported.  This scheme will see a significant investment in farm safety on farms in the coming months.<\/p><p>  Research has shown that there is a high level of awareness amongst farmers of health and safety issues and that a focus should now be placed on changing behaviours.<\/p><p>  My focus at present is to encourage changes in farmers&rsquo; behaviour through positive supports and further education.

Once approval is granted, my Department will move to complete the scheme Terms and Conditions for GLAS and will open the Scheme for applications.  I anticipate that between 25,000 and 30,000 farmers will be approved for entry to GLAS this year and, as the regulations require that all applications be administratively checked before any application is approved, it will take some time to process applications.  This work will be prioritised with a view to having it completed as quickly as possible.  As with the introduction of previous agri-environmental schemes, payment in the first year of application (2015) will be on a part-year basis, followed by annual payments for a further five full calendar years.  I have included a sum of &euro;20m in my Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2015 to cover expenditure on GLAS this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400067#WRS03500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":842,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400067#WRS03550"},{"type":"question","counter":843,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[1336\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400067#WRS03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when an AEOS payment will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":844,"content":"<p>The person named was approved for participation in the 2011 Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS 2) with effect from 1<sup>st<\/sup>September 2011 and payments have issued in respect of the 2011, 2012 and 2013 Scheme years.

To this end, my Department recognises the important role that the land use sector plays in mitigating greenhouse gases and is strongly committed to providing funding for targeted research in the area of carbon sequestration. Since 2010, my Department has provided more than &euro;4.9 million towards on-going research into the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural and forest lands. A list of these projects, and completed projects, is provided in Appendix.The beneficiaries of research awards &ndash; including Teagasc and Irish Third Level institutions &ndash; are examining the effects of differing agricultural and silvicultural practices on soil organic carbon stocks. In addition, other projects are examining the effects of land use change and tillage management on carbon sink activity.<br\/><br\/>One of the larger projects my Department has funded is &lsquo;Gaseous Emissions and Land Use Network &ndash; GHG Ireland&rsquo;. This network aims to bring together, in a four year initiative, all principal investigators working in the field of agricultural climate change research. The main focus of the network is to improve our understanding of carbon stock changes in agricultural soils so that we can contribute to the development of a more robust inventory, and underpin future accounting for these categories. My Department has also funded a project on the management of soil organic carbon in Irish agricultural systems.<br\/><br\/>In addition, my Department has funded a number of research projects under the CARBiFOR (Carbon Sequestration in Irish Forest Ecosystems) programme in order to improve the estimation and reporting of carbon sequestration in forests in Ireland, including farm forests. Currently this work is being funded by the Department under the CForRep project, which is coordinated by\u00a0University College Dublin and also involves The University of Limerick and University College Cork.

A number of Irish beef processing establishments which had applied for approval to export to the US were audited. The final report of the audit visit was received at the end of December 2014 and is available on the website of the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS). FSIS has confirmed that: &ldquo; Ireland has consistently and effectively implemented a beef slaughter inspection system that satisfies all criteria for equivalence with the FSIS meat inspection system&rdquo;. This equivalence recognition has led to the re-opening of the US market to exports of beef from Ireland. However, before trade can commence a number of technical details remain to be concluded e.g. formally listing plants eligible to export, agreeing a veterinary health certificate covering both animal and public health, the eligibility of certain cuts including trimmings and the level of testing required for some intact cuts.<\/p><p>  As regards the testing required, it will be the responsibility of the Food Business Operator (FBO) to have the required tests carried out at an approved laboratory of their own choice. I am informed some Irish based private laboratories are in a position to provide such a service to processors. In addition, verification samples will be taken by my officials and will be tested in the Department&rsquo;s laboratory complex in Backweston.<\/p><p>  In accordance with normal practice, the certification of consignments to the US will be the responsibility of the official veterinarian in charge of the listed establishment.<\/p><p>  The total US beef market is estimated at 11 million metric tonnes. It is split 60: 40 between foodservice and grocery retail (by volume). Approximately 10% (by volume) is imported, the bulk of which is manufacturing beef. Demand for Irish beef there is expected to be immediate and exceptionally strong. I know that some of the leading Irish beef exporters have had people on the ground in the US for some time now in preparation for this announcement and the y are reporting huge opportunities for Irish companies when the trade does commence. Bord Bia has identified the primary target for US market entry as white tablecloth restaurants in key culinary centres such as New York City, Boston and Washington DC, followed by listings in premium grocery retailers initially in the North Eastern states. With record beef prices currently prevailing in the US, opportunities for Irish manufacturing beef are also being explored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400068#WRT03100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pigmeat Sector","counter":892,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400069#WRU00150"},{"type":"question","counter":893,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[1573\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400069#WRU00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to address a matter (details supplied) regarding pig meat producers here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":894,"qnumday":344,"qnumall":"[1776\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400069#WRU00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the proposals he has put to the European Commission regarding the urgent need to provide assistance for the pigmeat sector due to the serious drop in prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":895,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[1777\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400069#WRU00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the market support measures that he has requested the European Commission to introduce to support the pigmeat sector in view of current difficulties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":896,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 335, 344 and 345 together.<\/p><p>  The development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for me given the crucial role which the industry plays in supporting approximately 7,000 jobs including production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services. In 2014 export volumes increased by approximately 7%, with growth to the UK, Continental Europe and International markets. Values increased by some 3% and are in the range of &euro;570 million, continuing the growth seen in recent years. Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices and production followed by recovery and this has remained the case for many years. <\/p><p>  My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally. I also met with members of the IFA National Pigs and Pigmeat Committee recently to hear their views on developments.<\/p><p>  I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure in recent months and the difficulties that this is causing for producers. Having said that, it must be noted that Irish prices remain above the EU average at present. However I would also add that like any other EU Minister I do not have a role in the setting of prices. This is a function of the market.<\/p><p>  In relation to the Russian ban on EU pigmeat exports, I am fully aware of the concerns Irish pig farmers have as a result of the closure of this market. At EU level the Commission has referred this matter to the WTO for resolution. At recent Council meetings I have joined with other Ministers in requesting the European Commission to continue to monitor the developments on markets and called for the introduction of private storage aid. This request did not, however, have the support of a qualified majority of Member States. Nevertheless, the Commission acknowledged the significant decline in pig prices and will keep the situation under review. I am committed, however, to continuing to work with liked minded Ministers.   <\/p><p>  Support is provided by my Department for the pig sector in a number of ways. Firstly I have included provision in 2015 and throughout the whole RDP for an on-farm capital investments scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors, with &euro;37 million allocated for 2015. Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers. Other elements of the RDP, such as targeted on farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the pig sector. <\/p><p>  Other supports for the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility and courses in pig production, plays an important role in improving production at farm level. Through its Joint Research Advisory Programme, Teagasc will support Irish pig producers by providing advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector. The programme has enabled Teagasc to employ four additional advisors and researchers to support producers and the sector through advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector. The high level objective of the programme is to enhance the sustainability of Irish pig meat production, including improvements in economic, social and environmental standards. This will result in improvements in the production and marketability of Irish pig meat.<\/p><p>  I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pig meat in domestic and overseas markets. Bord Bia provides assistance to the pig meat sector through its marketing and promotional activities, and the pig meat quality assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pig meat on the domestic market and helps expand its presence on EU and third country markets. Indeed from now until 1 February Bord Bia are running a detailed targeted Pork promotional campaign to assist the industry. Further campaigns are planned over the coming months to promote ham and bacon.<\/p><p>  For my part I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish Pigmeat processors. Indeed it is a key element of my strategy to seek new market opportunities. In that regard I was pleased to announce in recent months the opening of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which will serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400069#WRU00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licence Applications","counter":897,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400069#WRU00550"},{"type":"question","counter":898,"qnumday":336,"qnumall":"[1616\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400069#WRU00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 477 and 478 of 2 October 2012, if he will review and expedite the approval of an aquaculture and foreshore licence application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":899,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[1617\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400069#WRU00650","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 477 and 478 of 2 October 2012, if he will review and expedite the approval of aquaculture and foreshore licence application in respect of persons (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":900,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[1618\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400069#WRU00675","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will review and expedite the approval of aquaculture and foreshore licence application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":901,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 336 to 338, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  The applications for aquaculture licences referred to by the Deputy are in respect of sites located in Castlemaine Harbour, which is designated as a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive and a Special Protection Area under the EU Birds Directive (Natura 2000 site).   <\/p><p>  All applications in &lsquo;Natura&rsquo; areas are required to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of environmental compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.

Notwithstanding this, the importance of this market in terms of its future potential cannot be understated. The obvious preference is for a normalisation of trade relations but these issues cannot be viewed without taking into account the overall political context. Consequently, I and officials in my Department have been engaged in ongoing efforts to rectify the situation.    In October of last year, I met the Russian Ambassador with a view to working bilaterally to resolve some of the technical issues that have disrupted exports of certain agrifood products from Ireland to Russia. Specifically, we discussed ways in which restrictions imposed as a result of audits or animal disease outbreaks in other parts of the EU could be eased. <\/p><p>  As a follow up to this meeting, the Irish Ambassador to Russia, accompanied by senior officials from my Department met with their Russian counterparts in Moscow in December of last year. During this meeting it was agreed that bilateral meetings should continue with one being held yesterday. <\/p><p>  It is clear that certain sectors of the agrifood industry are disproportionately impacted by the current trade restrictions. For the Irish pigmeat industry Russia was the second largest export destination prior to the ban. My officials have impressed upon the Russians the importance of this market to the pig sector in Ireland.<\/p><p>  At EU level the Commission has referred this matter to the WTO for resolution. At recent Council meetings I have joined with other Ministers in requesting the European Commission to continue to monitor the developments on markets called for the introduction of private storage aid. This request did not, however, have the support of a qualified majority of Member States. Nevertheless, the Commission acknowledged the significant decline in pig prices and will keep the situation under review. I am committed, however, to continue to working with liked minded Ministers.<\/p><p>  For my part I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish Pigmeat processors. Indeed it is a key element of my strategy to seek new market opportunities. And in that regard I was pleased to announce in recent months the opening of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which will serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports.<\/p><p>  My Department will maintain an ongoing assessment of the situation,   and continue to engage at EU level and with the Russian authorities regarding this and all other agri-trade matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400069#WRU02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Noxious Weeds","counter":921,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400069#WRU02350"},{"type":"question","counter":922,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[1784\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400069#WRU02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to add Japanese knotweed to the noxious weed list; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1053","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":923,"content":"<p>Japanese knotweed ( <i>Fallopia japonica<\/i>) is an invasive herbaceous perennial which has the potential to seriously damage buildings and hard surfaces by growing through concrete, tarmac and other hard surfaces while also threatening native plants and animals by forming dense thickets.Regulation 49 of SI 477 of 2011 European Communities (Birds And Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 makes it an offence for any person who plants, disperses, allows or causes to disperse, spreads or otherwise causes to grow in any place such invasive species as Japanese knotweed. <br\/><br\/>The Noxious Weeds Act 1936 provides that it is an offence not to prevent the growth and spread of noxious weeds such as Ragwort, Thistle, Dock, Common Barberry, Male Wild Hop and Spring Wild Oat which are currently scheduled under the Act.

Resulting from the revised strength ceiling, a major re-organisation of the Permanent Defence Force was initiated. Key aspects of the reorganisation included the consolidation of three under-strength Army Brigades into two full strength Brigades, the consolidation of under-strength units into a smaller number of full strength units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and the associated re-deployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational units. <br\/><br\/>A major re-organisation of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve was implemented in 2013 and the Reserve Defence Force is now organised alongside the Permanent Defence Force, within a more efficient single force structure.<br\/><br\/>All of these measures have ensured that the Permanent Defence Force continues to deliver required operational outputs for all approved Aid to the Civil Power and approved Aid to the Civil Authority requests.

Consequently there is no necessity for a public consultation process.<br\/><br\/>The need to commence Part 3 of the 2008 Act arises from the changes brought about to the structure of the EU as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon.  In accordance with that Treaty, instruments providing for co-operation in police and criminal justice matters have to be implemented within 5 years of the Treaty coming into effect, that is by 1 December 2014.  Furthermore, these measures, including the EU Convention, have been brought within the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice from 1 December 2014.  In order to accede to the Convention, all parts of the 2008 Act had to be brought into force.  Therefore, had Ireland not commenced Part 3 by 1 December, it risked infringement proceedings and potential fines.<br\/><br\/>The 2008 Act gives effect to the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.  It applies only to mutual assistance in relation to criminal matters and is the basis for Ireland's mutual legal assistance arrangements with other EU member states.  <br\/><br\/>Part 3 of the Act deals with mutual assistance cooperation in relation to criminal investigations and prosecutions where the lawful interception of communications is considered necessary and appropriate. It does not provide for any form of mass surveillance or data gathering.  What it means in practice is where a lawful interception order is in place in one EU state for the investigation of serious crime, a request can be made in another state for assistance in facilitating interception. However, giving effect to that request may only be done if it is  in accordance with the domestic law of the State.  The provisions of the 2008 Act are also reciprocal so the Garda&iacute; can request this type of assistance from other EU member states. Given the sometimes international nature of serious crime, this will further enhance the capabilities of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na to deal with it.<br\/><br\/>In Ireland the domestic law is the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993.  Again, this Act does not permit or facilitate any form of mass surveillance. Under the Act, interception of communications can only occur following the satisfying of specific conditions. One of these is that an investigation must be underway into a serious criminal offence before an interception warrant can be granted by the Minister for Justice and Equality.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore the Act<i><\/i>is overseen by a designated Judge of the High Court and also provides for a Complaints Referee to whom anyone who feels they have been the victim of an abuse of the legislation may refer their case.<br\/><br\/>Finally, there has been media comment about the provision in Part 3 of the 2008 Act for <i>in <\/i>camera Court hearings for a failure by a company to comply with directions issued by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources under the 1983 Postal and Telecommunications Services Act. I wish to be quite clear. The provision arises because, obviously, it would not be appropriate in <i>open<\/i>Court to disclose sensitive information concerning authorisations for interception in the investigation of a serious crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400072#WRX01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Services Regulation","counter":1060,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400072#WRX01050"},{"type":"question","counter":1061,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[49467\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400072#WRX01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"regarding the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, and in view of the context of a new Bill on lobbying reform, Registration of Lobbying Bill 2014, if she and her Department officials will make a public interest disclosure of lobbying efforts made during the three years since the Bill was published; if her attention has been drawn to a message (details supplied) published in January-February 2012; and if her Bill will go any way towards restoring public trust in the legal system.

It commenced D&aacute;il Report Stage on 11th July 2014 which is to resume in the coming weeks. It is my intention that the Bill be enacted so that the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority come into operation during the first half of 2015.<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b>It is regrettable that the item to which the Deputy refers dates from an early 2012 edition of the Solicitors Gazette and is an initial iteration of the Law Society, as but one stake-holder, in response to the Bill's publication. The document is three years out of date at this stage and consequently does not reflect the subsequent development and enhancement of the Bill before the House. As the Deputy has confirmed in forming her Question, such views, like those of many other stake-holders in the Bill, are already in the public domain. They have also  been the subject of firm responses in support of Government policy by myself and my predecessor which are also a matter of public record - indeed my Department held a public conference in support of the Bill's reforms in July 2012. The Deputy will also have witnessed a number of these responses first hand in the debate of the Bill during D&aacute;il Report and Committee Stages and at the opening session of D&aacute;il Report Stage. By the same token, she will be aware of the various enhancements that have been made to the Bill in the course of those proceedings. Moreover, having been a key deliverable under the EU\/IMF\/ECB Troika Programme, the Bill and its structural reforms are now the subject of a Country Specific Recommendation under the EU Semester Process.<br\/><br\/>The Bill has an array of measures which continue to support both the public interest and public confidence. It continues to provide for a new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority with a lay majority and a lay Chair. The Authority will have responsibility for the oversight of both solicitors and barristers and will be independent in its functions and in its appointment by nominating bodies. There will now be an independent complaints framework to deal with public complaints directly instead of through the professional bodies as happens at present. There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal to deal with both legal professions. There will be a new, transparent and much more consumer-focussed legal costs regime augmented by an enhanced legal costs determination procedure under the aegis of a new Legal Costs Adjudicator whose findings will be publicly accessible. Moreover, the Bill continues to make provision for alternative business models for the provision of legal services, including in tandem with non-legal service providers, by way of increasing competition and choice in the legal services market and I will be bringing forward further amendments to these new business provisions for the resumption of D&aacute;il Report Stage.<br\/><br\/>It is clear from these developments and from the Regulatory Impact Analysis published by my Department that the Bill is not, as the Deputy would seem to insinuate, the property of any single stake-holder. Rather, it represents a more modern balancing of the interests of consumers of legal services with those which would have traditionally applied from a narrower professional perspective.  Among the more directly interested parties are the Law Society, the Bar Council, the Dublin Solicitors' Bar Association and the Honorable Society of King's Inns. I  continue to receive submissions from these as I do from other stake-holders who similarly have specific observations to make on the detail of the Bill. Over the past three years, my predecessor and I, and  departmental officials, have had various meetings with  interested groups and bodies. Alongside the legal professional bodies, these have included the Competition Authority, the Consumers' Association and the Committee of Heads of Irish University Law Schools all of whose views have been publicly iterated and are readily accessible on the internet. Over ninety written submissions have been received since the publication of the Bill, representing over thirty-six interested parties, along with dozens of individual letters from concerned members of the public as well as the formal observations of other Government Departments who support the Bill's structural reforms. <br\/><br\/>Submissions have, therefore, come from a wide range of bodies beyond those representing the legal professions including academics, civil liberty and human rights organisations, private businesses and the affected clients of legal practitioners. I continue to encourage, receive and consider such submissions and views on the Bill and I look forward to the Deputy's ongoing contribution in this regard.  I also look forward to the coming enactment of the Registration of Lobbying Bill 2014 which, having just  completed D&aacute;il Committee Stage under the stewardship of my Cabinet colleague, Minister Brendan Howlin, is commencing D&aacute;il Report Stage this week.  These lobbying measures will  be a further and welcome embellishment of the parliamentary process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400072#WRX01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residential Institutions","counter":1063,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400072#WRX01225"},{"type":"question","counter":1064,"qnumday":400,"qnumall":"[49574\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400072#WRX01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Bill 2014 provides for health services to be made available without charge to women in their current country of residence, or if the provision is only applicable to health services delivered here.

I would also like to thank the Inspector of Prisons, Judge Michael Reilly, for his very comprehensive investigation and report into the death in custody of the prisoner concerned.  <\/p><p>  Since 1 January, 2012, the death of any prisoner in custody or on temporary release is the subject of an independent investigation by the Inspector of Prisons.  The Office of the Inspector is a statutory independent office established under the Prisons Act, 2007.  <\/p><p>  The Inspector's investigation and reports are part of a three pronged process, the other elements being investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and investigations and inquests conducted by Coroners.\u00a0 The combination of the Garda inquiries, the Coroners&rsquo; investigations and inquests, and the Inspector&rsquo;s reports mean that this country is in compliance with its national and international obligations and meets the criteria laid down by the European Court of Human Rights when interpreting the procedural requirements of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\u00a0<\/p><p>  It is important for all concerned, where any issues or deficiencies arise, that we ensure they are addressed and that we learn from them.

Proposals are under consideration for a more structured approach of limited temporary release in such cases, where full and constructive engagement with the prison and probation services could lessen the risk of re-offending.<\/p><p>  In this consideration, the safety of the public, the importance of victims, and the goal of reducing re-offending will be the primary objectives.<\/p><p>  In relation to the issue of Garda submissions on applications for temporary release, it is important, given the crucial role that Garda advice can have in the consideration of such applications, that this issue is addressed generally, and not simply in relation to any individual case.

One of the key requirements of the UN Convention is that persons with capacity difficulties should be enabled to exercise decision-making autonomy.  Consequently, the starting point in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill is one of enabling persons with capacity difficulties to take their own decisions to the greatest extent possible.  Where they are unable to take decisions themselves, the Bill provides for a series of decision-making supports.  However, the priority remains one of ensuring that the person's will and preferences are respected as far as possible.<\/p><p>  I recognise the fundamental and critical role of parents, and other relatives and siblings in relation to the day-to-day lives of many people who need assistance in exercising their legal capacity. The focus of the Bill is on enabling persons to make their own decisions, including choosing whom they wish to support them in the decision-making process. However, w  here persons with capacity difficulties are unable to take decisions themselves, it is likely that, in many cases, family members will be centrally involved in the decision-making support options available under the Bill.   Under the co-decision-making option in particular, where decisions are made jointly by the person with capacity difficulties and by the co-decision-maker, it is anticipated that the co-decision-maker will often be a family member as it is a requirement of this support option that the co-decision-maker should know the person and understand his or her will and preferences.  It will also be possible for a family member to apply to the court to be appointed as a decision-making representative for a person with capacity difficulties where that person lacks decision-making capacity. <\/p><p>  The Bill, when enacted, is intended to be of direct assistance in setting out guiding principles and levels of intervention which should be of considerable help to persons and their supportive families. In addition, the Office of the Public Guardian which will be set up under the Bill, will be able to provide advice and support to persons with capacity difficulties and families who help them.<\/p><p>  I intend to propose a range of amendments to the Bill at its forthcoming Committee Stage to strengthen the safeguards in the Bill aimed at respecting the person's autonomy, dignity and bodily integrity.

Responsibility for the administration of the Scheme was transferred to the Legal Aid Board on 1 June 2012. <br\/><br\/><i>Criminal Assets Bureau Legal Aid Scheme<\/i><br\/><br\/>The Scheme is applicable to persons who are respondents and\/or defendants in any court proceedings brought by, or in the name of, the Criminal Assets Bureau including court proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, the Revenue Acts or the Social Welfare Acts and applications made by the Director of Public Prosecutions under Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.

A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common. There are very positive signs which include the initiative set up in 2011 operating from the District Court in Dolphin House involving a co-location of the Courts with a family mediation service and a law centre. This has proved very successful and was put on a permanent footing in 2014. Similar initiatives are now operating from Cork, Naas, Limerick, Clonmel and Nenagh. Integration of the Family Mediation Service into the Legal Aid Board has also meant an increase in the referrals from Law Centres to mediation in appropriate cases.<br\/><br\/><b>Merger of the Property Registration Authority, Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland<\/b><br\/><br\/>The merger of the Property Registration Authority, Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland has been mandated by the Government under the Agency Rationalisation Programme.

The general position, however, is that conditions applicable to the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor are set out in the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2011. Under section 17(3) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, it is already an offence for a licensee, with intent to evade the conditions of the licence, to take intoxicating liquor from the licensed premises for the purpose of its being sold on the account or for the benefit or profit of the licensee, or to permit any other person, including taxi drivers or other individuals, to do so. <\/p><p>  The Government Alcohol Advisory Group considered specific issues relating to 'distance sales' of intoxicating liquor in its 2008 Report. The Group drew attention to the requirement that payment must be made as part of the transaction in such cases, e.g. on-line shopping, and not later on delivery of the product. The Group noted that sales of intoxicating liquor which had been ordered by telephone or otherwise and which were paid for on delivery were illegal transactions and recommended that the Garda&iacute; should target such delivery services with a view to prosecuting the offending licensees. Any information concerning transactions of this nature which are contrary to the provisions of the Licensing Acts should, therefore, be brought to the attention of the Garda&iacute; for investigation and possible prosecution. <\/p><p>  Moreover, under section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (as amended), it is an offence for a licensee to sell or deliver, or to permit any other person to sell or deliver, alcohol to any person for consumption off his or her premises by a person under the age of 18 years in any place except with the explicit consent of the person's parent or guardian in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400073#WRY03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Staff","counter":1147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400074#WRZ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1148,"qnumday":428,"qnumall":"[1169\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400074#WRZ00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide a breakdown on the number of civil servants employed by the Courts Service in County Tipperary for 2011, 2012 and 2013, and currently by full time or part time basis, grade and location.","asker":"962","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1149,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions.<br\/><br\/>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had inquiries made and the information sought by the Deputy is set out in the table below:<table><tr><th>Grade<\/th><th>Location<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>Current Staffing<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal<\/td><td>Clonmel<\/td><td>2 full time<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Higher Executive Officer<\/td><td>Clonmel<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Executive Officer<\/td><td>Clonmel<\/td><td>1 full time<br \/><br \/>1 part time<\/td><td>3 full time<\/td><td>3 full time<\/td><td>3 full time<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clerical Officer<\/td><td>Clonmel<\/td><td>6 full time<br \/><br \/>3 part time<\/td><td>5 full time<br \/><br \/>3 part time<\/td><td>5 full time<br \/><br \/>2 part time<\/td><td>5 full time<br \/><br \/>2 part time<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Court Messenger<\/td><td>Clonmel<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><td>1  full time<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal<\/td><td>Nenagh<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Higher Executive Officer<\/td><td>Nenagh<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Executive Officer<\/td><td>Nenagh<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><td>1 full time<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clerical Officer<\/td><td>Nenagh<\/td><td>1 full time<br \/><br \/>1 part time<\/td><td>1 full time<br \/><br \/>1 part time<\/td><td>1 full time<br \/><br \/>1 part time<\/td><td>1 full time<br \/><br \/>1 part-time<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td><\/td><td>20<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><\/table><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Note: Clonmel changed from being a District Court Office and a Circuit Court Office to being a combined office on 19\/11\/2012.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400074#WRZ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":1150,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400074#WRZ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1151,"qnumday":429,"qnumall":"[1180\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400074#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to propose a referendum to deal with legacy upward only rental agreements;

A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.

The Irish Prison Service (IPS) concluded that an insufficient amount of prisoner recreation space was provided for in the Cork prison plans as originally tendered.  It was agreed that separate Recreation Halls \/Areas on each landing were not adequate for the recreational needs of the proposed prisoner population in the new prison in Cork.  <br\/><br\/>Accordingly, the IPS reviewed the plans for the proposed new Cork Prison in relation to the indoor recreation \/amenity space provided for in the exemplar design which had been issued for tender purposes.  An information notice was issued in September 2013 informing all of the shortlisted tenderers of an emerging requirement for the construction of a recreation block during the course of the project.  The bidders were advised that the recreation block would be called up by way of a change order with the cost being determined in accordance with their submitted rates.  <br\/><br\/>The contract was awarded in December 2013.  The design of the recreation block was developed over a period of several weeks and a final design proposal was recommended to the IPS Capital Projects Oversight Board (CPOB) by the IPS Project Team.  The recommendation of the Project Team, and costs for the construction of the block were approved by the CPOB in March 2014.  As the block was not included in the tender scope of works it has been incorporated into the works by way of a change order.  The cost of the recreation block is &euro;1.63m exclusive of VAT.<br\/><br\/>No additional planning consent was required as the design of the additional recreation block has been developed to ensure it sits in the approved design with no material impact.  <br\/><br\/>The successful bidder has fully incorporated the recreation block into their programme and consequently no delay in the completion of the project should occur due to the inclusion of this requirement.  The anticipated duration of the programme is 20 months and the target date for practical completion is July 2015.  <b><font color=\"#000080\"><\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400075#WRAA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1186,"qnumday":441,"qnumall":"[1295\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400075#WRAA01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the tender cost and the name of the successful firm which won the consultancy tender to manage the redevelopment of Limerick Prison and the new Cork Prison.

The events in Paris last week are a stark illustration of the reality of this situation.<\/p><p>  However it is important that any response Ireland might make in a national context is proportionate. <\/p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na monitors the movements of those suspected of involvement in extremist behaviour. The number of Irish citizens who are believed to have travelled to the conflict zones since the commencement of the Arab Spring is estimated at between 25 and 30. However, within that number are individuals who would have travelled to Libya and other Arab States to take part in the popular uprisings there which began in December 2010.  Others travelled for humanitarian or family reasons.  Nonetheless some are also known to have participated in the various conflicts and at least three have lost their lives. <\/p><p>  There are also a number of individuals who have returned from the conflict zones and a small number of people based here who support extremism and would try to facilitate it.  The activities of these people are closely monitored by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and there is very close cooperation with security services in other jurisdictions. \u00a0It would be counterproductive to go into what specific intelligence is available.<\/p><p>  In line with best practice internationally An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has engaged with returnees from the conflict areas.  The Garda&iacute; also operate a progressive community relations programme through its Racial Inter-Cultural and Diversity Office. That office is in regular contact with our minority communities and recently received favourable comment on its operation from the UN Counter Terrorism Committee. <\/p><p>  It is also vital that the State has the necessary legislation in place to address the terrorist threat. In that context  I wish to advise the Deputy that the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014 has already passed all stages in the Seanad.   The Bill, when enacted, will create the three new offences of, public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism. These offences will carry sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment on conviction on indictment and are particularly pertinent to the nature of the threat posed by radicalised individuals and indeed those who incite them to commit such heinous acts as those witnessed last week. It is expected that the Bill will go before the D&aacute;il next month and that it will be passed shortly thereafter. <\/p><p>  In an international context, Ireland has been active on this issue for some time now. Indeed priority was given to the matter during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013. In that connection Ireland was successful in gaining the agreement of the Member States to carry out a review of the EU Strategy for Countering Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism.  A primary point of focus in this review is the foreign fighter issue. A number of initiatives at EU level have since been developed for member States to combat this phenomenon including community relations initiatives, media campaigns,  enhanced tracking of suspects' movements, engagement with third countries (notably Turkey) and engagement with internet service providers and social media companies to curb radical online content.  <\/p><p>Within the EU framework the Government has consistently supported the availability of airline Passenger Name Records (PNR) data to law enforcement services, subject to the appropriate safeguards. The proposed EU Directive on PNR is an important measure in the ongoing fight against terrorism and serious crime. While agreeing a PNR Directive has proved a very contentious policy area from the European Parliament&rsquo;s point of view, this Government's strong preference is for an agreed EU framework for PNR and we will continue to work with our colleagues in other EU Member States to reach an agreement on this matter. The sole and shared aim of this Directive is, after all,  to ensure the safety of our citizens  .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400076#WRBB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts Data","counter":1268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400076#WRBB04050"},{"type":"question","counter":1269,"qnumday":469,"qnumall":"[1671\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400076#WRBB04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide details of all consultancy firms engaged by her Department during 2014; if she will also provide details of all the relevant fees paid to those firms during the period; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1270,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the table below:<table><tr><th>Company\/Consultancy Firm<\/th><th>Purpose<\/th><th>Amount Paid - 2014 <br \/><br \/>(&euro;)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Rits Bianconi Research Ltd<\/td><td>Information Security Consultancy<\/td><td>38,712<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>University of Limerick<\/td><td>Analysis of text for final Review of National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2010-2014<\/td><td>5,786<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ms. Maureen Lynott<\/td><td>Facilitation of and reporting on a Consultative Forum for the National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence on 17 November, 2014<\/td><td>4,900<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Professor Tim Trimble<\/td><td>Research project commissioned jointly by the Probation Service and the Probation Board of Northern Ireland<\/td><td>6,204<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Rits<\/td><td>Expert advice relating to the security of information systems in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission<\/td><td>5,623<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dr. John Pearse (two separate payments)<\/td><td>To assist with the work of the Smyth Advisory Committee which was set up to advise the Department on any changes in the law or practice in relation to interviewing suspects held in Garda custody.<\/td><td>104<br \/><br \/>and<br \/><br \/>Sterling &pound;6,922<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400076#WRBB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Data","counter":1271,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400076#WRBB04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1272,"qnumday":470,"qnumall":"[1681\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400076#WRBB04500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason certain crime statistics, in particular rates of theft and burglary, are higher in the commuter belt counties of Kildare and Meath; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that Garda resources per capita in these counties are the worst in the country; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1273,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the publication of recorded crime statistics rests with the Central Statistics Office as the national statistics agency.

It is true that Garda strength has been affected by retirements, and that is why I was pleased to be able to secure approval for the resumption of Garda recruitment.  As the Deputy will be aware, 100 new recruits entered training at the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014, the first intake of Garda recruits since 2009 . This was followed by an intake of a further 100 new recruits in December.  A further intake of 100 is due to enter training at the end of this month.  This will bring to 300 the number of recruits in the Garda College since last September and is a measure of this Government's commitment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The first intake of recruits will attest as members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in May of this year and will be assigned to Garda Stations by the Garda Commissioner. <\/p><p>  It is of course a key objective of the Garda Commissioner to allocate all of the resources at her disposal in a manner which maximises their impact on the protection of the public and on the prevention and detection of crime.  In that context, Garda management keep under continuing review developments in relation to security assessments, crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources.<\/p><p>  I have however been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of Kildare and Meath Garda Divisions on 30 November 2014, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 301 and 281 respectively. There are also 41 Reserves and 28 Civilians attached to Kildare Garda Division and 43 Reserves and 26 Civilians attached to the Meath Garda Division.<\/p><p>  With the recommencement of Garda Recruitment, the allocation of Garda&iacute; from the Garda College on completion of training to the Kildare and Meath Garda Divisions will be kept under review and fully considered by the Garda Commissioner within overall requirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400076#WRBB04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commissions of Investigation","counter":1274,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400076#WRBB04650"},{"type":"question","counter":1275,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[1708\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400076#WRBB04800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on extending the terms of reference to the commission of investigation lead by Sean Guerin to include an investigation into the death of a person (details supplied) in County Dublin; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1197","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1276,"content":"<p>The Deputy is referring to the Commission of Investigation being established on foot of the recommendations of Mr Se&aacute;n Guerin, SC, in his report of 6 May 2014 on how allegations made by Sergeant Maurice McCabe concerning certain cases connected to the Cavan\/Monaghan Garda Division were handled.  I published the draft Order proposing the establishment of this Commission of Investigation on 19 December 2014.  The draft Order includes the terms of reference for the Commission.  All of the matters recommended by Mr Guerin SC for inclusion in a Commission of Investigation are included in the terms of reference. <br\/><br\/>The case referred to by the Deputy is amongst the complaints being considered under the mechanism established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which have been made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, or the Taoiseach,  with a view to determining to what extent and in what manner further action may be required in each case.  A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.  The review of each complaint will consist of an examination of the papers in the complaint by a counsel from the panel.  Following the review of each complaint a recommendation will be made as to whether any further action is desirable and could practicably be taken.  <br\/><br\/>Where counsel do recommend further investigations, I will be very strongly guided by that advice.  Clearly, there are a number of possible options for further investigations, in particular by way of referral to GSOC, but any recommendation for referral of a case to a commission of investigation will be very carefully considered, including whether this could be achieved by way of amending the terms of reference of an existing commission or the establishment of a separate commission.  <b><font color=\"#000080\"><\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400076#WRBB04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport Expenditure","counter":1277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400076#WRBB04950"},{"type":"question","counter":1278,"qnumday":472,"qnumall":"[1729\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400076#WRBB05100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the amount spent on maintenance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na vehicle fleet in the years 2012, 2013 and 2014.","asker":"1190","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1279,"content":"<p>The Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote.<br\/><br\/>In that context, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the maintenance costs for the Garda fleet for the period 2012 - 2014, including spare parts, tyres and towing, are set out in the table below: <table><tr><th>2012 <\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;<\/td><td>&euro;<\/td><td>&euro;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10,703,431<\/td><td>12,752,325<\/td><td>11,131,267<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>The Deputy will be aware that I recently secured a further &euro;10 million for investment in the Garda fleet of which &euro;7 million was made available in 2014.

Applicants for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable then to pay for legal representation.  The Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.The nature of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme is that it is demand led, driven by the incidence of crime, detection rates and the prosecution of cases through the courts system. <br\/><br\/>In seeking to reduce the expenditure on the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, the rates of fees paid to the legal practitioners were reduced by 8% in March 2009 and by a further 8% in April, 2010. There was also a reduction of 10% in July 2011 in the fees payable in the District Court. Fees payable in the Circuit and higher courts were also decreased by 10% in October 2011 following the reduction in the fees payable by the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecution practitioners. A reduction of 50% was also applied to payments in respect of adjourned sentence hearings and travel and subsistence payments from 2011. As the Deputy will see from the figures above, following these and other measures introduced in the course of 2011, a 10% reduction in expenditure was recorded in 2012 compared with 2011. This was the first substantial reduction ever recorded under this Scheme. Expenditure on the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme is monitored on an ongoing basis with a view to identifying any areas where further efficiencies may be achieved.  <br\/><br\/>I can inform the Deputy that a new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is currently being drafted to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Legislative provisions under consideration include provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, enable the Board to verify the means of applicants and to provide for prosecution of cases of abuse.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400076#WRBB05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":1284,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400077#WRCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1285,"qnumday":474,"qnumall":"[1757\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400077#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide a breakdown, in tabular form, of the most up-to-date numbers of garda&iacute; by district and division; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1286,"content":"<p>One of the primary functions of the Garda Commissioner under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts, is to direct and control An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

In this regard the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Under this model there is a community policing team in each District, headed up by a Sergeant.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.  Within this framework, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to tackle local crime issues including public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities and business groups, including the hospitality industry, to reduce crime and enhance community safety.  This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour and related criminality.<\/p><p>  Particular developments in recent years includes the national &lsquo;Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign&rsquo; which reaffirms the community policing ethos through the hosting of various local activities and as part of which Garda&iacute; give important Crime Prevention and Road Safety Advice.  In addition, new Garda Community Crime Prevention Guidelines, which build on the work of existing partnership programmes such as Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert, were published in January 2013.  The guidelines give information and advice to help establish new community &ldquo;watch&rdquo; groups and also to revitalise existing groups where necessary. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, a new Garda Text Alert Scheme, which was launched in September 2013, was piloted initially in a number of locations and developed in cooperation with Muintir na T&iacute;re, Neighbourhood Watch, the Irish Farmers Association and related stakeholders.  It provides a further mechanism for Garda&iacute; to provide crime prevention information to community contacts who in turn forward the information to all members of a community groups.  This initiative has developed as an important crime prevention mechanism with over 500 local groups involving in excess of 100,000 subscribers and with an estimated 200,000 text messages sent each month under the scheme.  I am informed that every Garda Division, rural and urban, now offers the text alert service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published guidelines to assist in the establishment and operation of local groups. <\/p><p>  I am pleased to say that my Department continues to provide funding for the Community Alert programme, administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re in partnership with the Garda&iacute;, which supports the operation of over 1,300 local groups.

The new JPC guidelines emphasise the need for collaborative approaches between all stakeholders to address local issues.

These include Sports Development Officers (&euro;481,107 in 2014) and St. Catherine Community Sports Centre (&euro;276,110 in 2014). Funding is also provided to national sports organisations including Munster Rugby (443,737 in 2014), Limerick GAA (&euro;43,737 in 2014) and the FAI (&euro;336,146 in 2014) under the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund for specific sports activities for young people at risk of disadvantage. <\/p><p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Budget 2015 has confirmed that funding of &euro;49.93m will again be provided to my Department in 2015 to support the provision of youth services. There will be no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which was a key priority for youth organisations. My Department has commenced work on the detailed allocations for youth services and projects in 2015. Every effort will be made to notify youth organisations and projects of their 2015 allocations in respect of their youth services as soon as possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400078#WRDD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Support Services","counter":1333,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400078#WRDD01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1334,"qnumday":491,"qnumall":"[49650\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400078#WRDD01600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if a decision been made by his Department of the provision of funding to a centre (details sullied) in County Dublin for 2015.","asker":"1008","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1335,"content":"<p>The Centre referred to by the Deputy has sought to be included within the Family Resource Centre (FRC) Programme operated by the Child and Family Agency.  <br\/><br\/>The Agency has advised that it is meeting again with the Centre on 19 January next to discuss its application to join the FRC Programme, having regard to the level of funding available in 2015 in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400078#WRDD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Completion Programme","counter":1336,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400078#WRDD01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1337,"qnumday":492,"qnumall":"[49682\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400078#WRDD01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if the school completion programme funding in Donaghmede, Ayrfield, Kilbarrack and Edenmore areas, Dublin will be protected in 2015; if T&uacute;sla is seeking savings from this programme as it has been cut by 33% since 2008 which has had a huge effect on disadvantaged children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1338,"content":"<p>The School Completion Programme aims to retain young people in the formal education system to completion of senior cycle and to generally improve the school attendance, participation and retention of young people who are risk of educational disadvantage.

In effect, this means that providers of relevant services will acquire a number of statutory obligations. Under the Bill, providers of relevant services are defined as organisations which employ one or more persons. Relevant services are listed in Schedule 1 of the Children First Bill and include leisure and physical activities, such as fitness classes for children. Once the Bill is commenced, a provider of relevant services will  be required to undertake a risk assessment of the potential harm which could come to a child while availing of the services, and to then prepare a Child Safeguarding Statement which outlines the policies and procedures which are in place to mitigate the risks identified. <br\/><br\/>In parallel to the legislative process, my officials are currently revising and updating the existing Children First National Guidance. This is to ensure that the Guidance, which will continue as the basis for all citizens to report concerns, reflects the new legislative obligations and provides, in one place, a complete reference resource for individuals and organisations.  This will provide clarity and ensure consistency between the proposed legislation and the existing non-statutory obligations which will continue to operate administratively for all sectors of society. <br\/><br\/>Requirements in relation to the vetting of persons who work with children are a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality.

The Child and Family Agency, established on 1st January 2014 under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, has statutory responsibility for services previously provided by the NEWB and FSA. In addition, the Agency has responsibility for children and family services previously delivered by the HSE together with domestic and sexual violence services, certain psychological welfare services, and preschool inspection services. The coming together under one Agency of such a range of services provides a platform for the delivery of more efficient and effective services to children and families.  The remit of the Agency will contribute to the achievement of its overall vision, which is seeking to bring about greater integration of services with a focus on early intervention and community engagement.<\/p><p>  As the new Agency subsumed all of the staff and functions of the NEWB and the FSA there have been no savings of any significance accruing.

It involves 124 locally managed projects and related initiatives which operate across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools across the country and  provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children. <\/p><p>  Since 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects. In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million has been provided for the School Completion Programme. The amount allocated to the Programme for 2014-2015 takes account of the savings requirements in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012-2014.

The review of the School Completion Programme is an important initiative in planning for the future development of the programme. It will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future. Preliminary information gathered in the review indicates that the School Completion Programme encompasses a broad and diverse range of measures and interventions that have been developed by local projects over the years. The intention is to learn more about the most successful of these, share the learning across the programme and ensure that available funds are targeted to those services that provide the greatest contribution to good educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of educational disadvantage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400079#WREE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts Data","counter":1377,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400079#WREE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1378,"qnumday":507,"qnumall":"[1662\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400079#WREE01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will provide details of all consultancy firms engaged by his Department during 2014; if he will also provide details of all the relevant fees paid to those firms during the period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1379,"content":"<p>The data provided in the table below relates to consultancy firms engaged by my Department in the year 2014.

As well as contributing to high levels of ED admissions, these factors can present difficulties in discharging such patients to home or other appropriate care settings.  In addition, changes in service provision (e.g. cancer services) have increased the general patient attendance at Beaumont, placing additional pressures on bed capacity.<\/p><p>  All hospitals have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care.  Beaumont Hospital has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve the patient pathway both through the ED and the hospital, in addition to working closely with the community.  All available bed capacity is open and off-site capacity is also being utilised. Elective surgeries (with the exception of cancer cases) have been cancelled for this week and this option is being kept under constant review.  The HSE would encourage patients to contact their GPs in the first instance where they can be directed appropriately to services such as rapid access clinics, day hospital services for older people and acute medical assessment units, as appropriate.<\/p><p>  The Government has provided additional funding of  &euro;3 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges. This funding is being targeted at hospital and community services which can demonstrate initiatives to address specific needs of delayed discharge patients most positively and therefore improve timeliness for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists.  The Minister convened the Emergency Department Taskforce to find long term solutions to overcrowding by providing additional focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by the current trolley waits.  Following an initial meeting in December, the HSE is working on an action plan to be finalised by the end of January to specifically address ED issues with a view to a significant reduction in trolley waits over the course of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400080#WRFF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Data","counter":1414,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400080#WRFF00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1415,"qnumday":521,"qnumall":"[49447\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400080#WRFF00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the timeframe envisaged for completion of the investigation into the work practices of a person (details supplied); his views that the Health Service Executive informed the Joint Committee on Health and Children that there are 29 expectant mothers, which is at odds with a previous parliamentary question reply; if he has examined the HSE's MOU signed by this person; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1416,"content":"<p>As I advised the deputy on 16 December 2014, I still understand from the HSE that the estimated completion date for the two investigations into this issue will be towards the end of the first quarter of 2015.<\/p><p>  My office has been advised by the HSE that 11 mothers of the 12 contracted for Home Births have delivered.

The Scheme was designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial, and aims to minimise the stress for all women concerned.

Importantly Dr. McCoy will particularly focus on involvement of families and their representatives and will begin meetings with families and other stakeholders. <br\/><br\/>It is important that these processes should be allowed to complete their work. The matter will be monitored closely by the Department of Health on an ongoing basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400082#WRHH00600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drug Treatment Programmes","counter":1529,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400082#WRHH00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1530,"qnumday":559,"qnumall":"[49617\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400082#WRHH00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the agency or body which has responsibility for calibrating the commercial methadone pumps which are used by pharmacies to dispense methadone; and if there is an operating procedure in his Department to invigilate and determine the standard of methadone pumps used in pharmacies.","asker":"1190","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":1531,"qnumday":560,"qnumall":"[49618\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400082#WRHH00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to discrepancies between the amount of methadone supplied by manufacturers or distributors to dispensing pharmacies and other methadone outlets; the amount of methadone prescribed to persons in receipt of opioid substitute treatment; if there is a record of any excess of methadone which is supplied to pharmacies and other methadone outlets by manufacturers or distributors but is not prescribed to persons in receipt of opioid substitute treatment.","asker":"1190","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1532,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 559 and 560 together.<br\/><br\/>The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) is the statutory body responsible for the regulation of the practice and profession of pharmacists in Ireland.  PSI Guidelines on the Equipment Requirements of a Retail Pharmacy Business issued in draft form in 2012 and will be published in the PSI January 2015 Newsletter.  These advise pharmacy practitioners that, &ldquo;A high standard of equipment maintenance and cleanliness must be consistently applied. Equipment should be maintained, serviced and calibrated in accordance with the manufacturers&rsquo; instructions and records of such service and calibration should be kept.&rdquo;<br\/><br\/>Currently within the HSE Addiction Treatment Centres the pumps that are used are calibrated by the company contracted to provide methadone to the services.  The pumps are calibrated every six months to ISO standards by an external calibration agency. Each of the centres has Standard Operating Procedures for calibration and maintenance of the pumps. <br\/><br\/>In community pharmacy, pumps are not universally used for the measurement of methadone. Many community pharmacies use CE marked graduated cylinders in general and decant from 500 ml bottles, with the exception of some high volume dispensaries that may use a pump system. <br\/><br\/>The Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988 (S.I. No 328 of 1988) requires pharmacies to maintain a Controlled Drugs (CD) Register in respect of all drugs, including methadone, listed in Schedule 2, with a running balance. Inspections are carried out by the PSI, under Section 67 of the Pharmacy Act 2007.  The sale and supply of all Schedule 2 controlled drugs and the manner in which the CD Register is maintained are checked as part of these inspections. The register is reviewed to see if running balances are properly maintained. <br\/><br\/>Manufacturers&rsquo; bottles of methadone liquid contain a small &lsquo;overage&rsquo; in some cases. The volume declared would be the nominal volume. In other words, if the label states 500 ml then at least 500 ml must be available for administration. That is the standard for medicines, and this means that a slight excess is included to allow the correct volume to be withdrawn. There is no upper limit in the pharmacopoeias (standards).<br\/><br\/>The extra liquid can result in a pharmacy having more methadone than expected in certain circumstances, and this should be accounted for through the regular balance checks and reconciliation. To assist pharmacists in maintaining the CD register for methadone products, PSI Inspectors have provided advice that is now available on the PSI website - .  This advice states that the CD register must be regularly reviewed to ensure the pharmacist can satisfy themselves that the register has been completed correctly for all controlled drugs, including methadone. Excess methadone is always accounted for with the CD register per the guidance that has been issued to account for &lsquo;overage&rsquo;. <br\/><br\/>If there is excess stock compared to the expected balance and the pharmacist is satisfied that this is due to &lsquo;overage&rsquo; from manufacturers&rsquo; bottles, the running balance may be adjusted to reflect the current stock level. This entry should be signed by the pharmacist and annotated to show that the adjustment is the result of &lsquo;overage' and their calculations documented in the CD register.<br\/><br\/>The latest figures available show that a total quantity of 142,119,673 mls of methadone was dispensed through community pharmacies in 2013 for palliative care and for the treatment of opiate dependency.  The total quantity of methadone dispensed through the HSE addiction centres for the treatment of opioid dependency was<i><\/i>73,530,249 mls of methadone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400082#WRHH00900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":1533,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400082#WRHH00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1534,"qnumday":561,"qnumall":"[49629\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400082#WRHH01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Carlow will receive her physiotherapy.","asker":"968","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1535,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.

There is clear evidence that having access to drug treatment is one of the main factors in reducing drug-related deaths.  <\/p><p>  Methadone maintenance treatment is a critical stabilising treatment that enables people to counter their problem drug use.   The HSE provides methadone maintenance in a number of treatment settings to meet the needs of individual drug users.  According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction,  methadone is the most commonly prescribed substitution treatment for problem opiate use in Europe.  In conjunction with other services and supports such as counselling, after-care and training, methadone maintenance treatment provides a pathway to recovery for the individual affected by problem substance use.  <\/p><p>  The HSE Service Plan for 2015 includes an additional &euro;2.1m for addiction services targeting vulnerable problem drug users. These measures include enhanced provision for residential detoxification and rehabilitation facilities and the mainstreaming of needle exchange facilities outside the Dublin area.

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria. The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating. The commonest noticeable evidence of infection is a rash called erythema migrans that is seen in about 80-90% of patients.<\/p><p>  Lyme borelliosis is diagnosed by a medical history and physical examination and can be difficult if there has been no erythema migrans rash. The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies to B. burgdorferi produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection. These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease. The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step. Screening EIA's can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other spirochaete infections including syphilis, and certain viral infections including glandular fever. In addition, sera from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results. Samples giving reactive or equivocal tests in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests. Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity. Using this outlined two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme Disease. Testing for Lyme borelliosis is currently undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.<\/p><p>  There is an ongoing publicity campaign regarding Lyme Disease. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE is establishing a Lyme Borelliosis Sub-Committee with the primary aim to examine best practice in prevention and surveillance of Lyme Disease and to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise harm caused by Lyme borelliosis in Ireland. This will involve raising awareness among clinicians and the general public. It will explore ways to ensure these messages are brought to the general public with the frequency and in forms in which they can be most effective. <\/p><p>  Each year, as part of its ongoing awareness raising regarding prevention and treatment of Lyme Disease, the HPSC holds a Lyme Disease Awareness Week in which media releases are sent out with the intention that media outlets would take up the important Lyme prevention messages. As part of last year's Awareness Week, a supply of information was made available to the public and attention was drawn to a &quot;Tickborne Disease Toolkit&quot;, developed by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC). This toolkit was modified for use in Ireland and posted on the HPSC website. Indeed, the ECDC informed the HPSC that Ireland was the first European Member State to make such extensive use of this material. Following the Awareness Week, a 100% increase of web traffic to the various Lyme Disease sections of the HPSC website was noted. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400083#WRJJ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Consultants Remuneration","counter":1622,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400084#WRKK00125"},{"type":"question","counter":1623,"qnumday":592,"qnumall":"[49764\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400084#WRKK00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the vacant consultant positions at Kerry general hospital will be filled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1624,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

The HSE has appointed a senior manager to lead the reform of the systems for handling medical card application and reviews. <\/p><p>  The HSE is developing a single, integrated process for people to apply for a medical card, a GP visit card, the Long-Term Illness Scheme and the Drugs Payment Scheme. Access points will be established around the country in health offices to support and assist people to make applications. <\/p><p>  A clinical advisory group will be established by the HSE to develop guidance on assessing applications involving significant medical conditions so as to take account of the burden involved and the needs arising from the condition and to ensure that appropriate services are provided to people who need them. <\/p><p>  The Minister and I have asked the HSE to examine, with the Department of Health, the best way to meet the needs of people with significant medical conditions who need the support of the public health system.

This Group will again include health professionals, administrators, researchers, and advocates. In addition, the Group will include a number of new members including a person living with dementia and a representative of those who care for people with dementia.<br\/><br\/>With one exception (because the relevant person is directly involved in implementing elements of the Strategy and is therefore unavailable), all the members of the expert Working Group which assisted in formulating the Strategy have been invited to join the new Monitoring Group.  In addition there will be a number of new members, as follows:<br\/><br\/>- Ms. Helen Rochford-Brennan, who will represent people living with dementia.<br\/><br\/>- Dr. Richard Aboud, who is a General Practitioner.<br\/><br\/>- Professor Eamonn O&rsquo;Shea, who is an expert on ageing issues and will represent Atlantic Philanthropies.<br\/><br\/>- Mr. John Linehan, Head of HSE&rsquo;s Dementia Strategy Implementation Office.<br\/><br\/>The Monitoring Group&rsquo;s remit is as follows:<br\/><br\/>- To monitor and assess progress on the implementation of the recommendations in the National Dementia Strategy;<br\/><br\/>- To identify any factors with the potential to affect the delivery of the Priority Actions, including the three Priority Activities within the Implementation Programme agreed with The Atlantic Philanthropies;<br\/><br\/>- To make recommendations in relation to the manner in which the Strategy is implemented;<br\/><br\/>- To advise on the establishment of a monitoring and reporting framework (to include key performance indicators) which is valid both nationally and locally to track change and improvement over the agreed period in respect of dementia services,<br\/><br\/>- To advise on the commissioning framework for Strategy evaluation following from the Expert Advisory Panel <i>(<\/i>This is a small technical group to advise specifically on evaluation issues),<br\/><br\/>- To report to the Minister of State<b><\/b>for Older People twice yearly on progress made towards implementing the recommendations of the National Dementia Strategy. The Minister will in turn report to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform  <b>. <\/b><br\/><br\/>The Strategy specifically acknowledges the fact that many people under the age of 65 are living with dementia, and both the members of the Monitoring Group and those leading the Strategy&rsquo;s practical implementation are very conscious of the particular challenges posed for younger people by dementia, and of the need to respond to those challenges <br\/><br\/>A number of the priorities identified within the Strategy will be of benefit to people under 65 with dementia. Early diagnosis will assist in ensuring people under 65 will be diagnosed earlier.  A key aim of the Strategy is to identify the services currently available to people under 65, and to plan to address gaps that may now exist. The Dementia Awareness and Stigma Programme element of the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme will seek to increase awareness of dementia in this age group, and to provide more age specific information for them. Six Dementia Advisors (under the aegis of the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland) are also in place in various locations and will support people with a diagnosis of dementia, including those under 65. Early onset dementia may cross a number of care groups, and a HSE Cross Departmental Group will work to integrate service provision for people under 65 with dementia. Consideration will also be given to providing tailored packages of  intensive home supports that are appropriate to younger people with Dementia, as part of the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme.<br\/><br\/>The Strategy&rsquo;s objectives include the need to make hospitals dementia-friendly from admission to discharge or death, which includes environmental aspects as well as clinical support. There is a commitment to the development by the Health Service Executive of a dementia and delirium care pathway, which can be fitted to existing acute care pathways and implemented on a local level in each acute hospital. In addition the HSE will assign responsibility within its own facilities and elsewhere will encourage the assignment of responsibility to a senior clinician within each hospital to lead the development, implementation and monitoring of the care pathway.<br\/><br\/>Hospitals will be required to ensure that people with dementia have a specific pathway through Emergency Departments and Acute Hospital Medical Units that is appropriate to their particular sensory and psychosocial needs. The HSE will develop guidelines on dementia-friendly ward specification to be taken into account at the design stage of all refurbishments and new builds. Elements to be considered should include safe walking spaces and the use of colour, lighting, signage, orientation cues and space used to promote social interaction.<br\/><br\/>Hospitals will prioritise the assessments of social and environmental supports to meet the needs of people with dementia and their carers, including access to appropriate social work support.<br\/><br\/>While exact financial allocations will be firmed up as implementation progresses, our agreement with the Atlantic Philanthropies provides that the &euro;27.5m which is available for the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme will broadly be allocated as follows:<br\/><br\/>Provision of intensive home supports ~ &euro;22.1m<br\/><br\/>Dementia Awareness Programme ~ &euro;2.7m<br\/><br\/>Education programme for GPs\/Primary Care teams ~ &euro;1.2m<br\/><br\/>National Dementia Strategy Implementation Office and supports ~ &euro;1.5m<br\/><br\/>Financial supports for Carers are mainly provided through Schemes administered by the Department of Social Protection. Details of these supports are available on that Department&rsquo;s website (www.welfare.ie), these include - Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Respite Care Grant, and Domiciliary Care Allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400088#WROO05200","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motorised Transport Grant Applications","counter":1872,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400089#WRPP00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1873,"qnumday":683,"qnumall":"[1579\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400089#WRPP00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a replacement scheme for the motorised transport grant and mobility allowance which were abolished by the Government in February 2013, to the detriment of over 5,000 recipients across the country; if he will provide a concrete timeframe for the introduction of the replacement scheme; the reason for the prolonged delay in creating a replacement scheme; if his attention has been drawn to the distress being caused to those with a physical disability who, almost two years on, are still in the dark as to a replacement scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"962","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1874,"content":"<p>Conscious of the reports of the Ombudsman regarding the legal status of the Motorised Transport Grant and Mobility Allowance Scheme, in the context of the Equal Status Acts, the Government decided to close both schemes.

As noted in my press statement of 18 December 2014, this is a positive step towards the normalisation of relations between the two countries.  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the US economic, commercial and financial measures against Cuba are long-standing and clear.  Ireland and the other member states of the European Union are firmly of the view that the lifting of the embargo would facilitate an opening of the island&rsquo;s economy to the benefit of its people.  In addition, we and our EU partners do not believe that the continued embargo contributes in a positive way to the democratic transition in Cuba.  We have expressed this position in our support for the relevant resolutions at the UN General Assembly, most recently on 28 October last year.  We have recorded also our strong opposition to the extraterritorial application of the legislation giving effect to the embargo.    The Deputy will be aware that the US embargo against Cuba is codified in legislation passed by Congress.  President Obama has indicated his willingness to engage with Congress in an honest and serious debate about lifting the embargo.  We welcome the President&rsquo;s efforts in this regard also. <\/p>  <p>  The recent UN debate recorded continued concerns and criticisms regarding governance and human rights in Cuba.  It was noted that while the US embargo has a damaging effect on the Cuban economy, domestic Cuban economic policy seriously hampers its own economic development.  Together with our EU partners we have urged that the package of economic and social reforms adopted by the Cuban Parliament in August 2011 be extended and implemented in a manner that will address the key concerns of the Cuban population. <\/p>  <p>  I urge the Cuban authorities to bring about real improvements in all areas mentioned, and to grant its citizens internationally recognised civil, political and economic rights and freedoms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400091#WRRR01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1989,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400091#WRRR01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1990,"qnumday":726,"qnumall":"[1138\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400091#WRRR01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the total moneys paid by his Department to external consultants, professional companies or advisers under the Action Plan for Jobs in each year since and including 2012; if he will provide in a tabular form the list of those organisations who received money; his Department's procurement policy regarding this work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1991,"content":"<p>No monies have been paid by my Department to external consultants, professional companies or advisors on the Action Plan for Jobs for the period in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400091#WRRR01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":1992,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400091#WRRR01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1993,"qnumday":727,"qnumall":"[1150\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400091#WRRR01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the programmes or schemes his Department currently funds to maintain or increase the number of Irish citizens who gain work experience or full-time employment in the United Nations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1994,"content":"<p>Together with the Department of the Taoiseach, my Department is working with the Public Appointments Service to strengthen our promotion of career opportunities in international organisations, including in the United Nations. <\/p>  <p> Ireland has been a long standing partner of the United Nations Volunteers Programme (UNV), the UN organisation that promotes volunteerism as a means of achieving peace and development.

This year Irish Aid will support the placement of 10 Youth Volunteers.  The UN Specialist Volunteers placements are for a period of 24 months, mainly in Irish Aid programme countries.  In 2014, two Specialist Volunteers were directly funded by Irish Aid and placed with UN Agencies.<\/p>  <p>  UNV also maintains a database of candidates interested in volunteering which it uses to fill volunteer positions with UN agencies in developing countries.

In cases where the Department is notified of the death of an Irish national abroad, the Department will offer the deceased&rsquo;s next-of-kin assistance in liaising with relevant local authorities and organisations as they seek to repatriate their loved one&rsquo;s remains to Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  Whilst the Department provides a highly accessible consular service, given the number of people travelling abroad it is not possible for budgetary reasons for the Department to fund repatriations in the case of death abroad.  The Department strongly recommends to citizens that they purchase suitable travel insurance prior to undertaking their travels, so that they can pay for medical bills and other additional costs as may be required, up to and including the repatriation of remains.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400091#WRRR01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"question","counter":1999,"qnumday":729,"qnumall":"[1381\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400091#WRRR02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to open an office of the Consulate General in Melbourne, Australia; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"1055"},{"type":"question","counter":2000,"qnumday":742,"qnumall":"[1781\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400091#WRRR02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to extend the diplomatic network; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":2001,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 729 and 742 together.<br\/><br\/>The Government decided in January 2014 to expand Ireland's diplomatic network, with the establishment of five new embassies and three new consulates general.

Although it has been our practice not to engage the services of external public relations firms, we have from time to time commissioned consultants or companies with a public relations and communications background to provide other professional services such as project management, logistics and event management.  DHR Communications is the only company which has been contracted since 2010, to manage and administer grants under the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF) and Africa Day celebrations.  The SCMF involves managing three funding rounds each year and managing the SCMF student competition.  This typically involves the following activities:<br\/><br\/>- Convening national and regional information workshops;<br\/><br\/>- Managing and administering the application process;<br\/><br\/>- Organising the judging process;<br\/><br\/>- Providing detailed feedback to all applicants;<br\/><br\/>- Processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records;<br\/><br\/>- Maintaining and updating the SCMF website.  <br\/><br\/>It should be noted that expenses paid to third parties account for approximately 30% of the total paid to DHR for managing and administering the Simon Cumbers Media Fund. This includes costs associated with maintaining and updating the SCMF website, facilitating the judging process and raising awareness of the Fund among journalists.  DHR was awarded a two-year contract to 2012 and was re-engaged in February 2012 for a further two years following a competitive tendering process.  The contract was extended in 2014 for a further year.<br\/><br\/>Following a competitive tendering process, DHR was also engaged to plan, manage and execute a national Africa Day flagship event in Dublin. This includes the administration of a small grants scheme for regional events which DHR managed on behalf of the Department in partnership with a number of local authorities.  DHR also worked to raise public awareness of the Africa Day events, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website. This public awareness work represented a very minor element of the overall project and was conducted in close cooperation with my Department&rsquo;s communications office.<br\/><br\/>Africa Day Family Days were hosted by the Department in Iveagh Gardens in 2009 and 2010, in CHQ in Georges Dock in 2012 and at the Farmleigh Estate in 2013 and 2014.

As the Deputy will be aware, the Middle East is home to the some of the world&rsquo;s most ancient Christian denominations. However, the violence and instability of recent years across the region has had a negative impact on many minority groups in the region, including Christians, with many of them reported to have left the region. <\/p><p>  The European Union supports the protection of fundamental rights for all communities across the wider Middle East and throughout the world. This is reflected in the relevant Council Conclusions from FAC meetings where the EU has consistently voiced its unequivocal concern for the plight of vulnerable groups, including religious minorities, being targeted by extremists, and has strongly condemned acts of violence targeted towards religious and other minorities. <\/p><p>  From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, I can assure the Deputy that we attach great importance to the fundamental rights of freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief. However, in situations of open conflict neither we nor the EU have any means to offer direct physical protection to populations located in combat zones. Whenever possible, we raise the issue of the safety of Christians and other religious minorities with the national governments through the appropriate bilateral and multilateral channels and consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of all minority groups.

I also raised it during my meeting with UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon. <\/p><p>  In cases such as Syria and Iraq, where the collapse of national government authority across large areas has been a key factor leading to the problem, the restoration of control by broadly accepted authorities is a critical prerequisite for safeguarding minority communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400092#WRSS00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Issues","counter":2025,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400092#WRSS00450"},{"type":"question","counter":2026,"qnumday":738,"qnumall":"[1772\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400092#WRSS00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the outcome of the Stormont talks involving the Irish and British Governments and the five Northern Ireland Executive parties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":2027,"content":"<p>Following eleven weeks of discussion, political talks in Stormont House, Belfast concluded successfully on 23 December. The Stormont House Agreement covers a broad range of political, social and economic issues and has the potential to advance significantly its twin aims of reconciliation and economic renewal.  It sets out a plan for financial and budgetary reform.  It proposes a way forward on flags, identity, culture and tradition through the establishment of a commission. It envisages the devolution of responsibility for parades to the Northern Ireland Assembly. It establishes a programme of institutional reform at Stormont and progresses a number of outstanding aspects from the Good Friday and St Andrews Agreements.   Very significantly, it establishes a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the legacy of the Past. This framework includes an oral history archive; a dedicated independent Historical Investigations Unit which will investigate Troubles-related deaths; and an Independent Commission on Information Retrieval to enable victims and survivors, North and South, to seek and receive information about the death of their loved ones.<\/p><p>  As is the case with all participants in the talks, there were a number of additional issues which the Government would have wished to see progressed further but there was not sufficient consensus among the parties at this time.  <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding that it was included in a paper tabled by the Government at the outset of the talks, we were disappointed that a commitment to an Irish Language Act, either enacted in Westminster or the Northern Ireland Assembly, did not form part of the final Agreement.  We welcome, however, the explicit endorsement in the Agreement by the British Government of the principle of respect for and recognition of the Irish language in Northern Ireland.   <\/p><p>  Similarly, while the Government would have wished to see the establishment of a North South Consultative Forum and a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, the necessary enabling consensus was not forthcoming during the Stormont talks.  The Government will nevertheless avail of other opportunities to secure progress on these outstanding issues.<\/p><p>  The months of the negotiations involved a huge commitment from both Governments and from all of the parties concerned.  As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is conscious of our responsibilities to all of the people of this island.   In the months ahead, we will continue to advance political progress and to play our part in the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement. To this end, I will be attending the first quarterly meeting to review progress on implementation of the Agreement later this month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400092#WRSS00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"question","counter":2029,"qnumday":739,"qnumall":"[1773\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400092#WRSS00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding the proposal to establish a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"question","counter":2030,"qnumday":740,"qnumall":"[1774\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400092#WRSS00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding the proposed Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"question","counter":2031,"qnumday":741,"qnumall":"[1775\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400092#WRSS00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding the proposal to re-establish the Northern Ireland Civic Forum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":2032,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 739 to 741, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  Key outstanding matters from the Good Friday and St Andrews Agreement were discussed in the recent Stormont House talks.  In relation to the particular outstanding matters raised by the Deputy, the following is the position.<\/p><p>  During the course of the talks, the Government advanced the view that a Bill of Rights could set out precisely and formally the rights upon which a shared society for Northern Ireland could be based. Sufficient consensus between the Northern Ireland Executive Parties did not exist to take this forward within the context of the Stormont House Agreement. However, the final Agreement provided that the parties commit to serving the people of Northern Ireland equally, and to act in accordance with the obligations on government to promote equality and respect and to prevent discrimination; to promote a culture of tolerance, mutual respect and mutual understanding at every level of society, including initiatives to facilitate and encourage shared and integrated education and housing, social inclusion, and in particular community development and the advancement of women in public life;  and to promote the interests of the whole community towards the goals of reconciliation and economic renewal.<\/p><p>  It is a matter of regret that agreement could not be reached on an Irish Language Act as part of the Stormont House Agreement.  While the St. Andrews Agreement did provide a commitment to introduce an Irish Language Act, the British Government made it clear during the recent talks that, as language matters were now devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, it would not legislate at Westminster for such an Act. It was equally clear that the necessary consensus among the parties for such legislation in the Northern Ireland Assembly was not forthcoming. <\/p><p>  Nevertheless, the Stormont House Agreement does contain an important and formal recognition by the British and Irish Government of the need for respect for, and recognition of, the Irish language in Northern Ireland.    An Irish Language Act remains an outstanding matter.  The Government will continue to advocate for its enactment and to encourage those Northern Ireland parties which currently support an Act to continue to build the necessary enabling consensus among their Executive colleagues.<\/p><p>  In line with the Good Friday Agreement, a Northern Ireland Civic Forum was set up in October 2000 but was suspended, along with the Northern Ireland Assembly, in 2002. Following the restoration of devolved powers in May 2007, the then First Minister and deputy First Minister considered the position of the Civic Forum in the re-established devolved arrangements and commissioned a review of the effectiveness and appropriateness of its structure, operation and membership.   <\/p><p>  The Government believe that greater civic engagement would stimulate informed public debate in Northern Ireland in relation to key societal challenges. This was the position put forward by the Government in the recent Stormont House talks.   I welcome that the Stormont House Agreement provides for the establishment of a civic advisory panel to meet regularly on key social, cultural and economic issues and to advise the Northern Ireland Executive.  <\/p><p>  The Government will continue its efforts to ensure that the full potential of the Agreements is realised towards achieving effective partnership government, genuine reconciliation between divided communities and economic prosperity for all in Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400092#WRSS01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2033,"content":"<p>Question No. 742 answered with Question No. 729.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Religious Persecution","counter":2034,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400092#WRSS01250"},{"type":"question","counter":2035,"qnumday":743,"qnumall":"[1782\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400092#WRSS01300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the measures being taken at a national and an EU level to address the persecution of Christians across the world; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":2036,"content":"<p>Ireland condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur or who are the victims.

We consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including the EU and UN.  I highlighted the issue when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on 29 September 2014.  I also raised it during my meeting with UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon.<br\/><br\/>Ireland works within and alongside the EU to address<i><\/i>the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013. These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected. They also elaborate an EU strategy on how to engage with third countries on the right to freedom of religion or belief, a strategy which we hope to see bear fruit as we assess the implementation of the Guidelines.<br\/><br\/>The EU leads resolutions on freedom of religion or belief at both the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and at the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva, of which Ireland is currently a member. Ireland is an active participant in the negotiation of these resolutions.  In 2014, the EU-led resolutions on freedom of religion or belief were successfully adopted without a vote by the HRC (March 2014) and by the UN General Assembly during its 69th session (December 2014).

At the HRC, Ireland has actively participated in the negotiations of, and co-sponsored, resolutions on the elimination of discrimination against women; violence against women; female genital mutilation (FGM); preventable maternal mortality and morbidity; realising the equal enjoyment of the right to education by every girl; and strengthening efforts to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage.<br\/><br\/>The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a unique peer review mechanism whereby the human rights records of individual states are reviewed in the UN Human Rights Council.  Ireland is an active participant in the UPR, and regularly raises concerns in relation to the promotion of women&rsquo;s rights and equality.<br\/><br\/>The protection and fulfilment of women&rsquo;s human rights is also a priority for Ireland at the UN Third Committee, which deals with social, humanitarian and human rights issues.  At the Third Committee, Ireland has led negotiations for the EU on resolutions on women human rights defenders, and on trafficking in women and girls.  <br\/><br\/>As part of our commitment to advancing gender equality, Ireland played a key role in the establishment of UN Women, and is an active participant in the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), which is the principal global policy-making body on gender equality and the advancement of women.  Ireland presented its candidature in November 2014 to one of the seats on the CSW for the term 2018 &ndash; 2022. If elected, this will be the first time that Ireland has served on the Commission, and will enhance our commitment to the promotion of gender equality.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has also been a strong advocate of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security and has taken a leadership role in the international arena calling on other states to commit to implementation of this resolution. The resolution calls for an increase in the participation of women in peacemaking and peacebuilding processes; the protection of women and girls in armed conflict; and the incorporation of a gender perspective into peacekeeping and peacebuilding processes.  In 2011 Ireland adopted its first National Action Plan on the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1325 for 2011-2014. This Plan has been recognised as a model of best practice internationally in terms of civil society involvement in drafting and monitoring.<br\/><br\/>Today, I was very pleased to launch Ireland&rsquo;s second National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security (2015-2018). The Plan outlines the steps Ireland will take in order to ameliorate the unique adverse effect of conflict on women and girls, and to increase the empowerment and participation of women in decision-making in conflict and post-conflict situations. <br\/><br\/>Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls are priorities in our official development assistance programme.  All recipients of Irish Aid funding are required to demonstrate their commitment to these goals. Both bilaterally in our engagement with partner countries, and at the UN and in other multilateral bodies, we consistently emphasise the importance of gender mainstreaming as a key aspect of ending poverty, hunger, discrimination and vulnerability across the globe.<br\/><br\/>Currently, the final phase of the post-2015 negotiations on a new framework for global development is getting underway at the United Nations.  Those negotiations will produce a set of Sustainable Development Goals which are expected not only to continue the effort to eliminate extreme poverty but also address areas of climate, governance, consumption and production and economic growth and be universally applicable to all countries. Ireland has been consistent in the post-2015 negotiations to date on the need for a strong goal on gender equality and women's empowerment, as well as effective mainstreaming across all other goals, targets and indicators.  Such a goal would reflect the renewed commitment to fulfilling our obligations to dismantle the structural underpinnings of gender inequality, transform gender relations and effect positive change in the lives of all women and girls. We are also prioritising an end to gender-based violence, which remains the most pervasive yet least recognized human rights abuse in the world.<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font><br\/><br\/>In 2008, the EU adopted guidelines on violence against women and girls and combating all forms of discrimination against them.  The EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy was adopted in 2012 and states that the protection of the rights of women and protection against gender-based violence is a clear priority for the EU. The EU also regularly raises abuse of the rights of women in human rights dialogues with third countries and gives support to civil society initiatives which tackle gender-based violence and feminicide.<br\/><br\/>I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to advocate for the respect, protection and fulfilment of women&rsquo;s human rights worldwide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400092#WRSS01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":2040,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400092#WRSS01650"},{"type":"question","counter":2041,"qnumday":745,"qnumall":"[1794\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400092#WRSS01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of EU directives which remain to be implemented within his Department;

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p><p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.

It recognises and rewards skills which cannot readily be assessed through externally assessed written final examinations.  It encourages teachers to collaborate and provides a forum for discussing and sharing good practice and resources that enhance the quality learning and teaching.<\/p><p>  School based assessment enables teachers to shine a light on the unique talents and skills of students, it enables teachers to differentiate the learning, tailoring it to the unique ways and needs of their students. School-based assessment leads to the setting of more meaningful tasks that relate directly to what is learnt.  Ultimately it creates opportunities for the student to succeed. School-based assessment enables students to make considered decisions about their work, in natural and comfortable conditions and in their own time. This helps students to illustrate what they know and are capable of achieving in normal conditions.  It allows for a much more rounded picture of student achievement to emerge.<\/p><p>  In the context of an external examination, many teachers have experiences of their best students or a student that has worked exceptionally hard receiving a grade that is neither representative of their ability nor indicative of their potential. This grade, a once off judgement, fails to capture the richness of that student's contributions to class discussions, their willingness to help less-abled students, the hours they spent putting projects together, their ability to ask challenging questions and to engage critically. It fails to do justice to the three years of hard work, commitment and dedication that the student exemplified.  It concentrates on the performance in one exam rather than on the process of learning.<\/p><p>  An external terminal exam, such as the Junior Certificate, can impact not only on students' learning but also on the way teachers' teach.  It can lead to teaching to the rest.  An external terminal exam takes place at the end of a period of learning and only provides limited information about students' competences when they have already finished the Junior cycle Programme.<\/p><p>  The benefits of having teachers assess their own students' work, is based on a range of international research findings.  Assessment should assist students in the quality of their learning and not be regarded as the end point. Assessment is not about &quot;proving&quot; but about &quot;improving&quot; learning outcomes. Research shows that unless assessment changes, nothing else will.<\/p><p>  My November proposal includes a combination of both types of assessment.  There will be a final exam worth 60% and 40% will be awarded for school based assessment.  The State Examination Commission will check 10-15% of the school based assessment to ensure consistency and fairness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400094#WRUU03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Educational Disadvantage","counter":2148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400094#WRUU03200"},{"type":"question","counter":2149,"qnumday":782,"qnumall":"[1076\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400094#WRUU03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if there is a bursary scheme for children graduated from DEIS schools; and if so, the application procedure for this scheme.","asker":"1017","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":2150,"content":"<p>In 2012, the Minister for Education and Skills established a scheme of bursaries for students from DEIS schools based on Leaving Certificate examination results and other criteria, such as approved courses and approved institutions.<\/p><p>  Applications are not required for these bursaries as a minimum of 10 will be automatically offered on a regional basis (Dublin City and County, rest of Leinster, Munster and Connaught\/Ulster) with additional awards being provided on pro-rata basis. <\/p><p>  The amount of the bursary will be &euro;2,000 per student per year of their course and will be paid as a single payment at the beginning of the academic year.

Prior to this, teachers entered on the second or third point of the salary scale as they were entitled to incremental credit in respect of their professional training.<br\/><br\/>Arising from the public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments, the Government decided to withdraw or modify allowances for new beneficiary public servants with effect from 1 February 2012.

Once up and running other secondary purposes of POD will include becoming the basis for the allocation of teachers and capitation grants.  Aggregated POD data will also be used for the production and publication of primary level statistics.  A PPS number is an individual's unique identification number for all dealings with the Public Service, including Social Welfare, tax, education and health services.  Having the PPSN on the database will help ensure that there are no duplicate records in the system i.e that two schools do not have the same child on their roll. In the future we will be able to track pupils from early childhood education, to primary school and onto post-primary, which will allow us to ensure that every child in the State of compulsory school age is in education.  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, Section 262 allows for the collection of the PPSN by schools and the Department of Education and Skills:Section 262 of the Act states (4) A person shall give to a specified body his or her personal public service number and the personal public service numbers of his or her spouse and children, where relevant, as required by the body for the purposes of the person's transaction.

The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.<\/p><p>  The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998, as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012.  The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance matters for the school management authorities.<\/p><p>  We have a growing population of young people in this country.  Despite the difficult financial circumstances we face as a country, we have prioritised education so that the number of teachers we have in the system has grown to protect pupil-teacher ratios. Between this year and last year, this has involved an increase of approximately 2,300 teachers in our primary and post-primary schools.  This is a very significant investment at a time of scarce resources.<\/p><p>  While there has been a moratorium on recruitment across other sectors in the public service, this has not applied to teaching.  This shows the commitment this Government has to educating our future generations.  The main priority for any additional resources for the foreseeable future will be to cater for the continuing increase in demographics at all levels within the education system.<\/p><p>  Arrangements for the staffing and redeployment process for the 2015-16 school year are under way in my Department.  The staffing arrangements for the 2015-16 school year will be published on the Department's website shortly.  The final staffing position for all schools at post-primary level will ultimately not be known until the autumn.  At that stage, the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400096#WRWW00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teachers'

As this was a complex development, there was a number of subsequent communications with the software provider to clarify various aspects of the specification.<\/p><p>  The software was delivered for testing on 16 October 2014.  Due to the complexity of the system and the number and range of employees, all software enhancements have to be robustly tested to ensure there is no adverse impact on any aspect of the overall payroll operation.  A further complication in this instance was the requirement to test this software in conjunction with other software to calculate or recalculate Haddington Road Agreement allowances taking account of the impact of increments and allowances for those reaching &euro;65,000.  The testing of this software to defer increments took longer than originally anticipated and was not completed in time for the payroll issues in December 2014.  As the software was initially developed to process employees due a deferred increment in the payroll period being processed, further software was needed to process employees due deferred increments from December 2014.   The Department's software provider was engaged on 19 December 2014 to provide this additional software, which was delivered for user acceptance testing on 8 January 2015.  This software is currently undergoing robust testing with target dates for the payment of the deferred increments and arrears to primary teachers and special need assistants on 12 February 2015 and to post-primary teachers on 19 February 2015.<\/p><p>  The overall cost of the software for the deferral of increments is approximately &euro;64,000, including VAT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400096#WRWW02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":2253,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400097#WRXX00200"},{"type":"question","counter":2254,"qnumday":824,"qnumall":"[1530\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400097#WRXX00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if increments due to be paid to staff in her Department were paid on the due date.","asker":"999","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":2255,"content":"<p>Most civil servants were historically placed on a pay scale with annual increments up to a maximum level and after that, 2 Long Service Increments (LSI's) after 3 and 6 years respectively.

A reduction of 2 days annual leave for next three years; or 2. 2 days unpaid leave for next three years (subject to management approval); or 3. Cash deduction from salary of equivalent amount; or 4.

The 2004 Act provides that rents may not be greater than the open market rate and may only be reviewed upward or downward once a year unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation that warrants a review. Tenants must be given 28 days&rsquo; notice of new rent and can make an application for dispute resolution to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) where they feel the rent increase is in excess of the market rent. These provisions have effect notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in a lease or tenancy agreement. <br\/><br\/>I am very conscious of the difficulties caused by rising rents. In the third quarter of 2014, rents were 5.6% higher nationally than in the same quarter of 2013 , according to the most recent rent index from the PRTB. Rents for houses were 4.3% higherin the third quarter of 2014, while apartment rents were 7.3% higher than in the same quarter of 2013. In Dublin, which is seeing the highest rates of increase nationally, overall rents were higher by 9.5%. <br\/><br\/>Ultimately, the main cause of rising rents is a lack of supply in the market and the recently published <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020<\/i>sets out clear, measureable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list.

The elected members of each local authority will then have a number of months to make the first rent scheme under the 2009 Act and I expect that theywill comply with the law in this matter. <br\/><br\/>Section 31 rents are expected to be introduced on 1 July 2015 with housing authorities having a 2-year transition period during which they will continue to set rents at their discretion for their own housing stock and for leased properties, including dwellings provided under the Rental Accommodation Scheme. The introduction of the rent framework will mean that, on the expiry of the 2 year transitional period, the amount of rent payable by some households may be lower in some cases, and higher in others, than the rent currently payable under section 58 of the Housing Act 1966. The transition period will give housing authorities the opportunity to move in incremental steps towards the rent levels that will apply on expiry of the transition period.<br\/><br\/>The details of the new rent framework are being finalised in the context of the drafting of the forthcoming Regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400102#WRCCC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tenant Purchase Scheme Administration","counter":2496,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400102#WRCCC02900"},{"type":"question","counter":2497,"qnumday":921,"qnumall":"[1322\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400102#WRCCC03000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to put in place a new tenant purchase scheme for local authority houses; if and when this will take place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":2498,"qnumday":927,"qnumall":"[1485\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400102#WRCCC03100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when the new tenant purchase scheme which was announced will become operational; the terms and conditions thereof; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":2499,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 921 and 927 together. <br\/><br\/>Part 3 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 provides for a new scheme for the tenant purchase of existing local authority houses which will replace the 1995 scheme and the once&ndash;off 2011 scheme, which closed in June 2014 and June 2013, respectively.<br\/><br\/>The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020<\/i>, which was published in November 2014, includes a commitment to introduce the new tenant purchase scheme by the second quarter of this year.

Where the tenant purchaser resells the property before the end of the charge period, he or she will be required to pay back to the housing authority a portion of any profits arising from the sale, thereby compensating the State for its loss on the original sale of the property and generating funds for the local authority to invest in new social housing or the refurbishment of existing housing.<br\/><br\/>Full details of the new scheme will be set out in regulations that I will make as part of the introduction of the scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400102#WRCCC03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inni&uacute;lacht sa Ghaeilge sa St&aacute;t Seirbh&iacute;s","counter":2500,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400102#WRCCC03300"},{"type":"question","counter":2501,"qnumday":922,"qnumall":"[1430\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400102#WRCCC03400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"bunaithe ar an treoir a thug an Roinn Caiteachas Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe do gach Roinn, cad &eacute; l&iacute;on agus cad iad gr&aacute;id na bpost d&aacute; mbeidh st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh at&aacute; inni&uacute;il sa Ghaeilge agus sa Bh&eacute;arla ag teast&aacute;il; cad &eacute; l&iacute;on na bpost sin a bhfuil duine leis an gcumas cu&iacute; Gaeilge agus B&eacute;arla iontu cheana f&eacute;in, arna bhriseadh s&iacute;os de r&eacute;ir gr&aacute;id; c&eacute;n ch&aacute;il&iacute;ocht Ghaeilge at&aacute; riachtanach do na poist sin; i gc&aacute;s nach bhfuil an treoir &oacute;n Roinn Caiteachais Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe comhl&iacute;onta, cad &eacute; &uacute;dar na moille agus c&eacute;n uair a dh&eacute;anfar an scr&uacute;d&uacute;; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":2502,"content":"<p>Mar chuid d&aacute; Phlean&aacute;il d&rsquo;Fh&oacute;rsa Saothair, rinne mo Roinn imscr&uacute;d&uacute; ar l&iacute;on na bpost ina bhfuil inni&uacute;lacht sa Ghaeilge agus sa Bh&eacute;arla ag teast&aacute;il.

The NORA levy was increased from 1 cent to 2 cent per litre on 1 October 2009. In respect of the period 2008-2014, as per the Financial Statements, the NORA levy income was as follows: 2008 - &euro;81.4m, 2009 - &euro;93.3m, 2010 - &euro;137.7m, 2011- &euro;126.7m, 2012 - &euro;120.2m, 2013 - &euro;120.4m, 2014 (estimated) - &euro;118.4m. <br\/><br\/>The Agency is responsible for ensuring that Ireland meets its obligations under EU legislation (Directive 2009\/119\/EC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) Treaty to maintain a minimum of 90 days stocks of strategic emergency oil stocks for use in the event of an oil supply disruption. This is the main purpose of the NORA levy. As of 31 December 2014, NORA&rsquo;s oil stocks amounted to 1.5 million tonnes, covering its obligations of 90 days oil stocks. Ireland&rsquo;s strategic oil stocks are held either in Ireland or in another EU Member State with whom Ireland has a bilateral stockholding agreement. Up to 2008, a large portion of stocks were held abroad and a large proportion of stocks were held as stock tickets (contracts to deliver oil in an emergency) rather than as physical oil stocks. At end 2008, 42% of Ireland&rsquo;s obligation was covered by stock tickets and 53% of stocks were held abroad.<br\/><br\/>In order to improve resilience and oil security in response to a potential oil supply disruption, the Government set an objective in 2007 that the strategic oil stocks should be rebalanced to maximise Ireland&rsquo;s wholly owned stocks of oil and the level of stocks on the island subject to increased storage availability and value for money considerations. This is in line with the EU Directive which obliges Member States to ensure stocks are physically available and accessible in an emergency. <br\/><br\/>Significant progress has been made in recent years by NORA in procuring additional storage specifically in Ireland, building physical stocks (rather than relying on stock tickets), rebalancing stocks in light of changing consumption trends and upgrading stocks in line with EU fuel specifications. NORA has been maximising its storage on the island of Ireland and has refurbished tanks in Dublin, Kerry and Antrim increasing by 350,000 tonnes the amount of strategic oil storage on the island. NORA has also been rebalancing the composition of stocks stored to reflect national consumption trends of petrol, diesel, gasoil, kerosene (heating), aviation fuel and fuel oil. NORA also has to fund the ongoing storage costs of holding these significant volumes of oil. <br\/><br\/>Of the stocks held by NORA at the end of 2014, approximately 68% were held as stocks on the island of Ireland, 30% as stocks abroad and 2% in Stock Tickets. In managing Ireland&rsquo;s obligations, NORA is subject to euro dollar exchange rate changes, fluctuations in oil prices and variances in funding costs and interest rates. NORA has succeeded in reducing the Agency&rsquo;s debt from &euro;444m at the end of 2008 to &euro;111m at the end of 2014. NORA&rsquo;s work in the period 2008-2014 has substantially improved Ireland&rsquo;s oil resilience and security of supply improving the availability and accessibility of oil stocks in an emergency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400103#WRDDD04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Post Office Network","counter":2557,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400103#WRDDD04600"},{"type":"question","counter":2558,"qnumday":944,"qnumall":"[49444\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400103#WRDDD04700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will support the future of the post office network in 2015 as a matter of priority.","asker":"1017","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":2559,"content":"<p>It is Government policy that An Post should remain a strong and viable company, in a position to provide a high-quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer-focused network of post offices in the community.<\/p><p>  Following a review under the auspices of the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy, a Post Office Network Business Development Group is being established to explore the potential opportunities for new Government and commercial business for the post office network.

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.<br\/><br\/>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades. Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br\/><br\/>On the 24 November last, a public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 was launched. The map can be accessed at . The areas on the map marked Blue will all have access to high speed broadband services of at least 30mbps from the commercial sector by end of 2016. The areas marked Amber will require the intervention of the State and includes Ballyclough, Co Limerick.<br\/><br\/>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises \/ home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands in every county in Ireland, including Co Limerick. <br\/><br\/>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.<br\/><br\/>The next steps in this process will see a further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy in mid-2015. This is a requirement under EU state aid rules.<br\/><br\/>A detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a potential preferred bidder or bidders towards the end of this year and in this regard the Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost to taxpayers as low as possible. It is expected that the physical build of this network will commence from 2016. <br\/><br\/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government.

The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, are a matter in the first instance, for the many commercial players who operate in the Irish market. Therefore, decisions on when and where to locate investment are always taken on commercial grounds, having regard to the likely return on investment. Under EU Commission's State Aid guidelines, the State is prohibited from providing any financial assistance to any commercial operator for the expansion of their broadband service.<\/p><p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) is a commitment to ensure that every citizen and business in Ireland has access to high quality, high speed broadband. This will be delivered through a combination of commercial and state investment.<\/p><p>  The recent engagement between my Departmental officials and the telecommunications industry has highlighted the large number of small-scale local wireless operators who are currently providing broadband services to many local communities nationwide. This engagement has also highlighted the issues small operators have today to meet local demand for high speed broadband and the high cost associated with upgrading their services.<\/p><p>  If any of these companies can demonstrate beyond doubt that they have the capability and resources to provide high speed broadband through their own investment then we will include them on our coverage map and the State led intervention will not be rolled out in these areas.<\/p><p>  Even if these operators cannot afford to invest in their networks, I still see a major role for these companies as we will be providing the necessary funding to ensure a wholesale network is available that will be fully open to any retail operator who wishes to offer high speed broadband services to business or residential customers. Given the established customer base of many of these local companies I am confident that the NBP intervention will enable them to offer significantly enhanced services to their customers. My Department will be launching a procurement process later this year to award a contract or contracts for the roll out of the high speed network and all companies, large and small, may have an opportunity to be part of this process and receive funding for the network build.<\/p><p>  Charges for connection to the Distribution System are calculated by ESB Networks Ltd and approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).

There is no price control in the oil sector and it is Government policy to encourage price competition and consumer choice. Responsibility for gas market regulation is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation. As such, I have no statutory function in the setting of gas, oil, petrol or diesel prices.The competitive energy market results in choices for consumers and businesses in terms of suppliers, products and prices and exerts downward pressure on prices. Consumers can try to mitigate electricity prices by shopping around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers. Measures such as comparison websites, approved by the CER, exist to assist them in this endeavour.<br\/><br\/>The CER is focussed on actions that can mitigate costs for business and domestic customers, including rigorous regulatory scrutiny of the network costs component of retail prices.<br\/><br\/>The latest EUROSTAT figures, published by the SEAI on the 9<sup><\/sup>December 2014 show all business consumption bands in both electricity and gas experienced reductions in average prices in the first half of 2014, ranging from 0.7% to 4% in electricity and 6.7% to 12.9% in gas. <br\/><br\/>Similarly, EUROSTAT figures show a reduction of 5.7% in the average price of gas in the residential consumption band with the largest share of the market, while the average price of electricity in the residential consumption band with the largest share experienced a reduction of 1.3%.<br\/><br\/>Households can also reduce their energy costs by being energy efficient. There are energy efficiency measures to assist business and domestic energy consumers, with significant funding allocated to them.<br\/><br\/>There is a role for the Consumer and Competition Commission in ensuring that markets are functioning well and that consumers are not being disadvantaged. Previous investigations and surveys into oil prices, including home heating oil, have been undertaken by the National Consumer Agency (now the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission), and these are available at . Home heating oil surveys have been carried out by the National Consumer Agency on a regular basis. The latest heating oil survey indicated variations in price and the Agency encouraged consumers to shop around and get a number of quotes. The research indicates that the price paid by consumers is largely determined by taxation levels, the internationally traded price of crude oil and the consequent price at which refined product is traded in Europe, along with the level of competition in the retail market.<br\/><br\/>The European Commission maintains a Statistics and Market Observatory, which presents consumer prices and net prices (excluding duties and taxes) of petroleum products in EU Member States (known as the Oil Bulletin) on a weekly basis. The Oil Bulletin is designed to improve the transparency of oil prices and to strengthen the internal market.

The nature of the surfacing provided on individual greenways would depend on the route to be traversed and it would not be unusual for portions of a\u00a0single greenway to have different surfaces.<\/p><p>  There is no one size fits all for greenways,\u00a0each greenway will be assessed on its individual merits.<\/p><p>  The permissive access model is a worthy mechanism for certain cycling and walking projects, particularly on a local level. It is a low cost community based model that provides access to the natural environment without interfering with the property rights of the landowners concerned. <\/p><p>  In terms of the best land access models for greenway delivery, the use of publicly owned land is advantageous from the perspective of reducing costs.  Negotiated permissive access, from the perspective of cost and public ownership, continues to have value but, for projects of national scale, consideration must be given to land purchase by agreement or if necessary by CPO.  The process of obtaining permissive access is resource intensive especially\u00a0where agreement would need to be secured with hundreds or more landowners.  Greater investment is now being provided for greenways and it would be precarious to rely on permissive access where the associated agreements may be withdrawn at any time without recourse to the State.  Of course, as already stated, it will be a matter for all developers of cycling infrastructure to consider access to land on a case by case basis and to take a multi-criteria approach in the route selection process.  The key consideration should always be to select an approach that will maximise the future use of the amenity concerned.  There are no plans within my Department to make future funding awards for greenways conditional on an authority having permanent access to those sections of\u00a0the lands through which a greenway traverses.<\/p><p>  In the context of developing major cycling infrastructure projects that traverse long sections of privately owned land, such as the Dublin &ndash; Galway greenway I fully support the need to consider negotiated financial agreements or, if required, CPO.

Major rail projects, such as Luas Cross City, will help supplement the range of viable low carbon alternatives to the car.<\/p><p>  The potential of rail freight in emissions reduction is also a consideration.  Total rail freight tonnage transported on the rail\u00a0network in 2013 was 589,000, an increase of 4% on 2012, and 90.8 million tonne kilometres.  Irish Rail is actively pursuing rail freight expansion opportunities and engaging with ports, exporters and industry to identify viable commercial rail\u00a0freight solutions.<\/p><p>  In recent years, good progress has also been made in the area of energy efficiency with correlated reductions in emissions.

In this regard, my Department conducted a critical examination of the structure and operation of the institutions included in the Public Service Reform Plan and developed a comprehensive and practical approach to the implementation of the various Government Decisions in this area.<\/p><p>  Savings were made primarily in three ways:<\/p><p>  - Through the ending of payments to Chairpersons and members of boards or advisory councils;<\/p><p>  - Through a programme of shared services between institutions, including, for example, in retail, security, marketing, procurement and storage; and <\/p><p>  - Through the provision of services by my Department to some institutions, including human resources services and financial services, thus relieving those institutions of the need to incur a cost in accessing these services. <\/p><p>  The functions of Culture Ireland were merged fully into my Department during 2013 and the Board was replaced with an Expert Committee whose members provide their time on a pro bono basis.  In addition, the term of office of the Placenames Commission expired in October 2012 and was replaced by an Expert Committee which also operates on a pro bono basis. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, a formal Framework for Co-operation and Improved Services between the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Crawford Art Gallery was developed and endorsed by Government.  Arising from that, the three Galleries signed a formal Service Level Agreement outlining a number of specific measures to share a number of services across the three Institutions.  Legislation has been prepared to give effect to these changes and to reduce the number on boards, provide for pro bono service and gender equality on each board.<\/p><p>  In December 2013, a new Human Resources Shared Services Unit was established in my Department to provide HR support to the National Museum of Ireland. Work is continuing between the National Museum of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland and the National Archives of Ireland to improve co-operation between these institutions and to progress shared services. Legislation to formally enact these changes and changes to board structure is being progressed.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that this programme of change has made a significant contribution to achieving the overall &euro;20m savings target set out in the Public Service Reform Plan, while at the same time enhancing the operations of the bodies concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400109#WRKKK02100","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Decentralisation Programme Data","counter":2850,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400109#WRKKK02125"},{"type":"question","counter":2851,"qnumday":1044,"qnumall":"[1023\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015011400109#WRKKK02200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the agencies or sections from her Department that were decentralised during the period 1997 to 2011; the travel costs and expenses incurred by decentralised personnel travelling to their base Department in that period.","asker":"1058","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":2852,"content":"<p>78 staff of my Department are based in two locations - New Road, Killarney (44 staff) and Newtown Road, Wexford (34 staff) &ndash; that were established under the Decentralisation Programme announced in 2004.
