At this revised strength ceiling, the existing organisational structures that had been in place for a strength ceiling of 11,500 personnel were no longer viable. Accordingly I initiated a major reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force. The purpose of the reorganisation is to ensure that within the reduced strength, the operational effectiveness of the Permanent Defence Force is prioritised. <\/p><p>  In July of this year, the Chief of Staff and Secretary General submitted agreed reorganisation proposals for my consideration, which I accepted. These proposals had due regard to Defence Forces operational requirements and the Chief of Staff confirmed that the proposals would ensure that the Permanent Defence Force could continue to meet all operational requirements within a strength ceiling of 9,500 personnel.<\/p><p>  The recommendations outlined a Permanent Defence Force Army structure based on two Brigades with the brigade headquarters located in Cork and Dublin. Other key aspects of this reorganisation included the consolidation of under-strength Units and the disestablishment of certain units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and a re-deployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational Units. As part of this process, the number of Army infantry battalions will reduce from nine under-strength infantry battalions to seven full strength infantry battalions. In Dublin two under-strength infantry battalions are being consolidated into one full strength battalion. <\/p><p>  A fundamental and major organisational change such as this one required a holistic approach rather than focusing on local issues and concerns. The proposed future location of Headquarters and Units were contained in the recommendations I received from the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General having regard to Defence Forces capability and operational requirements. I accepted these recommendations in full. <\/p><p>  The implementation of the reorganisation is underway and all personnel in the Permanent Defence Force have now been briefed on the reorganisation proposals. They will receive further briefings and advice on the many options available to them as implementation of the reorganisation progresses. <\/p><p>  The Green and White Paper process is scheduled for completion by the end of 2013. In the context of the immediate financial realities and in order to maintain the operational capabilities of the Permanent Defence Force to the greatest extent possible, it was neither prudent nor practical to delay a reorganisation of the Defence Forces until 2014. <\/p><p>  I am firmly committed to maintaining the capacity of the Permanent Defence Force to meet their operational requirements. The current reorganisation is an essential part of that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700061#WRB02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700062#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[48489\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700062#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"when he will next attend an EU meeting with his counterparts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":39,"content":"<p>During each European Union Presidency both formal and informal meetings of Defence Ministers are held.

In the interests of bringing forward these savings to the paybill, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform wrote to my Department instructing management to immediately engage with staff interests with a view to securing their early agreement to the elimination of certain Defence Forces allowances.<\/p><p>  While Military Service Allowance and some other allowances may be considered to be part of core pay it is important to understand that the term &quot;Allowances&quot; in the Defence sector covers a variety of payment types that are very different from each other. Some are intended to reimburse expenses and do not actually form part of remuneration. Some payments are made in recognition of particular technical or professional qualifications while other allowances recognise particularly onerous duties whether at home or overseas that fall outside the norms taken into account in setting basic pay while also reflecting the fact that the Defence Forces do not receive overtime.<\/p><p>  It is also important to recognise that almost two thirds of the payments on allowances is accounted for by the top three categories of allowance, that is, Technician Pay, Security Duty Allowances, and Overseas Peace Support Allowances. The Technical Pay and Security Duty Allowance had previously been selected for review as part of the Defence Sectoral Croke Park Agreement and are currently being addressed with the Representative Associations in accordance with agreed procedures under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Defence Forces.

However, the White Paper on Defence (2000) provides for a security role for the Naval Service and the Air Corps to support the civil authorities in this area and assistance in the prevention of drug smuggling is recognised as a very important part of their duties.<\/p><p>Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking.  The Naval Service, as a member of the Joint Task Force, is also committed to an international initiative, the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &ndash; Narcotics, (MAOC-N). The Centre which was established in 2007 has led to a greater focus on intelligence exchange amongst countries to tackle large drug shipments by sea. MAOC-N was set up by seven European countries and is designed as an international co-ordination force with access to national tasking agencies and requires participation and resources from all active members.An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service have full-time officers based at its Centre in Lisbon. Irish Naval Service personnel travel to the Centre when requested by the Joint Task Force.<\/p><p>  The Naval Service operates eight general purpose patrol ships, which are tasked with coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State.The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time.All vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on patrol.As the need arises, Naval Service vessels are deployed on drug interdiction operations.  A contract was placed in 2010 for the provision of two new Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) for the Naval Service.The acquisition of these new vessels will ensure that the Naval Service can continue to carry out its drug interdiction role in support of the Joint Task Force as well as its other taskings. The first vessel is scheduled for delivery in early 2014.The second new vessel will follow one year later.<\/p><p>  The Air Corps are also involved in efforts to prevent drug trafficking.The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft. These CASA aircraft have an important surveillance capability which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service in patrolling our Irish Exclusive Economic Zone.  Both Casa aircraft underwent mid-life upgrades, which were completed in 2008. The upgrades included the fitting of state-of-the -art surveillance and communication equipment.  The Air Corps has also, on occasion, carried members of the Customs National Drugs Team in an observational capacity for the purposes of monitoring vessels suspected of smuggling drugs.  I am satisfied that both the Air Corps and Naval Service have the necessary resources to meet all their operational requirements including the support of the civil authorities in the prevention of drug smuggling into this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700062#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":55,"content":"<p>Question No. 25 answered with Question No. 17.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":57,"content":"<p>Question No. 26 answered with Question No. 24.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Archives","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700063#WRD00250"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[48561\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700063#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if there is a timescale for the release of the military pension records.","asker":"1015","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":60,"content":"<p>The Military Service Pensions Archive project is a cornerstone of the Government Centenary Programme.

Our contribution is a Reconnaissance Company together with staff posts at both the Operational and Force Headquarters amounting to approximately 175 personnel. During the stand-by period one officer has been deployed to the Battlegroup Headquarters in Ulm, Germany. This officer is engaged in training and planning activities.

The other members of the Nordic Battlegroup were Sweden, acting as Framework Nation, Finland, Norway, Estonia and Croatia (2011 only).  <\/p><p>  Any decision by Ireland to participate in a specific Battlegroup operation is subject to our national sovereign decision-making procedures - &ldquo;Triple Lock&rdquo;, i.e. UN mandate, Government and D&aacute;il approval.

The capabilities and the requisite high-end equipment in respect of Ireland's contributions to the Battlegroups already reside within the Defence Forces.  No military equipment has been purchased specifically for EU Battlegroups.

Unlike the Nordic Battlegroup, there were no joint field exercises or manoeuvre training with other elements in the Austro-German Battlegroup.

Mr Brahimi enjoys the full confidence of the EU and of the international community as he endeavours to broker an early cease fire and to build on the earlier peace efforts undertaken by his predecessor, Kofi Annan.  He is continuing to work closely with all members of the UN Security Council and with regional actors in an attempt to devise a political way forward.  He has also recently met with Syrian Government and Opposition representatives. <\/p><p>  There will also need to be accountability for the very many serious human rights violations and war crimes committed during the conflict.  The latest report of the UN Commission of Inquiry has clearly recognised that opposition forces are also guilty of committing gross human rights violations, though to a lesser extent than the Syrian Government.  Ireland has consistently and strongly condemned all abuses and crimes and has called for the perpetrators, no matter who they are, to be brought to justice.  That is why I continue to support the calls which have been made for the situation in Syria to be referred by the Security Council to the International Criminal Court.<\/p><p>  Ultimately, it remains for the Syrian people themselves to determine who should lead a new democratic, inclusive and pluralist Syria.  Ireland and its EU and international partners will continue to support all efforts to end the violence and suffering of the Syrian people and to promote the earliest possible political settlement and transition within Syria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700064#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":85,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[48864\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700064#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will support the Argentina Republic on the issue of sovereignty of the Malvinas and to challenge the United Kingdom refusal to resume negotiations on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":86,"content":"<p>The question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) has been the subject of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, as well as its special committee on decolonisation.

I have been informed that each application for flood cover is considered on a case by case basis, as this allows an insurance company to properly assess the risk it is accepting.  The significance of these risks is reflected in the fact that the IIF has indicated that the cumulative cost of the eight major flood events since the year 2000 has been &euro;697 million. <\/p><p>  The State has made a significant contribution to reducing the threat of flooding through a very significant investment in major urban flood defence schemes since 1995 and this has been hugely beneficial in terms of properties protected and losses avoided.  It is estimated that almost 8,000 properties have been protected to date and the value of the benefit deriving from that is of the order of &euro;800 million.  <\/p><p>  The approach agreed by the Government in order to ensure reasonable priced flood insurance is provided is twofold and works to improve the availability of flood insurance cover by (a) continuing prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the OPW and relevant local authorities, and (b) improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry in order to reach better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas and how this can allow more effective insurance cover.  <\/p><p>  Continued communication between the insurance industry and the OPW is critical to ensure that individual underwriters are aware of what is being done in different parts of the country to address flooding problems including time scales, completion of flood prevention measures, level of expenditure and likely completion dates.  In the same way a flow of information from the insurance industry will undoubtedly help the OPW and local authorities prioritise remedial works which in turn should provide greater reassurance to the industry that problem areas are being addressed in a structured way and this should lead to a greater willingness to provide cover in marginal areas.<\/p><p>  As part of this, officials in the OPW have been working on developing a system for presenting information on flood defence schemes to the insurance industry to meet the technical requirements set out by the industry for risk assessment purposes.  On 5 July 2012, the OPW made a presentation to the IIF and a number of the main insurance companies on a proposed template for providing the required information.  The essential focus and objective of OPW's work has been in putting flood defence information on a GIS platform.  This means that the information will be accessible and viewable in a mapping environment.<\/p><p>  I understand that the IIF has indicated that it is in the process of collating the responses it has received from its members on the OPW information and it hopes to be in a position shortly to formally respond on this.  I note that the Chief Executive of the IIF stated in a recent presentation to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht that   &quot;one of the positive developments over the past couple of years is that there has been much more engagement on a bilateral basis with the OPW&quot;.  He acknowledged that the flow of information is much improved and that the insurance industry is much more involved in the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700064#WRE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Meetings","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700065#WRF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[48761\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700065#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of occasions on which he or his officials have met with the Irish Bankers Federation;

The incentive is designed to help companies to raise new risk capital to expand their activities. An individual investor can obtain income tax relief on investments up to a maximum of &#8364;150,000 per annum, subject to the high income individuals' restriction, in each tax year up to 2013.

However, in general, the marginal tax rate, which is described as the tax rate that applies to the last euro of the base, is an important consideration in the formulation of tax policy.  Marginal tax rates are important because they influence individual decisions to work more.  The OECD in its working paper &lsquo;Tax and Economic Growth&rsquo;  points to the &ldquo;possibility that high top marginal rates will increase the average tax rates paid by high-skilled and high-income earners so much that they will migrate to countries with lower rates resulting in a brain drain which may lower innovative activity and productivity&rdquo;. <\/p><p>  It is also important to point out that higher marginal tax rates for earners may also incentivise a greater level of tax evasion and contribute to the development of a shadow economy.<\/p><p>  Regardless of the state of the economic cycle, gross migration flows to and from Ireland are very large in comparative terms, indicative of the extremely open nature of the Irish labour market.

Where the &ldquo;specified minimum income&rdquo; requirement is not met and if the person decides not to purchase an annuity, he\/she, as an alternative, can invest in an AMRF.  The &ldquo;specified income requirement&rdquo; applies to all AMRF holders<\/p><p>  The capital amount that must be invested in an AMRF is 10 times the annual rate of the State (Contributory) Pension, currently &euro;119,800 or, if lower, the balance of the pension fund after the person concerned has taken his\/her permitted tax-free lump sum payment.  <\/p><p>  Unlike an ARF, only income growth in excess of the original capital investment may be withdrawn from an AMRF.  <\/p><p>  An AMRF converts into an ARF once the AMRF holder reaches the age of 75 years or he\/she satisfies the &ldquo;specified minimum income&rdquo; requirement, at which point withdrawals of the capital may be made from the ARF (that is, the converted AMRF). <\/p><p>  It is important to bear in mind that the capital in an AMRF may be used, at any time, to purchase an annuity that would be payable for the duration of the person&rsquo;s life but the capital in the AMRF is not otherwise available to the beneficial owner of the AMRF.  The reason for this is because the AMRF fund is designed to meet the income requirements in the latter part of a person&rsquo;s life (that is, from the age 75 onwards) in a situation where that person does not have alternative income source\/s of an amount that equates to 1.5 times the rate of the State (Contributory) Pension.   <\/p><p>  In my reply to the previous question referred to by the Deputy, I outlined in considerable detail the changes made to provide flexible options at retirement for individuals in Defined Contribution pension arrangements, including the rationale for the &ldquo;specified minimum income&rdquo; requirement and the approved minimum retirement fund (AMRF) outlined above. I also outlined the changes made in Finance Act 2011 to extend the flexible options and to modify the conditions relating thereto.<\/p><p>  I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the person referred to in the details supplied with this question took out his AMRF a little over a year ago and after the Finance Act 2011 changes but presumably in the knowledge of the conditions attaching to investment in such a fund.<\/p><p>  At this point, the only immediate option open to the person concerned to access the capital in the AMRF (based on the information available) would be to use the funds to purchase a pension annuity. He would not be obliged to use all of the funds in the AMRF for this purpose unless he decided to do so and any lifetime pension annuity would count (together with any State Pension Contributory to which the person may be entitled in the future) towards meeting the &ldquo;specified minimum income&rdquo; requirement which, if or when satisfied, would allow any remaining AMRF funds to be converted to an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) with unfettered access to the capital before age 75, subject to taxation. <\/p><p>  I have no plans to adjust the &ldquo;specified minimum income&rdquo; requirement at this time. However, I have received a number of representations about the scale and timing of the increase in the requirement introduced in Finance Act 2011 and I will examine these matters again without prejudice in the context of next year&rsquo;s Finance Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700066#WRG00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700067#WRH00150"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[49026\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700067#WRH00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if and or when the Revenue Commissioners will be in a position to come to an agreement in the form of deferred payments or liability in the matter of outstanding income tax liability including penalties in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.

Currently there are 19 state funded providers of ITE (and three non-state funded) offering more than 40 college programmes in primary and post-primary teaching.  The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that a smaller number of centres for ITE exist, but that they offer education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education.  These centres for teacher education will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions. The new configurations will mean strong research bases can be created in each centre.<\/p><p>  The HEA has been requested to consult with the relevant parties and to prepare a detailed plan on how to implement the recommendations of the Panel.

However, the potential viability of the business proposal is the dominant factor in any credit decision made by Microfinance Ireland.<\/p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 also includes a number of specific measures aimed at supporting employment in the retail sector. These Actions are for delivery across a number of Departments and agencies and include:<\/p><p>-a renewed focus on prompt payments to business, <\/p><p>-an assessment of the potential for future development of the retail sector, <\/p><p>-the introduction of a Statutory Code of Practice for Grocery Goods;<\/p><p>-the enactment of legislation to reform the statutory wage setting mechanisms; and<\/p><p>-the acceleration of the programme of revaluation of commercial premises, which will provide a basis for the adjustment in commercial rates. <\/p><p>Other initiatives which the Government introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative in May 2011 also continue to help support employment in the retail sector. These include the halving of Employer&#8217;s PRSI on earnings up to &#8364;356 per week and the reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate to 9% on certain goods and services.<\/p><p>My officials and I meet with representatives of the retail sector to hear the challenges they face.

Full deployment of the new system for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was completed in June 2012.<\/p><p>  Following the completion of the modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project was completed for the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs.  The first step in the elimination of the backlog is to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deal with new work as it arrives.  The outcome of the review is the division of work into two streams.  One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Additional resources have been  added to the backlog clearance team.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives.  A noted increase in the number of claims processed was achieved in September and October, where claims processed substantially exceeded claim intake, and this increase continues into November.  However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.  The allocation of available resources to this task continues to be monitored. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700074#WRP00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":280,"content":"<p>Question No. 108 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Appeals","counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700074#WRP00650"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[48868\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700074#WRP00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a disability allowance appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":283,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 24th   August 2012.

The procurement of products or services by a local authority is a matter for the authority concerned.  Notwithstanding this, guidelines by the National Public Procurement Policy Unit (NPPPU) of the Department Public Expenditure and Reform apply to all public sector bodies, including local authorities.      <\/p><p>  I am advised that t he rules on awarding public contracts have provisions which allow the specification of social criteria, such as the requirement for employment of long term unemployed, as a condition in the performance of the contract.   Any such provisions must be compatible with EU law, i.e. they must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States.   Subject to this, contracting authorities have the discretion to apply such conditions, as appropriate.   <\/p><p>  Under the EU Directives on public procurement, public works, supplies and service contracts above certain thresholds must be advertised in the Official Journal of the EU and awarded on the basis of objective and non-restrictive criteria.  For contracts below these thresholds, the general requirement is that they be advertised on the national public procurement website  or, depending on value, awarded on the basis of a competitive process of direct invitation to an adequate number of suitable suppliers.   <\/p><p>  The aim of the rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of nationality and where the EU Directives apply there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. <\/p><p>  The local government sector avails of a number of shared procurement mechanisms already in place (nationally &#8211; National Procurement Service (NPS) frameworks, LA Quotes\/Bitumen, and regionally &#8211; library service procurement, public lighting maintenance, debt collection, paid parking, etc.), and local authorities will support and operate under Mandatory Frameworks for procurement as they are developed. <\/p><p>  A new procurement governance structure is currently being put in place in the local government sector comprising a lead procurement local authority (Kerry County Council), specialist procurement support units and regional procurement co-ordinators. In addition, each county and city council has a designated Procurement Officer in place.   <\/p><p>  Government initiatives in relation to procurement are reshaping the way the State and business engages in relation to acquisition of goods and services. Sensitivity regarding Small and Medium Enterprises ( SMEs ) is needed to maximise local buy-in particularly with regard to pre-qualification criteria required in order to meet eligibility thresholds when tendering for public contracts.  In this regard, while local authorities provide a measure of support for SMEs in engaging with procurement processes (e.g. the LA Quotes website) they will work with the National Procurement Service as they further develop and disseminate guidance in order to assist SMEs in tendering for public contracts, and assist local authorities doing a similar job locally. <\/p><p>  As part of the implementation of the local government sectoral strategy to promote employment and support local enterprise, Supporting Economic Recovery and Jobs &#8211; Locally , local authorities will also work as necessary with the responsible State   agencies in the development of the Procuring Innovation initiative (Action 3.53 of the Action Plan for Jobs) to increase the purchasing of innovative solutions from SMEs by encouraging a more flexible approach to tendering that focuses on procuring solutions to specific needs, rather than specific products or services.  In view of the importance of improving the capacity of SMEs to compete under the framework agreement approach, local authorities will also work with Enterprise Ireland to ensure that pre-qualifying criteria for the award of public contracts that are subject to frameworks will be proportionate to the relative value of the contract, so that pre-qualification is not unnecessarily weighted against SMEs.   <\/p><p>  While public procurement policy addresses the inclusion of social clauses in public contracts, the application of such clauses in public contracts is a matter for each contracting authority concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700078#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Issues","counter":372,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700078#WRT00750"},{"type":"question","counter":373,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[48998\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700078#WRT00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the position regarding a housing situation (details supplied)","asker":"1017","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":374,"content":"<p>The circumstances referred to relate to a private transaction in which my Department has no remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700078#WRT00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700078#WRT01000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Registration Authority","counter":375,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700078#WRT00950"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[48874\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700078#WRT01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the total number of staff employed by the Property Registration Authority at each of its offices; if the property is leased, and if so when the lease expires; the maximum staffing capacity of leased properties; the future plans if any for each property; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":377,"content":"<p>The Property Registration Authority (PRA) was established on 4 November 2006 under the provisions of the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006 and is responsible for managing and controlling the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry.

I look forward to the outcome of this process so that a properly considered and strategic response can be put in place, to supplement the existing crime prevention and detection operations which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have in place to tackle this type of crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700080#WRV01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700080#WRV01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Reserve","counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700080#WRV01350"},{"type":"question","counter":424,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[48809\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700080#WRV01400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will ensure that the FCA unit in Longford Town continues in operation, as it was promised that it would remain open in Longford following the closure of Connolly Barracks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":425,"content":"<p>A Value for Money review of the Reserve Defence Force was recently completed and submitted to myself and the Secretary General of my Department for consideration.

However, the White Paper on Defence provides a role for the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this work.  In this regard, the Air Corps and the Naval Service provide support to these agencies as the need arises and within their available capabilities.    A Service Level Agreement is in place with the Irish Coast Guard which sets out the search and rescue assistance that the Air Corps and Naval Service can provide to the Coast Guard. The provision of onshore assistance by Air Corps helicopters for mountain rescue operations is covered in the agreement as is the fixed wing top cover by the Air Corps Casa aircraft to Coast Guard helicopters offshore.  Assistance that is provided by the Naval Service to the Coast Guard during maritime search and rescue and recovery operations is also included in the Service Level Agreement.<\/p><p>  Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking.  The Air Corps provide air support and, on occasion, carry the Customs National Drugs Team in an observational capacity for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking and other illegal activities.  There is close co-operation between the civil authorities and the Naval Service and the Air Corps in discharging this important mission.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, Ireland along with other EU Member States participate in the EU Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &ndash; Narcotics (MAOC-N).  This Centre has led to a greater focus on intelligence exchange amongst countries to tackle large drug shipments by sea.  MAOC-N was set up by seven European countries and is designed as an international co-ordination force.<\/p><p>  Naval Service vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on fishery patrol. The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of territorial waters using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.  These aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and communication equipment which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service in patrolling the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone. <\/p><p>  In relation to maritime surveillance generally, an Inter-Departmental Maritime Surveillance Working Group, chaired by the Department of Transport, was established under the auspices of the Marine Co-ordination Group.

Indigenous production of cereals is of course, an important part of primary agriculture production.  In addition to generating an income for our tillage farmers, the cereals sector is a key source of grain for the milling and malting industry and feeding stuffs for the livestock sector.<b><\/b>  Annual cereals production in Ireland has fluctuated around 2 million tonnes in recent years and it is desirable to try and sustain this level of production in order to avoid over dependence on imported cereals. According to the CSO Cereals Supply Balance sheet, Ireland had 74% self-sufficiency in cereals in 2010\/2011. Imports of cereals in that period amounted to 938,000 tonnes, down 14% or 155,000 tonnes on the previous year. <\/p><p>  Since Ireland is a deficit market for cereals, prices here are greatly affected by world prices and supplies.  In 2010, increased demands for grain from the biofuels sector and the growing needs of new emerging markets like China and India drove up world grain market prices.  In line with this rise in world prices, grain prices in Ireland increased and growers here reacted by increasing the acreage sown.  This resulted in a bumper harvest in 2011 with total grain production of almost 2.5m tonnes. The preliminary estimate for the 2012 grain harvest is forecast to be lower than the record harvest of 2011 due to the persistent adverse weather during the growing season and will be of the order of 2 million tonnes, despite a significant increase in cereal area planted in 2011. <\/p><p>  This is consistent with the long-term average production of 2 million tonnes but 20% lower than the 2011 harvest figure of 2.5 million tonnes, which was exceptionally high. <\/p><p>  My Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the efficiency of, quality and viability of cereal production. These services include seed certification, seed testing and recommended list of varieties. In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for cereal producers. The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereals producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world. <\/p><p>  Ireland is also a significant importer of field vegetables and potatoes. Most of the Department&#8217;s efforts, along with those of the State Agencies involved with the horticultural industry, are focussed on increasing production for the domestic market.   The opportunity for increasing outdoor horticultural crops production has become more difficult over the past five years.  This is due to scale of the industry, our costs of production, competition from major suppliers around the world and the controls exercised by the supermarkets. The very difficult weather conditions over the past 5 years, including 2 very severe winters plus the very poor summer weather this year, have further restricted the industry&#8217;s capacity to expand production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700084#WRZ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licences","counter":481,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700084#WRZ01150"},{"type":"question","counter":482,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[48843\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700084#WRZ01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will expedite the processing of applications for aquaculture licences in Castlemaine harbour, County Kerry; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that these delays are hindering investment in the industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":483,"content":"<p>Castlemaine Harbour is designated as a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive and a Special Protection Area under the EU Birds Directive (Natura 2000 site).<\/p><p>   My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, has engaged in a major programme to gather the necessary baseline data appropriate to the conservation objectives of aquaculture sites located within designated Natura areas, including Castlemaine Harbour. <\/p><p>  The setting of Conservation Objectives and the carrying out of an Appropriate Assessment for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the conservation objectives has been completed in respect of Castlemaine.

Ireland is strategically placed to be a key supplier of quality meats, dairy products, beverages, seafood and other products and services to China.  In 2011, Ireland exported &euro;244m of these products to China.  In the first six months of this year, Ireland has exported &euro;181m in dairy products, pigmeat, seafood, beverages and other agri-related products to China. This is a 39% increase on the same period last year, at which time we had exported &euro;130m.  Total exports of Irish seafood to China in 2011 were &euro;2.9 million, but the latest data up to July 2012 shows exports of seafood at &euro;5.3 million, representing an 80% increase on 2011. This dramatic increase demonstrates the new business relationships Ireland has developed with key Chinese buyers. <\/p><p>  Last April I lead the largest ever Irish agri-food trade delegation to China, with representatives from the meat, dairy, seafood, beverages, bloodstock and agri-services sectors and government bodies. The trade delegation which my Department, Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland brought together, comprised of a total of 51 Irish companies and 127 individual.  This was in addition to Government agencies such as Teagasc, BIM, the Marine Institute, the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency, Irish Thoroughbred Marketing and leading universities involved in the provision of educational courses in food safety and agricultural science. <\/p><p>  During the Trade Mission, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between my Department and the Chinese Inspection and Quarantine Service (AQSIQ) on (i) sanitary and phyto sanitary issues, including provision for the establishment of a joint working group on SPS issues, b) the export of horse feed to China, and c) renewal of the bovine semen protocol was concluded.  The MOU between my Department and the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture on Mutual Cooperation in the Agri-food and Fisheries areas was also renewed and a new MOU was signed between the Marine Institute and the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences; this MOU builds on research work between the two institutions, facilitated by the Action Plan which I agreed with the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture in May 2011 on Mutual Cooperation.<\/p><p>  In addition, some significant commercial outcomes were also achieved during the visit including the announcement of a $50 million project involving an Irish company in a joint venture in establishing a major Chinese equine facility; market access and conclusion of a contract by an Irish company for the supply of horsefeed to China, the first foreign company to gain such a contract; the signing of agreements between BIM and eight Irish Seafood companies to supply China with commercial samples of boar fish to China; the conclusion of an agreement by an Irish dairy company on an increased volume of dairy and nutritional ingredients to be supplied to the Chinese market and the launch of a range of Irish dairy products on the Chinese market.<\/p><p>  Meeting were also held with  a range of number of Chinese food companies which have lead to increased business opportunities and in one case a significant partnership agreement in terms of the supply of infant formula has since been concluded.<\/p><p>  Since my visit there have been a number of follow on visits to Ireland by Chinese Ministers including Vice Minister Gao Hongbin of the Ministry of Agriculture with responsibility for Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Controls, who visited in May and Vice Minister Wei Chuanzhong of AQSIQ who visited in June. This latter visit resulted in the signing of Protocols on the direct export of horses from Ireland to China and on the export of fresh porcine semen to China. In addition, an MOU was concluded on the setting up of a technical working group on BSE, for market access for Irish beef. That working group has now been established. <\/p><p>  The Mayor of Nanjing, Ji Jianye, who I met when in China also made a visit to Ireland in August, and was accompanied by one of the world&rsquo;s largest pigmeat processors. There have also been follow up visits in relation to the purchase of thoroughbred horses.  In relation to the seafood sector, trade in boarfish with China has commenced and opportunities for developing this trade are being assessed. <\/p><p>  At government agency level, the Chinese Academy of Fisheries Science made a return visit in July of 2012 to investigate research possibilities with the Marine Institute. The areas of aquaculture and fisheries technology and sea food safety were of particular interest, and the group were shown the Institute&rsquo;s research activities in bio-toxin chemistry, fish stock assessment, micro-tagging of hatchery juvenile fish and fish genetics. Continuing collaboration is currently being scheduled. In October AQSIQ visited the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency.<\/p><p>  Following from the Irish\/ Sino Forum on Building a Safe and Sustainable Future of Food Production, which took place during my visit to China, Teagasc and the Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences are now developing a Memorandum of Understanding which it is envisaged will lead to collaborative research between both Institutes.<\/p><p>  While all these developments have led to greater cooperation and the deepening of relationships and trust at Ministerial, official and business level, which is crucial to trade in China, the evidence of the importance of this relationship to the Irish agri-food and seafood sector is reflected in the trade statistics and the continuing growth in our exports to China.<\/p><p>  Overall, I am very pleased with the outcome of my trade visit to China and the very important follow up in terms of return visits by Ministers and industry, the growing collaboration between government agencies in areas of research and mutual cooperation and the tangible commercial outcomes. I would anticipate that our agri-food and seafood exports to China will continue to grow. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700085#WRAA00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Suckler Welfare Scheme Applications","counter":491,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700085#WRAA00350"},{"type":"question","counter":492,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[48915\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700085#WRAA00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a suckler cow grant in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Sligo will issue; the reason for the delay in processing this application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":493,"content":"<p>An error identified with the application concerned has now been resolved and payment will issue in the near future to the applicant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700085#WRAA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licences","counter":494,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700085#WRAA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":495,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[48997\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700085#WRAA00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding the planned development of certified organic salmon production units at deep sea sites off the Irish coast; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"997","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":496,"content":"<p>Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) has submitted an application for an aquaculture licence for the cultivation of finfish near Inis Oirr in Galway Bay.

The prices of such drugs vary between countries for a number of reasons, including different prices set by manufacturers, different wholesale and pharmacy mark-ups, different dispensing fees and different rates of VAT. <\/p><p>  Following intensive negotiations with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the Department of Health and the HSE have reached agreement on a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State. The main provisions of the new Agreement are as follows:<\/p><p>  -With effect from 1st November 2012, the ex factory price of all patent protected medicines reimbursed in Ireland prior to September 2006 will be realigned - downwards only - to the average of the basket of 9 countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, and UK). <\/p><p>-With effect from 1st November 2012, the ex factory price of all patent expired medicines which do <i>not<\/i>   have a generic equivalent on the Irish market will be realigned - downwards only - to the average of the basket of 9 countries.<\/p><p>-With effect from 1st November 2012, the ex factory price of all patent expired medicines which <i>have <\/i>  a generic equivalent on the Irish market will be reduced to 60% of the original price. With effect from 1st November 2013, the price will be reduced to 50% of the original price.<\/p><p>-In the case of medicines which go off patent after 1<sup>st<\/sup> November 2012, the ex factory price will drop to 70% of the original price as soon as a generic equivalent comes on the Irish market. After 12 months, the price will be reduced to 50% of the original price. <\/p><p>-With effect from 1st January 2013, the ex factory price of medicines introduced to Ireland <i>after <\/i>September 1<sup>st<\/sup>   2006, will be realigned - downwards only - to the average of the basket of 9 countries.<\/p><p>  The deal will deliver a number of important benefits, including<\/p><p>  -significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs,<\/p><p>  -a lowering of the drugs bill to the State,<\/p><p>  -timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions,<\/p><p>  -reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.<\/p><p>    This deal, combined with an interim agreement reached with IPHA in the Summer, means that &#8364;16 million in drug savings will be made this year. It is estimated that the deal will generate savings of up to &#8364;116m in 2013, &#8364;136m in 2014 and &#8364;150m on 2015.  <\/p><p>    The Department and the HSE have also completed discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry, and have secured similar reductions in the price of drugs supplied by AMPI member companies.  <\/p><p>    The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  It aims to promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for medicines resulting in savings for taxpayers and patients.  It should lead to an increase in the rate of generic prescribing, thus generating further savings in drugs expenditure in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700088#WRDD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Debt Collection Agencies","counter":568,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700088#WRDD01900"},{"type":"question","counter":569,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[48993\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700088#WRDD02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of debt collection agencies employed by the Health Service Executive in 2011 and 2012 for the recoupment of moneys owed; the amount recouped in those years; the cost to the Health Service Executive of employing such agencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":570,"content":"<p>I have referred this matter to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700088#WRDD02100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":572,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700089#WREE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":573,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[49024\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700089#WREE00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding home help in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 5; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1027","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":574,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700089#WREE00300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":575,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700089#WREE00350"},{"type":"question","counter":576,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[49046\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700089#WREE00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Wexford will receive a hospital appointment as a matter of urgency","asker":"1096","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":577,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700089#WREE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards","counter":578,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700089#WREE00550"},{"type":"question","counter":579,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[49051\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700089#WREE00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a drug (details supplied) is still available under the medical card scheme; if not, the reason for its withdrawal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":580,"content":"<p>In the current financial environment the Health Service Executive (HSE) is facing a challenge to deliver services in a way that will minimise any adverse impact on patients and continue to protect, as far as possible, the most vulnerable citizens.

Around 60% of these questions concern operational issues and are referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to Deputies. Many of these questions relate to individual patients and local day to day operational matters.<\/p><p>  Parliamentary Questions relating to operational issues of a national scale or importance are answered by myself or the relevant Minister of State instead of being referred to the HSE. Whenever possible these questions are answered on the relevant D&aacute;il sitting day. Where this is not possible because the information is not readily available, a reply is issued as soon as possible thereafter.  These are classified within my Department as Ministerial Response questions.<\/p><p>  The statistical data sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of PQs referred and response times since 2005 is set out below. From 2006 to 2007 the Executive worked to a timeframe of issuing responses to directly referred PQs within 20 working days of receipt. From 2008 this was reduced to 15 working days.<\/p><p>  2005 - 2,388 referred - average response rate not available<\/p><p>  2006 - 3,060 referred - 55% answered within 20 days<\/p><p>  2007 - 2,744 referred - 65% answered within 20 days<\/p><p>  2008 - 3,544 referred - 73% answered within 15 days<\/p><p>  2009 - 3,145 referred - 62% answered within 15 days<\/p><p>  2010 - 2,550 referred - 53% answered within 15 days  (Performance in this year was affected by prolonged industrial action) <\/p><p>  2011 - 2,464 referred - 58% answered within 15 days<\/p><p>  2012 - 3,049 referred - 75% answered within 15 days<\/p><p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that responding to the information needs of the Oireachtas is a priority both for my Department and the Executive. As noted above, the Executive is committed, in the 2012 National Service Plan, to answering 75% of directly referred Parliamentary Questions within a period of 15 working days of receipt. Performance in relation to this target it is currently being met and will continue to be monitored closely.  The Executive  introduced a new I.T. system in the last quarter of 2011 and this has  led to a significant improvement in its overall response time to referred questions. The most recent statistics available for this year (up to October 9th) show that of the 3,049 questions referred for direct reply this year, 2,274 (75%) have been answered within the 15 day timeframe. Taking into account questions which took longer than the 15 day timeframe to answer, the figures show that 2,981 (98%) of referred questions have now been answered. The figures for Ministerial Response questions show that of the 496 questions referred to the Executive for input, 464 (94%) have been answered in full.  Regular meetings are held with the HSE's Parliamentary Affairs Division to monitor response times and to emphasise the importance of issuing timely and comprehensive replies to Deputies. <\/p><p>  Questions concerning individual patients and operational matters relating to local issues will continue to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to Deputies. While my Department has ultimate accountability for the health services, it is my belief that a balance has to be struck between responsibility for local issues, which rests with local area service managers, and the ultimate accountability of Ministers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700090#WRFF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":604,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700090#WRFF00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme","counter":603,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700090#WRFF00750"},{"type":"question","counter":604,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[48776\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110700090#WRFF00800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the date on which he expects to publish the list of grants under the 2012 sports capital grant programme.","asker":"993","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":605,"content":"<p>My Department has received over 2,170 applications for funding under the 2012 Sports Capital Programme.\u00a0 This is the largest number of applications ever received under the Programme.
