However, more work, including additional appraisal drilling, will be necessary to determine if the discovery, which was originally made by Esso in 1973, can be declared commercial and progress to a petroleum production project.<\/p><p>  In relation to recent media reports on the potential of the Rathlin Basin, I understand that these reports relate to an initial resource assessment of a prospect that has yet to be drilled.  As this area is outside the jurisdiction of this State I have no function in the matter.<\/p><p>  While there has been a modest but welcome upturn in the level of interest in exploration off our coast in recent years, the reality is that the only commercial discoveries of hydrocarbons made in the Irish offshore to date are the three producing gas fields in the Kinsale area, along with the Corrib gas field, which was discovered in 1996.  There have been no commercial discoveries of oil.<\/p><p>  Despite the low level of commercial discoveries to date, working petroleum systems are known to exist in many of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore basins, as demonstrated by a number of non-commercial discoveries as well as other oil and gas indicators such as hydrocarbon shows in wells.  Nevertheless, the oil and gas potential of the Irish offshore is largely unproven and is likely to remain so until there is a significant and sustained increase in the number of exploration wells being drilled from the current levels of 1 to 2 wells per year.<\/p><p>  To this end my Department encourages exploration investment through an active and targeted promotion campaign, regular licensing rounds and by supporting petroleum research projects that deepen knowledge of the petroleum potential of the Irish offshore.  Maintaining an appropriate fiscal regime is also critical to attracting this much needed exploration investment to Ireland.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s tax terms for oil and gas production are deliberately aimed at attracting new investment and are set at a level comparable to countries such as France, Portugal and Spain, who, like Ireland, have limited petroleum production and with whom we compete for exploration investment.<\/p><p>  The Deputies will be aware that I welcomed the publication by the former Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture of its report on Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration.  The report will contribute to the debate on how best to maximise the benefits to Ireland from the exploration and production of our indigenous oil and gas resources.

There is no price control and it is Government policy to encourage price competition and consumer choice.<\/p><p>  The upward trend in petrol and diesel prices arises primarily from increases in international commodity prices over which Ireland has no control.  For example, the benchmark spot price of a barrel of Brent Crude Oil has risen from an average of US$58 in February 2007 to an average of US$117 in February 2013.  This has inevitably resulted in an increase in retail petrol and diesel prices.<\/p><p>  Previous surveys have shown that prices charged by Irish retailers for oil products relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil.  Prices at the pump reflect volatile market prices, transportation costs, trends in euro\/dollar exchange rates and other operating costs, together with the impact of taxation on oil products.<\/p><p>  The EU Market Observatory publishes an Oil Bulletin with current and historical oil product prices for all EU countries.  As of February 11th 2013, the price of petrol in Ireland was marginally below the EU average; while the price of diesel was 4.8% higher than the EU average.<\/p><p>  If duties and taxes are stripped out then the price of petrol in Ireland was 98.5% of the EU average; and the price of diesel was less than 1% higher than the EU average.<\/p><p>  Against the background of high world oil prices my focus is on measures that will increase the penetration of renewable energy resources in the area of transport.<\/p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme incentivises and enables the sustainable growth of an Irish biofuels market.

Issues such as identifying the most appropriate collection method, exemptions and enforcement mechanics require detailed consideration and all have a bearing on the timeframe for implementation.<\/p><p>  As I have previously indicated to the House, my Department is currently carrying out a Value for Money Policy Review conducted by an independently chaired group on the proposed policy.  I expect to receive a copy of the group&rsquo;s recommendations and report for my consideration by the end of March.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that although subject to a degree of evasion, the existing TV licence fee system has provided a stable funding base for our public service broadcasters.  The rationale for providing State funding for public service broadcasting is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their public service objects while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence.  This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.<\/p><p>  The overall aim of Public Service Broadcasting is to provide services and content which cater for all interests in society, while ensuring that the varied elements of Irish culture and its intrinsic values are protected.<\/p><p>  Through the statutory obligations placed on the Public Service Broadcasters and the criteria set for the funding of content through the Sound &amp; Vision Scheme, which is funded from licence fee revenue, the production of quality indigenous programming and the production of minority interest programming is strongly promoted via the current funding regime.<\/p><p>  Whatever the system of funding, the rationale for providing funding will continue to apply and any changes that may be implemented must continue to provide a secure funding base for public service broadcasting and content.<\/p><p>  It is also important that any changes to the system of funding should take account of the reality of new mechanisms to access such content and services and the pervasiveness of such content in today&rsquo;s society. <\/p><p>  Publicly-funded public service broadcasting and content are now available to everyone on an ever-increasing range of platforms and devices and, in fact, access is not dependent on the ownership of a device.  In short, everyone benefits from the availability of these services, regardless of how content is accessed or relayed to the public, and, therefore, it is my view that the cost should be borne by society as a whole.  This underlines the rationale for a household based broadcasting charge.  I will advance proposals in this regard after receipt of the Value for Money Report, which I referred to earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600053#WRB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Post Office Network","counter":20,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600053#WRB00850"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[9986\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600053#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on the need to maintain a strong rural post office network; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":22,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate An Post is a Commercial State body with its own Board and Management.

The commercial sector is already committed to approximately &euro;1bn investment, which will deliver broadband speeds of 30Mbps to 150Mbps per second to homes and businesses.<\/p><p>  For example:<\/p><p>- Eircom is currently investing up to &euro;500m in a phased deployment of fibre to the cabinet infrastructure, which is planned to make high-speed broadband available to 1.2m premises.  The network has already reached more than 200,000 premises and is expected to be launched in 2013.<\/p><p>- UPC is investing &euro;500m in its cable and fibre network, which is delivering speeds of up to 150Mbps.  UPC aims to have this service available to 700,000 homes by 2015.<\/p><p>- Mobile telecommunications operators will be rolling out advanced mobile broadband products in 2013, following the recent multi-band spectrum auction.  Arising from the huge increase in the use of smart phones and tablet devices, advanced mobile broadband is of increasing significance.  It is expected that fibre connections will be required to service many of the base stations that transmit mobile signals.<\/p><p>  A key element of the Plan is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.<\/p><p>  The Plan also sets out a wide range of actions aimed at supporting and accelerating commercial sector investment in next generation broadband.  It includes measures aimed at stimulating increased rates of digital adoption among citizens and businesses, the removal of barriers to make the various planning and consent approval systems more efficient and cost effective, a review of spectrum policy and legislation, as well as the potential contribution that State entities can make in infrastructure deployment.<\/p><p>  A High Level Group has been established to oversee implementation of the Plan.

Research by Boston Consulting Group cited in the recent UPC report on Ireland&rsquo;s Digital Future, estimates it will grow from a current rate of about 3% of GDP to 6% by 2016.<\/p><p>  Research currently underway in the context of the forthcoming National Digital Strategy will look further at this value and ways it might be enhanced.  That research will be concluded shortly and I propose to publish it in parallel with the National Digital Strategy.<\/p><p>  As Deputies are aware there is substantial employment in Ireland in the ICT and digital sectors arising from the presence of world leading companies in these areas based in Ireland.  In addition, smaller indigenous companies are also making an important contribution.  For example, the Digital Hub currently caters for 66 digital enterprises, which between them, employ some 800 people.  More than three-quarters (78%) of these companies expanded their business operations last year, with 44% hiring additional staff.<\/p><p>  Two-thirds are planning to expand their workforce this year.  In addition the National Digital Research Centre (NDRC) has helped to create 155 full-time jobs and 66 part-time jobs by the end of 2012 as a direct result of the projects it has supported.<\/p><p>  Following on from last year&rsquo;s National Broadband I will shortly publish Phase 1 of a new National Digital Strategy.  This strategy will focus on how we can maximise the benefits of the digital technology that is available to us and will also target approaches to stimulating demand for broadband services and connectivity.<\/p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs published last week contains details of a specific initiative aimed at incentivising Irish micro-enterprises to begin trading online.<\/p><p>  The National Digital Strategy will set out in detail the rationale and overall objectives of this important intervention, which will operate initially on a pilot basis in 2013.<\/p><p>  According to CSO statistics, less than 1 in 4 SMEs in Ireland is trading online. It is not simply that firms should embrace digital to create new jobs; it needs to be done in order to preserve existing ones.  This is what is happening on a global scale and Irish enterprise must keep pace if it is to survive.<\/p><p>  Enhancement of digital skills in our education system and more generally is also of vital importance.  In this context my Department is also working in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills to roll out high speed broadband connectivity to all second level schools.  I believe that this scheme will assist in equipping schools and students with the digital skills, which are so important in a modern society and labour force.<\/p><p>  The commercial sector also has a strong role to play in stimulating demand for Internet services.<\/p><p>  The huge increase in the use of smart phones and tablet devices, increased availability of applications such as video-on-demand, and initiatives by Internet services providers to make technology more accessible to targeted segments of society, will continue to impact on the level of take up.<\/p><p>  As part of the National Digital Strategy, my Department will work closely with the commercial sector to build on these initiatives, with a view to ensuring that citizens, business and communities realise more fully the potential of a digitally enabled society.<\/p><p>  The evidence shows that digital engagement continues to grow steadily &ndash; as evidenced by Ireland&rsquo;s performance in the Digital Agenda for Europe Scoreboard. The most recent EU Scoreboard for Ireland published in 2012 shows 71% of the population are regular internet users &ndash; this is up considerably on the 63% score for the previous year &ndash; and above the EU average of 68%.  The proportion of people who have never used the internet has also noticeably decreased to 21% (from 27% the previous year).<\/p><p>  Deputies will be aware that Ireland has performed extremely well in terms of EU benchmarking of eGovernment services.  Through the eGovernment strategy published last year my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be building on achievements to date to further improve citizens&rsquo; and businesses&rsquo; access to, and experience of eGovernment services.  Attractive online services will also serve as a further driver of internet engagement.<\/p><p>  Deputies will also be aware of my recent appointment of David Puttnam, the distinguished Film Director as Ireland&rsquo;s Digital Champion.  He is strongly committed to the promotion of the digital society.  I am confident that in this role he can contribute significantly to raising awareness levels of the many benefits of digital, particularly in the critical sphere of education and learning.<\/p><p>  Overall the Deputies can be assured of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to proactive promotion of the Digital Economy.  Much progress has already been made in this regard.  The forthcoming publication of the National Digital Strategy will underpin the Government&rsquo;s commitment and signal specific areas for further development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600054#WRC00600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":33,"content":"<p>Question No. 105 answered with Question No. 100.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":34,"content":"<p>Question No. 106 answered with Question No. 104.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alternative Energy Projects","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600054#WRC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[9953\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600054#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will supply an update on plans to make the Belmullet wave test site, County Mayo, operational, including possible joint ventures involving private investment; the priority that he is giving to the project as part of the development of our indigenous wave energy resource and without which we continue to fall behind other countries in research and development and associated jobs in this up and coming energy area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>Wave and tidal energy is still at the RD&D stage globally.

Accordingly, other supports for the sector include the development of the Beaufort Laboratory as part of the IMERC facility in Cork.  This will see a re-housing of the wave tank facility and will bring together researchers in the area currently based in the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre (HMRC) and the Coastal and Marine Research Centre (CMRC).  The whole process is part of a broader campus approach with the Naval College, UCC and Cork Institute of Technology, aimed at maximising on marine industrial opportunities.<\/p><p>  Research in the ocean energy area is ongoing in most universities across the country and ocean energy was recently identified as of 1 of 14 priority research areas by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in their Research Prioritisation Exercise.<\/p><p>  The primary rationale for the Ocean Energy Programme, of which the Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS) in Belmullet is but one component, is to develop and maximise the employment and wealth-generating industry activities that could potentially be associated with ocean energy as it evolves into a fully commercially viable sector. Various studies carried out to date have illustrated that there is considerable potential to create a range of long term jobs and viable indigenous industry.<\/p><p>  Work is continuing in the development of the AMETS facilities off Belmullet and SEAI has been responsible for the co-ordination of the work programme.  SEAI has applied to the Department of Environment for a foreshore lease in respect of the project and is the latter stages of the consenting process.

In preparing the National Renewable Energy Action Plan as required pursuant to the Directive, it was estimated that at least 8.4% of the energy in transport in Ireland in 2020 will come from the use of biofuels with the remainder achieved by the increased deployment of electric vehicles.  In common with other Member States the uptake of electric vehicles is likely to be lower than originally anticipated in the context of 2020 and therefore biofuels will likely be required to play a more significant role in meeting the 10% target.<\/p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme works by obligating large road transport fuel suppliers to bring a certain amount of sustainable biofuels to the market.  The scheme was introduced with an obligation on fuel suppliers to include at least 4% by volume biofuels in their overall disposal of road transport fuels.  In order to maintain progress towards achieving the 2020 targets, I increased the obligation to 6% by volume with effect from 1 January 2013.  It should be noted that strict sustainability criteria must be met in respect of biofuels to be counted under the scheme and towards our renewable energy targets.<\/p><p>  Recently, the European Commission circulated a proposal to amend sections of the Renewable Energy Directive.  This proposal is currently being progressed and is one of the major agenda items for the Irish presidency of the EU.  One of the amendments proposed is that no more than 5% of the energy in the transport sector should come from biofuels produced from certain crops.  My Department is currently examining the proposal and its implications for meeting the target of 10% renewable energy by 2020.  However, there are no implications for the current obligation rate of 6% as the overall energy content delivered by the obligation will not breach the proposed 5%.  The obligation rate of 6% will remain the same until the end of 2014.  Decisions on further increases after 2014 will be taken after any amendments to the Renewable Energy Directive have been finalised.<\/p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation has successfully delivered increased amounts of biofuel in Ireland resulting in 145 million litres being placed on the Irish market in 2011.  Of this, approximately 18.5 million litres was produced indigenously from waste material such as used cooking oil.  Though figures for 2012 are not yet available, I understand that the amount of indigenous biofuel on the market increased last year.  The recent increase in the obligation rate along with future increases will see the biofuel market grow to an estimated 500 million litres by 2020.  This will continue to create opportunities for indigenous industry to produce biofuels here in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600054#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exploration Licences","counter":43,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600054#WRC01900"},{"type":"question","counter":44,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[9978\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600054#WRC02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the amount of money that has been received from companies holding a licencing option in the past three years; if he will provide a breakdown of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1047","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":45,"content":"<p>The monies received from companies holding licensing options in the past 3 years in respect of application and rental fees is a follows:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>2010<\/th><th>&#8364;56,711<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>&#8364;253,586<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>&#8364;453,651<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>&#8364;104,506 (to date)<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>A licensing option may be granted for a period of up to three years.

The commercial sector is already committed to making investments of the order of &euro;1bn which will deliver broadband speeds of 30Mbps to 150Mbps to homes and businesses.<\/p><p>  For example:<\/p><p>-  Eircom is currently investing up to &euro;500m in a phased deployment of fibre to the cabinet infrastructure, which is planned to make high-speed broadband available to 1.2m premises.  The network has already reached more than 230,000 premises and is expected to be launched in the coming months.<\/p><p>-  UPC is investing &euro;500m in its cable and fibre network, which is delivering speeds of up to 150Mbps.  UPC aims to have this service available to 700,000 homes by 2015.<\/p><p>-  Mobile telecommunications operators will be rolling out advanced mobile broadband products in 2013, following the recent multi-band spectrum auction.  With the explosion in the use of smart phones and tablet devices, the use of advanced mobile broadband is of increasing significance and it is expected that fibre connections will be required to service many of the base stations that transmit mobile signals.<\/p><p>  A key element of the National Broadband Plan is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention.<\/p><p>  Earlier this month, my Department launched a tender for experts to assist in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be on-going throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.<\/p><p>  Any contract subsequently awarded to service provider(s) to implement the roll out of broadband in areas which require direct Government intervention will be monitored and measured in terms of performance and quality of service.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business.<\/p><p>  A High Level Group chaired by my Department has been established to oversee progress on a wide range of actions outlined in the Plan aimed at supporting and accelerating investment in next generation broadband.  These include measures aimed at stimulating increased rates of digital adoption among citizens and businesses, the removal of barriers to make the various planning and consent approval systems more efficient and cost effective, a review spectrum policy and legislation, as well as the potential contribution that State entities can make in infrastructure deployment.<\/p><p>  The combination of these actions are designed to ensure that the Government commitment that all parts of Ireland, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600054#WRC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":50,"content":"<p>Question No. 111 answered with Question No. 108.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":51,"content":"<p>Question No. 112 answered with Question No. 98.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postal Services","counter":52,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600054#WRC02800"},{"type":"question","counter":53,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[9892\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600054#WRC02900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding the application by the Thomas Davis Commemoration Society, Mallow, County Cork, to have An Post commemorate the bicentenary of the birth of Thomas Davis by issuing a commemorative stamp in 2014.","asker":"987","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":54,"content":"<p>The Special and Commemorative Stamp Programme for 2014, initially approved by Government on 18 December 2012, did not include a stamp to commemorate the bicentenary of the birth of Thomas Davis.<\/p><p>  Nevertheless, I am pleased to advise that following reconsideration of the strong case made by the Thomas Davis Commemoration Society Mallow, An Post&rsquo;s Philatelic Advisory Committee has now recommended, subject to Government approval, the inclusion of a stamp to commemorate the bicentenary of the birth of Thomas Davis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600054#WRC03000","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mobile Telephony","counter":55,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600054#WRC03100"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[9919\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600054#WRC03200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will report on the recent 4G spectrum sale which netted &euro;855m for the Exchequer and if the process has been fully concluded; if any decision have been made for the ring-fencing of the money generated by the sale for broadband or other communications and energy projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) under the Communications Regulation Act, 2002 as amended.<\/p><p>  ComReg recently announced the winning bidders of its Multi-band Spectrum Auction for the 800, 900 and 1800 MHz bands.<\/p><p>  The winning bidders will pay &euro;854.64 million for these spectrum rights, comprising firstly of Upfront Fees amounting to &euro;481.7 million (adjusted as necessary by transitional arrangements) and secondly, Annual Spectrum Usage Fees in the amount of &euro;372.95 million which will be adjusted for inflation and paid in instalments until July 2030.

To date, these media have not been subject to a formal regulatory regime akin to that used to &lsquo;regulate&rsquo; traditional radio and television broadcast media, either in Ireland or in other jurisdictions.  There is a range of reasons for this, not least the rapidly evolving nature of the technologies involved, the sensitivities around regulating media and the multi-jurisdictional nature of the Internet.<\/p><p>  It is important to acknowledge the economic and social benefits that the widespread use of social media have brought to people, communities and to business.  However, some of the issues that have arisen as a consequence of this bear consideration.  These challenges include dealing with harassment and bullying online, as well as issues around defamation, data protection and even copyright.<\/p><p>  There has been a very considerable amount of discussion on these matters in the recent past at EU and Council of Europe level, in which my Department has been involved.  Indeed this matter is also the subject of a fundamental debate at EU and national level at present, a fact reflected by the recent decision of the Joint Oireachtas Committee to examine the issue.<\/p><p>  As Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I have policy responsibility for providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment to facilitate the development of high quality communications infrastructure and services.  However, I should highlight that I do not have sole responsibility for addressing as to how that infrastructure is used.

In short, everyone benefits from the availability of these services, regardless of how content is accessed or relayed to the public, and, therefore, it is my view that the cost should be borne by society as a whole.<\/p><p>  The replacement of the existing funding system based on the collection of television licence fees with one based on the imposition of device-independent charge on eligible households and businesses is a complex process and the logistics involved require thorough attention.  Issues such as identifying the most appropriate collection method, exemptions and enforcement mechanics require detailed consideration and all have a bearing on the timeframe for implementation.<\/p><p>  My Department is currently carrying out a Value for Money Policy Review conducted by an independently chaired group on the proposed policy.  I expect to receive a copy of the recommendations of the Value for Money Policy Review Group by the end of March.<\/p><p>  Research undertaken prior to the establishment of the Group indicates that charges in other jurisdictions vary, for a variety of reasons, including what the charge is levied on and the method of collection, for example. National characteristics affect the model adopted, making it impossible to compare &lsquo;like for like&rsquo; in terms of fees and charges and also in terms of the conditions attaching to the distribution of funding. I will revert to the Deputy in due course in relation to his specific queries on other jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600054#WRC04600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prospecting Licences","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600054#WRC04700"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[9977\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600054#WRC04800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if companies (details supplied) hold a petroleum prospecting licence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1047","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>The three companies mentioned by the Deputy were awarded onshore Licensing Options in February 2011 for a period of two years from 1 March 2011 to 28 February 2013.

This investment will provide significant choice to the consumer.<\/p><p>  While fibre to the home (FTTH) is currently not widely available to householders in Ireland, broadband networks which are serviced by fibre are increasingly providing high speed services to the home.  For example:<\/p><p>-  Eircom is currently investing up to &euro;500m in a phased deployment of fibre to the cabinet infrastructure, which is planned to make high-speed broadband available to some 1.2m premises by December 2014.  The network has already reached more than 230,000 premises and is expected to be launched over the coming months.<\/p><p>-  UPC is investing &euro;500m in its cable and fibre network, which is delivering speeds of up to 150Mbps to homes and multi dwelling units (MDUs).  UPC aims to have this service available to 700,000 homes by 2015.<\/p><p>-  BT is trialling Fibre to the Cabinet technologies that will deliver broadband at up to 80Mbps.  BT provides this infrastructure to Vodafone and Sky.<\/p><p>-  Mobile telecommunications operators will be rolling out advanced mobile broadband products in 2013, following the recent multi-band spectrum auction.  With the explosion in the use of smart phones and tablet devices, the use of advanced mobile broadband is of increasing significance and it is expected that fibre connections will be required to service many of the base stations that transmit mobile signals.<\/p><p>  Many of these developments were signalled in the Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last.  The commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.<\/p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. <\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business.<\/p><p>  In this context, the Government is committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to in the Plan, to ensure that all parts of Ireland will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600054#WRC06600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hydraulic Fracturing Policy","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":93,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[9975\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRD00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when he expects the Environmental Protection Agency report on hydraulic fracturing to be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[9976\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if any licencing options or exploratory licences will be granted for hydraulic fracturing prior to the publishing on the Environmental Protection Agency report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":95,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 128 together.<\/p><p><br \/>  I have made it clear on a number of occasions that any application for an exploration licence that proposed the use of hydraulic fracturing as part of an unconventional gas exploration programme would be subject to a full environmental impact assessment.

The Galway Bay wave energy test site facilitates the open sea deployment of scaled prototypes of Wave Energy Converters during the early stages of the development of their concept.<\/p><p>  Ancillary power and communications are also available on site. Wave energy devices that have been successfully deployed at the test-site since its inception include Wavebob and the Ocean Energy buoy.  Also incorporated within the test site area is the SmartBay project, run by the Marine Institute. This is a national research infrastructure project for oceanographic monitoring.<\/p><p>  The Galway Bay test site has been co-funded by the Marine Institute and Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland i.e. from state funds. Free access to the Galway site for developers is however available through Marinet.  Marinet is an EC-funded network of research centres and organisations that are working together to accelerate the development of marine renewable energy - wave, tidal and offshore-wind - by offering periods of free access to their world-class testing facilities, standardising testing, coordinating research, providing focused training and industry networking.  Marinet can be accessed by contacting the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre at Beaufort, University College Cork. <\/p><p>  The Ocean Energy Development Unit in SEAI was established to progress the ocean energy sector in Ireland.  SEAI has also been taking forward the development of a full scale grid connected wave test site off Annagh Head, County Mayo. This site is not yet operational.  SEAI has applied to the Department of Environment for a foreshore lease in respect of the project and is in the latter stages of the consenting process.  Additionally a grid connection offer from ESB Networks has been accepted. A comprehensive data collection project to provide wave and seabed information for device developers is also underway.<\/p><p>  The cumulative amount of expenditure on Ocean Energy by SEAI in the period 2009 &ndash; 2013, including the estimated 2013 allocation, is &euro;20.659m.  Some of this funding has also been allocated under a grant scheme for industry known as the Prototype Development Fund.  SEAI has been allocated an ocean energy budget this year and has several current applications from ocean energy companies for funding under this scheme.  Applications are being assessed with a view to the distribution of funds to eligible applicants within the budget available. <\/p><p>  Other supports for the sector include the development of the Beaufort Laboratory as part of the IMERC facility in Cork, which will see a re-housing of the wave tank facility and will bring together researchers in the area currently based in the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre (HMRC) and the Coastal and Marine Research Centre (CMRC), as part of a broader campus approach with the Naval College, UCC and Cork Institute of Technology, aimed at maximising on marine industrial opportunities. <\/p><p>  The Government recognises the potential of our indigenous wave energy resource and the Research and Development and job potential in this area.  In the context of overall reducing budgets, the capital allocation for the Ocean Energy Programme was increased to &euro;5 million for 2013.

Energy is consumed across the transport, heating and electricity sectors.  The intention is to reach Ireland&rsquo;s overall target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable heating and 12% renewable transport, which together amount to 16% of all energy consumption.<\/p><p>  This is set out in our National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) and First Progress Report on the NREAP, which are both available on my Department&rsquo;s website. At end 2011, 6.4% of overall energy consumption from renewable sources had been achieved, so a further increase of 9.6% across the three sectors is required in the years to 2020 if Ireland&rsquo;s target is to be achieved.<\/p><p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) published a report entitled &ldquo;Energy in Ireland&rdquo; in November 2012.  That report gives an estimated figure of approximately &euro;300 million in avoided national gas imports from the use of all renewable energies in the generation of electricity in 2011.  For wind generation alone this would account for approximately an estimated &euro;240 million of the &euro;300 million in avoided gas imports.<\/p><p>  The SEAI Modelling Unit estimate, subject to a variety of assumptions, that fossil fuel dependency in Ireland may be reduced by up to 14% due to the energy efficiency measures and by a further 15% by renewable energy policy in the year 2020.  They have, however, also noted that a significant portion of biofuels and biomass may be imported in that period. <\/p><p>  With regard to potential energy exports, the Memorandum of Understanding on energy cooperation that UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Edward Davey and I signed on 24 January will result in completion of consideration of how Irish renewable energy resources, onshore and offshore, might be developed to the mutual benefit of Ireland and the United Kingdom.  This will determine whether it is beneficial for both countries to enter into an Inter-Governmental Agreement under the Renewable Energy Directive to provide for renewable energy trading.<\/p><p>  If an Inter-Governmental Agreement is entered into, there are potential significant employment opportunities.  As an example, employment creation arising from a 3,000MW project would be expected to be in the order of 3,000 to 6,000 job years in the construction phase, with the actual number dependent on the construction schedule to 2020.  There would also be additional jobs created in the ongoing maintenance of turbines over a 20-year operating life.  Further employment opportunities could arise if turbines or components were to be manufactured in Ireland.  All relevant State agencies, particularly in the enterprise area, would have to coordinate their activities early in the process to ensure employment potential of export projects is maximised.

A resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants will continue to be an important priority for the Government in our ongoing contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  This issue will remain a central feature of the Government&rsquo;s engagement with the US authorities over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period, and my programme and that of other members of the Government, while not yet finalised, will include meetings with key political figures and the Irish community groups that provide assistance to the undocumented. <\/p><p>  The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election.  The emphasis he placed on immigration reform in his inauguration address as well as in subsequent speeches, including the State of the Union address, sent a very positive signal in this regard.  The indications of emerging bipartisan support for reform in Congress is also encouraging.  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system before the shape of any legislative deal is clear.  It is therefore not possible at this stage to identify an exact timescale in which these may become clear but the area will continue to receive the Government&rsquo;s close attention over the period ahead.<\/p><p>  To reinforce the Irish government&rsquo;s interest in the issue I am currently undertaking a round of contacts with key Senators.  Most recently, I spoke with Senator John McCain to express the Government&rsquo;s appreciation for the efforts he and others are making in developing bi-partisan Senate proposals and to underline our ongoing interest in the issue, and with Senator Pat Leahy who is chair of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate.

The camp had been set up by Sahrawi people protesting against their perceived marginalisation, and demanding jobs and adequate housing.   According to reports, eleven members of the security forces and two Sahrawis were killed during the violence.  <\/p><p>Over 200 Sahrawis were subsequently arrested by Moroccan security forces, of whom most were released but 25 were put on trial before the military court in Rabat as a result of their involvement.  On Sunday 17th   February, the military court handed down nine life sentences and sentenced 14 other defendants to between 20-30 years imprisonment each.  Two other defendants were released. It is believed the verdicts will now be appealed to the Moroccan Court of Cassation.  <\/p><p>  The accused have already spent two years in pre-trial detention prison and there have been allegations of torture during their imprisonment.  Concerns have also been expressed regarding the fact that the defendants have been tried in a military rather than a civilian court.  The UN Committee against Torture and the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture has sought to investigate and report on the situation. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has also expressed concerns over the case.  <\/p><p>  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern regarding this case and my officials will continue to closely monitor the situation and the process regarding the appeal of the sentences.  The Government will continue to raise concerns about human rights abuses in Western Sahara, in particular reports of the arbitrary arrest, detention and mistreatment of human rights defenders, with Morocco in our ongoing bilateral dialogue.   Ireland has consistently called for the mandate of MINURSO, the United Nations Mission in Western Sahara monitoring the ceasefire with Western Sahara, to include a human rights monitoring element.  We believe this would provide invaluable independent and impartial information on the status of human rights in Western Sahara.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Language","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRE01325"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[10108\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has had any recent discussions with members of the Northern Ireland Executive in relation to the Irish Language Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":164,"content":"<p>All parties to the Good Friday Agreement recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity, including in Northern Ireland, the Irish language and the languages of the various ethnic communities, as part of the cultural wealth of the island of Ireland.  <\/p><p>  In the St Andrews Agreement, the British Government committed to introducing an Irish Language Act reflecting on the experience of Wales and Ireland and to working with the Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish Language.  <\/p><p>  It also called on the incoming Northern Ireland Executive to work to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language.

Revenue has developed a secure on-line system for filing LPT Returns that is user friendly and easily accessible on the Revenue website.  From the taxpayer&rsquo;s perspective, using the on-line system is the quickest and most straightforward way to complete and submit their LPT Returns, particularly so where there are multiple properties involved, as the system automatically calculates the LPT due for the individual properties, makes it easy to select a payment method from the wide range of options available, and provides immediate access to Revenue&rsquo;s on-line valuation guide.

Accordingly, when the Department publishes the <i>Stability Programme Update<\/i>   in April it will contain official fiscal and macroeconomic forecasts until 2016.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Looking at the fiscal impact of the promissory note deal, there are some aspects of the deal which are yet to be finalised.  For example, the liquidator is in the process of overseeing a valuation and sales process for the assets of IBRC, while the final payments made under the ELG Scheme have not yet been determined.<\/p><p><br \/>  Nevertheless, simulations ran by my Department estimate that the General Government deficit will improve by approximately &#8364;1 billion per annum over the medium term and this should be instructive to the Deputy.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government&#8217;s focus is on stabilising the General Government debt to GDP ratio and beginning the process of reducing it to a lower, safer level over time. The latest official forecast  of General Government Debt was contained in Budget 2013, which projected General Government Debt peaking in 2013 before falling gradually though the forecast horizon.   The debt rule in the Fiscal Compact, which implements the Stability &amp; Growth Pact provisions, requires us to reduce that part of the debt ratio which is above the threshold rate of 60 per cent annually by at least one-twentieth of the difference between the actual rate and the threshold rate.   <\/p><p><br \/>  A transition period will apply for all countries, including Ireland, that are currently subject to the excessive deficit procedure. During this transition period, which would last for three years following the correction of the excessive deficit, the requirement under the debt correction rule is deemed to be fulfilled if we are making &#8220;sufficient progress&#8221; towards compliance. <\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of the fiscal implications of this debt correction rule, it is important to remember that it is the debt to GDP debt ratio that is important, not the overall nominal level of General Government debt. In other words, on the basis of reasonable assumptions over the medium-term, we can expect economic growth to do much of the work in this regard. <\/p><p><br \/>  Obviously, the reduced borrowing requirement over the medium term arising from the promissory note deal will help us to achieve our debt targets more quickly.<\/p><p><br \/>  Additionally, the terms of the Fiscal Compact Treaty require us to converge towards our Medium Term Budgetary Objective once we are out of the EU\/IMF Programme. It should be noted that the MTO is a structural balance target, net of one-offs and cyclical factors. For Ireland, the conversion of our structural budget position into nominal figures is a complex process. It is too early to try and do this in respect of the period 2018-2025 sought by the Deputy. <\/p><p><br \/>  I would emphasise the point that while the agreement on the promissory note is a significant step forward in restoring sustainability to our public finances, this Government is well aware that there remains a considerable gap between what we get in revenue and what we spend. This situation is not sustainable over the longer term. In addition to the requirements to bring our deficit to under 3% of GDP by 2015 as per the EDP, it makes sense that we bring balance back to the public finances and stabilise and reduce our debt burden.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRF03500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banks Recapitalisation","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRF03550"},{"type":"question","counter":221,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[9555\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRF03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the details of all investments made by the State directly or through the National Pensions Reserve Fund in the pillar banks and in Irish Life and Permanent; the current market value of these investments; the estimated value these investments will have in 2018 based on the projected performance of the banks and presuming no sale of these investments in the meantime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":222,"content":"<p>The bank recapitalisation commitments made by the State to date are set out in the following table:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Government preference Shares (2009) - NPRF<\/th><th>3.5<\/th><th>3.5*<\/th><th>-<\/th><th>-<\/th><th>7.0<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Capital contributions (with Promissory Notes as consideration) \/Special Investment Shares (2010) &#8211; Exchequer **<\/td><td>0.9<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>30.7<\/td><td>31.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ordinary Share Capital (2009) &#8211; Exchequer<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>4.0<\/td><td>4.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ordinary Share Capital (2010) - NPRF<\/td><td>3.7<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>3.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total pre-PCAR 2011 (A)<\/td><td>8.1<\/td><td>3.5<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>34.7<\/td><td>46.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Capital from Exchequer***<\/td><td>3.9<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>4.0<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>7.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NPRF Capital <\/td><td>8.8<\/td><td>1.2<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>10.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total PCAR (B)<\/td><td>12.7<\/td><td>1.2<\/td><td>4.0<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>17.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Cost of Recap for State (A) + (B)<\/td><td>20.7<\/td><td>4.7<\/td><td>4.0<\/td><td>34.7<\/td><td>64.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>* &#8364;1.7bn of BoI&#8217;s government preference shares were converted to equity in May\/June 2010 (&#8364;1.8bn still left in existence).

One of the proposals is on the monitoring and assessment of draft budgetary plans and on ensuring the correction of excessive deficits. The other is on the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance and sets out explicit rules for enhanced surveillance of countries experiencing or threatened with financial difficulties.<b><font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font><\/b>The agreement reached on 20 February will have to be approved by member countries and the European Parliament. The &quot;two-pack&quot; will be a significant and welcome enhancement of the euro area&#8217;s economic governance regime. It is, to a great extent, a natural extension of the measures contained in the &#8216;six-pack&#8217; which was introduced on 13 December, 2011. The &#8216;six-pack&#8217; - comprising five regulations and one directive - reformed and strengthened fiscal surveillance under the <i>Stability and Growth Pact<\/i>   and introduced new macroeconomic surveillance. <\/p><p><br \/>  The &#8216;two-pack&#8217; is applicable to euro area member countries only. <\/p><p><br \/>  The proposed surveillance regulation provides for surveillance under a number of circumstances, specifically, where a member state is experiencing severe difficulties with regard to its financial stability and where this is likely to have adverse spillover effect on other Member States, where a member state is in a macroeconomic adjustment programme, and also post-programme surveillance. There are specific features attaching to each of these.  However, in the case of enhanced surveillance, it is a matter for the Commission to decide every six months whether to prolong the enhanced surveillance.  Under the regulation, a post-programme surveillance process will be put in place and maintained for a member country until the balance outstanding under EU-sourced financial assistance falls below 25% of the total. This covers all EU funding sources, including bilateral loans.  It also provides that the Commission shall conduct, in liaison with the ECB, regular review missions in the Member State under post-programme surveillance to assess its economic, fiscal and financial situation. <\/p><p>The reports generated following such missions shall be considered by the European Council which - acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission - may recommend to the Member State concerned to adopt corrective measures.  The regulation provides that the duration of post-programme surveillance may be extended by the Council on a proposal from the Commission <i>&#8220;in the case of persistent risks to the financial or fiscal sustainability of the Member State concerned.<\/i>   Post-programme surveillance is a normal feature of IMF assistance programmes, and this regulation provides for a similar arrangement for the EU.  <\/p><p>The other proposed regulation concerns <i>&#8216;the monitoring and assessment of draft budgetary plans and on ensuring the correction of excessive deficits&#8217;<\/i>   in euro area Member States. It will apply to all countries in the euro area, with special provisions including in relation to reporting requirements being made for those which are subject to an excessive deficit procedure.   This draft regulation specifies that all euro area Member States, not in a macroeconomic adjustment programme, will be required to submit to the Commission and the Eurogroup and make public a draft budgetary plan no later than 15 October each year.  The draft budgetary plan will be assessed by the Commission, which shall adopt an opinion on it by the end of November.  The draft regulation also provides that the Commission may request a revised draft budgetary plan in exceptional circumstances where it identifies particularly serious non-compliance with the budgetary obligations laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact.<\/p><p><br \/>  This Government is firmly committed to reducing the deficit to below 3% by 2015 and to achieve a structural balance thereafter in line with the stability treaty.  These regulations make no changes to these rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRH02700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Collection","counter":324,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRH02750"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[10115\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRH02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if it is his intention that the property tax will be payable in instalments using various mediums such as An Post, the banks, the credit union and PayPal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"990","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":326,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that commencing in March 2013 residential property owners will receive their Local Property Tax (LPT) Return from Revenue together with an LPT booklet, which will provide details of the payment options available to pay the tax.

Under the provisions of the Act, endowment mortgage savings plans must be reviewed by the life company at least every five years to check if the plan is on track to repay the mortgage. A statement setting out the estimated revised valuation of the endowment policy at maturity must be issued by the insurer to the borrower.

In addition to the payment of the local authority grant, two other conditions must be met, to qualify for the reduction.  Firstly, the person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  Secondly, the liable person in relation to the property must notify the Revenue Commissioners in writing of the amount of the chargeable value that is attributable to the adaptation along with any relevant documentation.  The reduction in value is limited to the lesser of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  This chargeable value is to be used in relation to subsequent valuations of the property, unless additional grant-aided work is carried out.  The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property that has been adapted, unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property.

In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption will only apply where the cost of the adaptations exceeds 25% of the chargeable value of the property before it is adapted.

It comprises of a Chairperson and six ordinary members, all appointed in their individual capacities based on their knowledge and expertise.<\/p><p>  The membership of the Appeals Board is as follows:-<\/p><p>  Ms. Maureen Waldron, Chairperson, former Director in the Department of Social Protection; Mr. P&aacute;draic McNamara (vice-Chair), former Chief Executive Officer of the State Examinations Commission; Dr. Marie Clarke, Lecturer, School of Education at UCD; Ms. Rebecca Murphy, former Student Union Welfare Officer, University College Cork; Ms. Eithne Frost, Consultant in the Voluntary Sector; Ms. Brenna Clarke, retired Professor of English at St. Patrick's College of Education; Professor Kevin Ryan, former Registrar of the University of Limerick.<\/p><p>  Prior to an applicant making an appeal to the Appeals Board, an initial appeal in writing to the relevant awarding authority is provided for under the Student Support Act 2011.  This provides for a review of the decision by an appeals officer of the grant awarding authority, independently of the original assessment process.  If, after this initial appeal, the grant applicant still remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his\/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.  The Appeals Board is fully independent in the performance of its functions.  The inaugural sitting of the Appeals Board took place on 7th October 2011.  Since that date the Appeals Board has sat on 20 occasions over a 16 month period to consider appeals.  Appeals are received on an on-going basis throughout an academic year.  Since its establishment, the Appeals Board sittings have taken place at intervals varying from 2 to 4 weeks: the frequency of sittings is determined by the volume of appeals submitted and the requirement that the Appeals Board make a determination on the appeal within the 60 day timeframe specified in the Student Support Act 2011.<\/p><p>  Since its establishment in 2011, the following amounts have issued to the Appeals Board members:-<\/p><p>- Allowances - &euro;15,450.00;<\/p><p>- Travel and Subsistence - &euro;6,591.61.

Also in 2009, the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Acts of 2009 abolished the payment of long service increments (LSIs) to members from the formation of the current Oireachtas.  As LSIs are no longer payable, current Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad will not have LSIs included in their pension calculations, regardless of whether or not they had been at one time in receipt of those increments.<\/p><p>  Under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010, a further reduction in pay was imposed on the remuneration of members of the then Cabinet.  This Government itself imposed a policy of strong pay reduction and restraint since taking office in March 2011 with the pay of all members of the Government voluntarily reduced from its first day in Office.  Section 6 (c) of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Act, 2011 provided the legislative basis for these pay reductions from 1 January 2012.  The effect of these reductions is that the gross annual salary of An Taoiseach has been reduced by nearly 30% since December 2009, and that of the T&aacute;naiste and Ministers by nearly 25% from December 2009, excluding the impact of the pension related deduction.<\/p><p>  In relation to allowances in the nature of pay, following reductions and abolitions by the previous Government to a number of allowances related to Committees, the system of allowances paid to Members was substantially overhauled by this Government in 2011 upon taking office.  The rate of allowances paid to Chairpersons of Oireachtas Committees and to Commission Members were reduced further, representing reductions in the region of 50% on the June 2009 rates.  The total estimated cost of the current measures in respect of these allowances is now less than &euro;400,000, compared to a cost in 2008 of &euro;1.436 million.<\/p><p>  In the context of the Expenditure Estimates for 2013, I announced that a 10% reduction will be applied to the Party Leaders&rsquo; Allowance rates payable to qualifying leaders of political parties and to qualifying independent members.  I also announced that severance payments payable to Ministers and other Officeholders upon cessation of Office are to be abolished.  My Department has already commenced preparations on the changes to primary legislation necessary to effect those changes.<\/p><p>  Prior to the introduction of the new Parliamentary Standard Allowance expenses regime from 1 March 2010, the previous expenses regime had been reduced by 10%, except for mileage which had been reduced by 25% in the case of mileage. <\/p><p>  Since 1 May 2011, Cabinet Ministers with the exception of Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Law Reform now use their own cars on official business.  Ministers of State have used their own cars on official business since 1984.

In this regard, I would refer the Deputy to my reply on this issue (PQ 3066\/13 - answered 23\/01\/13).<\/p><p>  The inclusion of a social clause in all public procurement contracts requiring that a quota young unemployed people or long-term unemployed be employed in the delivery of the contract poses a number of risks. Firstly, it is against EU Treaty principles to discriminate between people on the basis of age. Secondly, in the current economic climate, and in particular bearing in mind the difficulties in the construction sector, businesses have for obvious reasons been reducing their existing workforce rather than taking on new employees. Consequently, it would be expected that, where a business is awarded a public contract, the work would be carried out by the existing employees of that business. In such circumstances a social clause requiring that a number of long-term unemployed be employed in delivering a public contract could either impose an additional cost on SMEs that they may not be able to afford, or result in an employee of the supplier being let go in favour of a long-term unemployed person. <\/p><p>  The Government has a wide range of measures that it is deploying to facilitate job creation and support labour activation, with particular emphasis on assisting long term unemployed people.  Obviously, the main purpose of the public procurement process is to ensure that goods, services and works are purchased by the State in a manner that is legal, transparent and of high probity, and our key requirement is the achievement of value for money.  Within this context, my Department and the National Procurement Service are examining the use of social clauses as an additional means of supporting activation and we are seeking to identify the scope for the use of social clauses in parts of the capital area in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRM00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":550,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRM00950"},{"type":"question","counter":551,"qnumday":295,"qnumall":"[3971\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he has met the social partners since this round of talks has commenced on the Croke Park agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":552,"content":"<p>I met representatives of the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in December last regarding the commencement of discussions with public service management on a new agenda for reductions in the cost of delivering public services and substantial longer term productivity improvements and workplace reforms. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, I attended a plenary meeting of the parties yesterday at which the Labour Relations Commission presented proposals after intensive discussions over the weekend.

Under the CER, multi-annual current expenditure ceilings are fixed for each Department in order to make clear, in advance, the resources available for each area and the level of savings required. The intention of this reform measure is to improve the focus on medium-term, structural and strategic planning of expenditure within each area and to prevent spending overruns where possible. <\/p><p>  Good progress has been made to advance reforms in the area of evidence-based expenditure policy. This includes actions taken in relation to the Public Spending Code to consolidate existing procedures in this area and modernise them in line with best national and international practice. These reforms are supported by the establishment of a Public Service Evaluation Network, reforms to the Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review process and the introduction of new Focused Policy Assessments designed to answer specific issues of policy configuration and delivery.<\/p><p>  With regard to the specific areas referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) are key enablers to delivering improved public services. In 2012, my Department published the eGovernment Strategy 2012-2015 and the Cloud Commuting Strategy, which identified necessary actions to enhance the delivery of public services using ICT. While these strategies were developed by my Department in conjunction with the Public Service Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council, the specific responsibility for implementation of actions arising from these strategies and for assessing the efficiencies that arise, including enhancing ICT capability, is a matter for each individual Department and Office.<\/p><p>  The Reform Plan has given an added impetus to the OPW&rsquo;s on-going drive to reduce rental outgoings.  Through a programme of lease surrenders and rent reviews, The OPW has reduced the annual rental cost of Civil Service accommodation by approximately &euro;25 million. The Reform Plan has been given further support by a specific Government decision mandating the OPW to further rationalise Civil Service accommodation and produce more space efficient accommodation standards. This will facilitate the surrender of the maximum feasible number of leases as lease breaks arise thus further reducing the Government's rental costs. As part of this process, the OPW has been asked to work with the various sectors within the Public Service, e.g., Local Authorities, HSE, etc., to develop standards and protocols that will facilitate the sharing of buildings and the transfer of property, thus reducing the State's overall property costs.<\/p><p>  A decision-making model for Shared Services has been established to evaluate value for money to the taxpayer for all Shared Services programmes under my Department&rsquo;s remit. A cost-benefit analysis to assess the potential efficiencies that a Shared Services Centre can deliver, of both pay and non-payroll expenditure, is carried out in respect of each proposed Shared Service programme. This analysis is assessed with comparable benchmarks elsewhere to identify the opportunity for improving cost efficiencies and effectiveness for a specific function. These make up a significant part of the overall business case. The business case also considers a number of possible options and assesses the financial and non-financial value of each of those options. Each Shared Service programme has a business case submitted for peer review to the Shared Service Transformation Unit and the Central Economic Evaluation Unit (for evaluation of the financial and non-financial assumptions against the Public Spending Code). <\/p><p>  The methodology I have described above allows me to report that the Human Resources and Pensions Shared Services Centre for the Civil Service, PeoplePoint, is expected to yield combined pay and non-pay savings in the region of an annual net saving of &euro;12.5 million by 2014 while the number of staff involved in delivering these services will reduce by a minimum of 17%. The first transitions to PeoplePoint are expected at the end of March 2013, with all 40 in scope bodies to be transitioned by the end of 2014. A similar approach has been taken to develop a business case for Payroll Shared Services and to assess the baseline performance of Banking and Financial Management for consideration for Shared Services. A cost-benefit analysis for Shared Services projects notified to my Department is also being undertaken across the Public Service sectors of Health and Local Government.<\/p><p>  I would also point out that the Progress Reports published by the Implementation Body overseeing progress on the Public Service Agreement have identified significant non-pay administrative efficiency savings. Two reports have been issued to date &ndash; the first in June 2011 and the second in June 2012. <\/p><p>  Overall, good progress has been made on delivering savings and implementing the Public Service Reform Plan. Of course, it remains a matter for each Minister and their Departments to ensure that the Vote-level allocations are adhered to and at the same time ensure that they continue to provide essential front-line services and respond to increasing demands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRM01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Funding","counter":563,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRM01850"},{"type":"question","counter":564,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[10327\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRM01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when he will provide funding or to have work undertaken to deal with flooding problems caused by the River Reane in the Fenagh area near Ballinamore, County Leitrim; if his attention has been drawn to the concerns of the local community in relation to the damage caused by recent flooding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":565,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works recently approved funding of &euro;10,000 under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp; Coastal Protection Scheme to Leitrim County Council to carry out a feasibility study to assess the flooding problem at River Reane at Tully Lough in the Fenagh area.

Following consideration of the consultation responses, a draft Operational Programme for PEACE IV will be prepared and a further public consultation on the draft Programme will be held in early to mid 2013.<\/p><p>  It is intended that both Operational Programmes for PEACE IV and INTERREG V will be presented to the Northern Ireland Executive, the Irish Government and the Scottish Government during 2013.  Formal submission to the European Commission for approval will take place following agreement of the three Governments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":570,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRM02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":569,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRM02250"},{"type":"question","counter":570,"qnumday":302,"qnumall":"[9619\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRM02300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if any Government Departments are planning to be involved in 2013 EU funding under the competitiveness and innovation programme and seventh framework programme; the calls for pre-commercial procurement grants open at present; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"978","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":571,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s researchers and companies have been involved in more than 1,500 successful applications obtaining European Commission funding of approximately &euro;485 million (2007-2012) under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7).  The overall Irish success rate at 22.7%, is above the European Member State average of 22.1%, and a very positive indication of the prospects for Irish participation over the lifetime of FP7 and broadly in line with our national targets.   Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in the 2013 work programme is expected to reflect participation to date, i.e. demonstrating an application success rate above the EU average. <\/p><p>  In July 2012, the European Commission launched its final and largest ever package of FP7 calls, an &euro;8.1 billion work programme for 2013.  This work programme is currently underway, with closing dates for proposals spanning September 2012 to year end 2013. Funding will be awarded in 2013 &ndash; 2014.   <\/p><p>  The limited budget attached to the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) means that it is not an expenditure-orientated programme like FP7 or the Cohesion Policy Funds, but one that seeks to achieve its ambitions and broadly defined objects by leveraging its ideas, products and partnerships into other policies and programmes. Enterprise Ireland will be engaging with CIP funding for 2013 through the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) which is the primary instrument for the CIP programme.  As suitable calls arise, the EEN will be engaging with its client base.   One very concrete benefit to Ireland and SMEs from this programme is its joint funding of the Enterprise Europe Network, which is in the region of &euro;450,000 per year.<\/p><p>  In relation to Pre-Commercial Procurement,  there is Irish involvement in two pilot programmes in the CIP ICT Policy Support Programme. These pilot programmes mainly address interoperability of public service pilots on a large scale across Europe, with the ultimate objective of wide-scale service uptake eventually by all 27 member states.  Under this year&rsquo;s 2013 call for this work programme, PPI (Public Procurement of Innovative solutions) instruments will be used for the first time, in anticipation of their wide-scale use in Horizon 2020 to fund innovation procurement.<\/p><p>  While there has been no Irish participation to date in FP7 ICT PCP projects, there are some PCP topics within the current ICT call and there is evidence of some interest by Irish academia in exploring the feasibility of involvement with a PCP in the technology-enhanced learning area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRM02400","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Issues","counter":572,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRM02450"},{"type":"question","counter":573,"qnumday":303,"qnumall":"[10253\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRM02500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if the Cabinet Committee on Job Creation has investigated the jobs crisis in County Kerry; if it will request the Industrial Development Agency to prioritise County Kerry for jobs investment in view of the fact that the county lost Objective 1 Status in 1998 and the fact that the three nearest counties have fared exceptionally better with IDA site visits, County Cork 31, County Limerick 13 and County Clare six; if he and the Cabinet Committee on Job Creation will request the IDA to give the county the jobs boost it so urgently requires; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":574,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[10277\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRM02600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of jobs announced by the Industrial Development Agency and Enterprise Ireland for County Kerry in each of the following years, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":575,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 303 and 315 together. <\/p><p>  I have been informed by IDA Ireland that, in the five year period 2008 to 2012, there were three IDA job announcements for County Kerry with the potential to create 155 jobs. During the same period, there were two Enterprise Ireland investment announcements with the potential to create 41 jobs and nine High Potential Start Up (HPSU) projects announced for county Kerry.  For reasons of commercial sensitivity, it is not possible to give details of the job potential of these HPSU projects.  <\/p><p>  At the end of 2012 there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry employing 1,600 people, while Enterprise Ireland had 132 client companies in the county employing 3,318 people. <\/p><p>  In relation to the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to County Kerry, IDA Ireland has indicated that the challenge it faces is to continue to win top quality investment for Ireland in a very challenging global environment. International competition for FDI has become extremely intense and continues to increase.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world class physical and digital infrastructure as well as the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  IDA Ireland, however, tries to influence these choices by prioritising the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass with sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services, etc. and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, an FDI project secured for one Gateway can have a positive impact on other Gateways and their surrounding areas. It must be acknowledged, however, that the decision on where a client company will locate a new FDI investment is ultimately made by the senior managers of the companies involved.<\/p><p>  I am mindful of the concerns that have been expressed by Deputies on all sides of the House about the relatively low level of site visits to certain regional locations and have raised this matter with the CEO of IDA Ireland with a view to exploring what further initiatives can be taken to influence potential investors to invest in such locations. <\/p><p>  I am mindful, also, that in order to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for foreign direct investment, it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014, when IDA Ireland&rsquo;s current strategy is implemented. This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development. <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding these challenges, IDA Ireland has assured me that it will in 2013, in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, seek to target more than 130 new investments, secure &euro;500 million of R&amp;D expenditure and create 13,000 new jobs in its client companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRM02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consumer Protection","counter":576,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRM02750"},{"type":"question","counter":577,"qnumday":304,"qnumall":"[9635\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRM02800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the charges that can be applied to flights when booked by credit card; and if he will legislate to ban such practices.","asker":"959","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":578,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s consultation paper of September 2012 on Article 19 (Fees for the use of means of payment) and Article 22 (Additional payments) of Directive 2011\/83\/EU on Consumer Right gives details of payment charges applied by a number of traders, including the charges applied by airlines referred to by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  Article 52(3) of Directive 2007\/64\/EC on Payment Services in the Internal Market states that a &lsquo;payment service provider shall not prevent the payee from requesting a charge or from offering a reduction for the use of a given payment instrument.&rsquo; Article 52(3) gave Member States discretion to &lsquo;forbid or limit the right to request charges taking into account the need to encourage competition and forbid the use of efficient payment instruments&rsquo;.

This initiative examined every role in the organisation for the purpose of highlighting operational changes that could be implemented to enhance delivery of key objectives; identifying areas of duplication that could be addressed by improved processes; as well as identifying areas where there was scope to introduce enhanced IT systems, thus giving the agency greater flexibility to relocate staff to client facing functions.<\/p><p>  Following that process, I understand that IDA Ireland retains two offices in the North East Region &ndash; an office in Cavan, with one full time role concentrating on client facing activities and an office in Dundalk, with one client facing role and one part time support role.

While the Comprehensive Expenditure Review, 2012 to 2014, published in December 2011, provided for a reduction of a further &euro;540 million in expenditure by my Department in 2013, the Government was able to reduce the net savings required for this year to &euro;390 million.  This was &euro;150 million less than originally indicated.  This enabled the Government to ensure, for the second year in a row, that there was no reduction in primary weekly rates of payment.<\/p><p>  In 2013, the Department will spend almost &euro;20.3 billion on the wide range of schemes and services it operates.  Carers receive significant income supports from the Department, among the highest rates of income support in Europe.  Carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care), and the annual respite care grant in respect of each person for whom they care.  Such an annual payment, in a single lump sum with no requirement to satisfy a means test, is not available for any other group nor is there an equivalent payment for carers in any other country in Europe.  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their main social welfare payment and get the half-rate carer's allowance as well.  They can also receive an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person.<\/p><p>  The current rate of the respite care grant (&euro;1,375) remains significantly higher, and still more than double what it was in 2002 (&euro;635).  Expenditure on the grant has increased by 290% since 2005 from &euro;34.3 million to &euro;135 million in 2012.<\/p><p>  In relation to the next budget, the Deputy will be aware that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Expenditure Report 2013 published by Government last December provides for additional new expenditure reduction measures of &euro;440 million to be achieved in 2014 in the Department of Social Protection budget.  Reducing overall expenditure in 2014 in line with this target will be very challenging.  No decisions have been made at this stage as to how these targets will be met.

To this end and to ensure that the Advisory Group&rsquo;s report is considered within the broader public debate on this issue, the report will be considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRP00400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Applications","counter":698,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRP00500"},{"type":"question","counter":699,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[9992\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRP00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an application for domiciliary care allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny and if she will expedite same.","asker":"965","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":700,"content":"<p>An application for domiciliary care allowance was received on the 24th April 2012.

The sustainability of the pension system is a particular concern because of the demographic challenges Ireland faces, the associated increases in pension (and other age related) costs, and the deterioration in the public finances.  This means that, in the future, the task of financing increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population as demographic projections indicate the ratio of working age to older people will decrease from 5.3 to 1 at present to 2.1 to 1 by 2060.  Life expectancy in Ireland is also increasing and whilst this is very welcome development, it also presents very real and obvious public policy challenges. <\/p><p>  Discussions on long term pension policy identified the need for a short and focussed examination on the direction of policy to ensure a modern, sustainable, and adequate pension system taking into account the impact of the economic downturn.  It was in this regard that the OECD was commissioned to review long term pension policy in Ireland.  <\/p><p>  The particular aspects being considered by the OECD include:<\/p><p>- the sustainability of the pension system in the light of demographic and investment challenges;<\/p><p>- the adequacy and coverage levels, in order to ensure adequate income in retirement with a particular focus on the lower and middle income group;<\/p><p>- the modernity of pension systems to ensure flexibility in the labour market and supporting mechanisms for longer working;<\/p><p>- equity within the pension system.<\/p><p>  The review was initiated in April 2012. Since then, the OECD has engaged extensively with a range of Government departments, the social partners, older groups and representatives from the pensions industry.  A consultation forum including a wide range of stakeholders was held in Farmleigh House in September 2012. <\/p><p>  It is anticipated that the final OECD report, which will be used to inform government decisions in this area, will be presented to me in the coming weeks.

IFI actively promotes the potential of our inland fisheries resource, and on its establishment in 2010, set up a Business Development Division to further develop the potential of the inland fisheries sector with a special interest in promoting the tourism potential of the sector. IFI also works with Tourism Ireland to promote angling tourism.<\/p><p>  The following promotional activities are undertaken by IFI on a routine basis:<\/p><p>- Daily updates to the www.fishinginireland.info website with the latest information for anglers.  In 2012 80,000 referrals were made via the IFI website. Frequent updates to FACEBOOK and Twitter. FACEBOOK currently provides a reach to 750,000 individuals.<\/p><p>- Weekly publication and circulation of the IFI online magazine Angling Ezine in providing information on the best angling available in Ireland to a very wide group.<\/p><p>- Up to 15 Trade Shows are attended by IFI annually in Ireland, UK, Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and the US promoting Ireland as a prime angling tourism destination. <\/p><p>  In addition, IFI has produced a number of new angling guides, maps and leaflets, reprinted a number of guides and produced high quality promotional material. The most recent of these published are: <\/p><p>- Mayo Game Angling Guide<\/p><p>- Sligo Game Angling Guide<\/p><p>- Boyne Valley Angling Guide<\/p><p>- Lough O&rsquo;Flynn &amp; River Suck Angling Guide<\/p><p>- South West Angling Guide<\/p><p>  Guides are produced in hard copy and electronically and a number are available in French and or German. Staff in IFI support visiting angling journalists, up to 30 a year, in promoting the best of Irish angling through various articles and blogs in Irish, UK, European and US Press. <\/p><p>  In 2012 IFI commissioned a major survey of recreational angling in Ireland.  This important research focuses on domestic and overseas anglers, fish species of interest, estimates of expenditure and other data with a view to improving the quality of angling and to benchmark the Irish angling experience against competitor destinations. <\/p><p>  In addition IFI will shortly launch a revamped website and an angling App which will provide information on angling resources nationwide.  IFI also operates a pilot sponsorship programme and a large variety of events have been sponsored including major competitions such as the World Pairs, The Rosslare Small Boats Competition, The Dutch King of Clubs and the upcoming World Youth Fly Fishing Championship.  These events bring hundreds of visitors to Ireland. <\/p><p>  In addition to these direct measures, IFI is working with my Department on a major project to modernise, consolidate and simplify the law pertaining to inland fisheries, which is well advanced and which will serve the sector well into the future.  The review of legislation will go to public consultation in the near future.  A key overriding objective of this project is to put in place the legislative basis to allow IFI to develop the potential of the sector, mainly by increasing the number of anglers utilising the resource, empowering stakeholders to take an active role in the development of the resource and to maximise the returns from the inland fisheries resource to local communities and the State. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR00300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gas Exploration","counter":815,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR00350"},{"type":"question","counter":816,"qnumday":391,"qnumall":"[9735\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the latest reports and findings on unconventional gas exploration and extraction in Germany of November 2012 and the presentation given by Mr Helmut Fehr, Kreis Steinfurt, to local groups in County Leitrim last month in relation to the district of Steinfurt in Germany who have decided to meet the challenges related to the rising costs of energy and the upcoming shortage of fossil fuels and if he will outline from the information provided whether he would integrate this material into any further investigation of the Irish research (details supplied)","asker":"1082","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":817,"qnumday":392,"qnumall":"[9736\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR00500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he proposes to explore the regional economic impact of hydrofracking and gas production here using the German model (details supplied) and the way his Department will deal with each issue raised.","asker":"1082","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":818,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 391 and 392 together.<\/p><p>  I understand that on 4th February, 2012, German politician and scientific advisor Helmut Fehr presented a talk at a public meeting in Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, on how fracking might affect rural areas.<\/p><p>  I understand that amongst other views, he expressed his belief that the Environmental Protection Agency should have the last word on whether fracking goes ahead and that its German counterpart is due to release a comprehensive report in November of this year.

Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis can be found on the website of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) at www.callcosts.ie.<\/p><p>  The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.<\/p><p>  The State only becomes involved in the provision of services in instances of clear market failure, such as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS).  My Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS.  The Scheme offers a basic broadband service, in line with EU State aid clearance, to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated Electoral Divisions.  In County Mayo, NBS services are available within 112 of its 154 Electoral Divisions.  The general area of Kilmovee was excluded from the NBS since at the time of mapping exercise carried out prior to the launch of the Scheme it was found to be served.  The NBS is prohibited under State Aid and competition rules from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.<\/p><p>  The RBS was launched in 2011 in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision.  This Scheme was aimed at making a basic broadband service available to un-served premises in rural areas, not already covered by the NBS.  Commercial service providers were in a position to offer services to all applicants from County Mayo under the Scheme who agreed to engage with them.<\/p><p>  In addition to consumer services, State-funded Metropolitan Area Networks which provide high capacity fibre connectivity for businesses and telecoms operators in the regions are located in Ballina, Ballinrobe, Belmullet, Claremorris, Kiltimagh and Knock in County Mayo.<\/p><p>  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013, and the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>  Specifically, it commits to:<\/p><p>- 70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015,<\/p><p>- At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population, and <\/p><p>- A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.<\/p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. <\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.<\/p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including County Mayo, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR00800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Transmission Network","counter":822,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR00850"},{"type":"question","counter":823,"qnumday":394,"qnumall":"[9807\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR00900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide details of any future plans by EirGrid to construct high-capacity transmission lines in western Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":824,"content":"<p>EirGrid&rsquo;s Grid25 programme is a strategy designed to develop the transmission networks in order to ensure safe, secure and affordable electricity supplies throughout Ireland supporting economic growth, renewable and sustainable energy.  The Government endorses this major investment programme currently underway in the high voltage electricity transmission system.  Grid25 is the most important investment in Ireland&rsquo;s transmission system for several generations and will position our energy system for decades to come.<\/p><p>  The transmission system in Ireland, managed and operated by EirGrid, consists of three voltage levels of high capacity lines.  It is operated at 400 kV, 220 kV and 110 kV.<\/p><p>  In 2012 significant progress was made in a number of Grid25 regions in relation to construction, uprating and refurbishment of over 200km of existing circuits and there is currently 2000 megawatts of wind power installed on the Island of Ireland.<\/p><p>  Significant progress has been made on the Grid West project since it was launched in May 2012 and extensive public consultation has occurred over the last 9 months.  The project will be moving to a key stage in the coming weeks with the publication of the Stage 1 Report which will indicate a number of potential corridors that can accommodate this new transmission line following all the information on the study area gathered today. EirGrid is encouraging anyone with an interest in the project to participate in the upcoming consultation. <\/p><p>  The Grid West project will initially consist of a new high capacity power line, but based on the region&rsquo;s renewable potential, it is envisaged that in time, a second line will be required.  The pace of installation of the second line is dependent on a number of factors including the speed at which further renewable energy generation is developed in the region. <\/p><p>  EirGrid is also developing a West Galway project consisting of a new 110kV electricity substation to allow renewable generation to connect to the transmission grid. The project calls for a new electrical substation to connect into a planned 110kV distribution line running from Salthill to Screeb, County Galway.  The project will increase security of energy supply to the region and enable Galway to be a net exporter of renewable energy.

Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis can be found on the website of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) at www.callcosts.ie.  Decisions by Eircom relating to investment in infrastructure to provide broadband services, including the upgrading of local exchanges, are taken purely on commercial grounds and as such are not one in which I have a statutory role.<\/p><p>  The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.<\/p><p>  The State only becomes involved in the provision of services in instances of clear market failure, such as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS).  My Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS.  The Scheme offers a basic broadband service, in line with EU State aid clearance, to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated Electoral Divisions.  In County Clare, NBS services are available within 49 of its 155 Electoral Divisions, including the general area of Lissycasey.  Fixed residences and businesses in the area can therefore apply for a broadband connection from &ldquo;3&rdquo; under the NBS.  Lissycasey is not covered under the RBS which was aimed at making a basic broadband service available to un-served premises in rural areas, not already covered by the NBS.<\/p><p>  In addition to consumer services, a State-funded Metropolitan Area Network which provides high capacity fibre connectivity for businesses and telecoms operators is located in Kilrush in County Clare.<\/p><p>  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013, and the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>  Specifically, it commits to:<\/p><p>- 70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015,<\/p><p>- At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population, and<\/p><p>- A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.<\/p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. <\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.<\/p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including County Clare, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR01300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Transmission Network","counter":829,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR01350"},{"type":"question","counter":830,"qnumday":400,"qnumall":"[9879\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if there are any plans for the development of an electricity interconnector between Ireland and mainland Europe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1092","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":831,"content":"<p>Security of energy supply is a key imperative for Ireland and the European Union.

In Ireland and across Europe, the digital economy is considered to be a key enabler for stability, jobs, growth and social inclusion.  For this reason, as chair of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council, I have prioritised a number of initiatives that support the implementation of the Digital Single Market and the Digital Agenda for Europe.<\/p><p>  An important goal in this regard is to progress the legislative proposal for a pan-European electronic ID, authentication and signature framework.  This is a key enabler for a properly functioning EU digital market.  The proposed regulation is technically complex and Ireland aims to comprehensively address the many important concerns raised by Member States during its Presidency with a view to producing a comprehensive Progress Report for Council next June.<\/p><p>  In tandem with this initiative, Ireland has prioritised the delivery of measures to enhance trust in online services.  Trust and security in online transactions is essential so that both consumers and businesses can make secure, simple and inexpensive online transactions.  As Presidency, Ireland is therefore seeking to deliver real progress on the recently published proposals for a comprehensive EU Cyber Security Strategy as well as legislation relating to network and information security.<\/p><p>  These cyber security proposals will build on earlier initiatives to enhance trust and security. Earlier this month, the Irish Presidency negotiated the first agreement under the Irish Presidency on a renewed mandate for the workings of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA).<\/p><p>  The rollout of advanced high speed broadband is a key priority across Europe and another important pillar of the Digital Agenda for Europe. In Ireland, we have published a National Broadband Plan which aims to deliver early on some of the key targets under the Digital Agenda for Europe.  As Presidency we await with interest, proposals from the Commission in relation to reducing the cost of high speed broadband rollout which we believe will resonate with some of the actions identified in Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, and on which we hope to commence dialogue during our Presidency. <\/p><p>  All of these initiatives are designed to improve and encourage access for citizens, communities and business, thus enabling a more digitally empowered society and creating opportunities for growth.  The proposed Directive on the Re-use of Public Sector Information, is aimed at creating such opportunities and Ireland hopes to shortly conclude an agreement with the European Parliament on this issue.  The Directive allows for increased availability of public sector information which can be re-used for commercial and non-commercial purposes.<\/p><p>  Making information more widely accessible across society is also a key objective and under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency, the Council has started examining legislative proposals on the accessibility of public sector websites.<\/p><p>  The recent MFF negotiations significantly impacted on the financial envelope available to the telecoms element of the Connecting Europe Facility.  The telecoms Working Party will consider the most appropriate way forward on this initiative once the vote of the European Parliament on the budget is known.<\/p><p>  Finally, the Digital Agenda Assembly will be held in Dublin next June.  My officials are working closely with the Commission to shape the event which will emphasise digital skills and entrepreneurship.  The theme of the event will be heavily influenced by the recently published mid-term review of the Digital Agenda which highlighted the fact that ICT can contribute to a paradigm shift in society and economic activity through more efficiency, new products and services and smarter public services.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR02500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies","counter":847,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR02525"},{"type":"question","counter":848,"qnumday":406,"qnumall":"[10161\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR02600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide details of the payment of bonuses or other performance related payments and or allowances made to the staff of agencies under the aegis of his Department with a yearly breakdown from 2008 outlining the overall amount paid in each year period and the number of staff that received such payments and or allowances.","asker":"1001","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":849,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[10178\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR02700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide details of payments made to the CEO or equivalent of all agencies under the aegis of his Department including details of any bonuses, pension entitlements or any other remuneration paid to him or her in 2012.","asker":"1001","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":850,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 406 and 407 together. <\/p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the information sought regarding payments made to CEOs and staff in the agencies under the aegis of my Department is an operational matter for each Agency.<\/p><p>  All directions issued by the Government in relation to remuneration of CEOs in Semi State Companies have been brought to the attention of the relevant State Companies.<\/p><p>  In so far as the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to staff subordinate to the CEO, these are matters solely for the agency in question. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR02800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Radio Broadcasting","counter":851,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR02850"},{"type":"question","counter":852,"qnumday":408,"qnumall":"[10262\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR02900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to deal with the following situation, seven out of ten minutes of listening time in Ireland is given to the 34 private radio stations here and at the same time taxpayer's money only goes to our national broadcasters, the JNLR figures show that 2.5 million listeners listen to independent radio stations whereas 1.2 million listen to our national stations, the action he will take to deal with this anomaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":853,"content":"<p>As I have stated previously in this House, I fully recognise the contribution of the independent radio sector in bringing diversity to the airwaves, and serving the needs of communities, often at a very local level.

Moreover, in many cases, their success in the licence application process was assisted by the voluntary commitments they gave in regard to the provision of public service type content, over and above that required by the relevant legislation.  The licences were accepted in full knowledge of the current system of public funding.  The fact that some of these stations are now undergoing an understandable degree of financial stress does not mean that the State should immediately step in and provide funding &ndash; they are and remain commercial enterprises.<\/p><p>  Moreover, it should also be noted that their very popularity in the communities they serve is, in many cases, as a distinct result of the local news content and current affairs type programming that they provide and which, in turn, gives them a strong advertising presence and thus earning potential.<\/p><p>  The rationale for providing State funding for the Public Service Broadcasters is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their public service objects while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence.  This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.<\/p><p>  The overall aim of Public Service Broadcasting is to provide services and content which cater for all interests in society, while ensuring that the varied elements of Irish culture and its intrinsic values are protected.  Through the obligations placed on the Public Service Broadcasters, which are established in legislation passed by the Oireachtas, and the criteria set for the funding of content through the Sound &amp; Vision Scheme, the production of quality indigenous programming and the production of minority interest programming is strongly promoted.<\/p><p>  I am, of course, willing to consider proposals from other broadcasting organisations in relation to the future distribution of funding.

In line with its legislative obligations, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is currently undertaking a review of the adequacy or otherwise of the public funding provided to the public service broadcasters.  In this context, I have asked the BAI to consider as part of this review the potential impacts to these broadcasters if television licence receipts were further distributed to the independent broadcasting sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR03000","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Provision","counter":854,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR03050"},{"type":"question","counter":855,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[10267\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR03100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the reason his Department&rsquo;s website is misleading in relation to the delivering of broadband to certain parts of County Longford, as it states that broadband is available in areas where in fact, it is not; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":856,"content":"<p>In terms of telecommunications policy, my Department plays a key role in providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment within which competition can flourish and private sector investment can take place.

Ireland is now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband in Ireland which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.<\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  This will ensure that citizens or businesses, wherever they are located, have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business in a global digital environment.<\/p><p>I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to in the Plan, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including County Longford, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR03200","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Prices","counter":857,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR03250"},{"type":"question","counter":858,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[10329\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR03300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which directly or in consultation with the regulator, he and or his Department continues to monitor the prices charged by oil companies for petrol and diesel; if the current prices charged reflect a reduction in accordance with the fall in oil prices on world markets over the past four years; if any reason has been given for relatively high prices now being charged at filling stations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":859,"qnumday":411,"qnumall":"[10330\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR03400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if any discussions have taken place, directly or at EU level, with a view to ensuring that oil price reductions on world markets are passed on to the consumer with particular reference to the need to lower energy costs, as a prelude to economic recovery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":860,"qnumday":412,"qnumall":"[10331\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR03500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which comparisons have been made between energy prices here and those applicable in Europe and worldwide with a view to ensuring that the domestic and industrial consumer here can avail of lower international oil prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":861,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 410 to 412, inclusive, together. <\/p><p>  Neither I nor the Commission for Energy Regulation have a statutory function in the monitoring or regulation of petrol and diesel prices. <\/p><p>  The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and de-regulated and there is free entry to the market.  There is no price control and it is Government policy to encourage price competition and consumer choice. <\/p><p>  The upward trend in petrol and diesel prices arises primarily from increases in international commodity prices over which Ireland has no control.  For example, the benchmark spot price of a barrel of Brent Crude Oil has risen from an average of US$43 in February 2009 to an average of US$117 in February 2013.  This has inevitably resulted in an increase in retail petrol and diesel prices.<\/p><p>  Previous surveys have shown that prices charged by Irish retailers for oil products relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil.  Prices at the pump reflect volatile market prices, transportation costs, trends in euro\/dollar exchange rates and other operating costs, together with the impact of taxation on oil products.<\/p><p>  The EU Market Observatory publishes an Oil Bulletin with current and historical oil product prices for all EU countries.<\/p><p>  As of February 11th 2013, the price of petrol in Ireland was marginally below the EU average; while the price of diesel was 4.8% higher than the EU average.<\/p><p>  If duties and taxes are stripped out then the price of petrol in Ireland was 98.5% of the EU average; and the price of diesel was less than 1% higher than the EU average.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about high oil prices are shared at EU level and fellow Member Countries of the International Energy Agency (IEA).  The EU and IEA agree that high fossil fuel prices, which pose a threat to economic recovery, underline the need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels by radically enhanced energy efficiency measures and the development of renewable energy.<\/p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme incentivises and enables the sustainable growth of an Irish biofuels market. The Scheme currently requires that the amount of biofuel brought to the market is not less than 6.38% of petroleum road transport fuels.  In 2011 some 145 million litres of biofuel were brought to the Irish market.<\/p><p>  The development of electric vehicles offers potential for Ireland to use cheaper grid sourced electricity, an increasing amount of which is sourced from renewable resources.<\/p><p>These opportunities will progressively reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels for transport, while supporting energy competitiveness and security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRR03600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Provision","counter":863,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRS00250"},{"type":"question","counter":864,"qnumday":413,"qnumall":"[10332\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRS00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which standard, quality and speed of broadband here currently compares with the best available worldwide; his plans to maximise this country's position in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":865,"content":"<p>There has been significant growth in the take up of broadband services and contracted speeds in Ireland in recent years.  The most recent telecommunications data report by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), reveals that the number of broadband subscribers has more than doubled to over 1.6 million between 2007 and  2012.  Similarly, in the case of speeds, the number of residential customers contracted in a range between 2 &ndash; 10 Mbps  increased from 41% of all subscribers in 2007 to 71% in 2012. The number of subscribers accessing speeds exceeding 10 Mbps increased from 0.2% to 24%.<\/p><p>  EU and international comparisons of broadband services are complex to measure and interpret. For example, OECD surveys calculate an average of all advertised broadband speeds. The average speed reduces if there is a significant choice of products advertised at these lower speeds. In addition OECD calculations do not differentiate between services that are available nationally and services which are available in selected areas. Similarly, EU Commission statistics published on its digital scoreboard website, compare advertised versus actual speeds and are based on 2011 data. Comparisons between countries do not take account of distinct geographical and demographic challenges that face countries such as Ireland where the population is highly dispersed. <\/p><p>  EU Commission statistics, published on its digital scoreboard website, which compare advertised broadband speeds across the EU notes that  84% of subscribers in Ireland access speeds in a range between 2-10 Mbps compared to the EU average of 87% in this range.  In the case of speeds at or exceeding 10 Mbps, the EU Commission reports 29% availability over fixed lines in Ireland compared to an EU average of 48%. In the most recently available OECD data, Ireland&rsquo;s penetration is ranked 13th in terms of wireless connections and 25th   in terms of fixed line connections. The average speed reported by OECD for Ireland is 23 Mbps compared to an OECD average closer to 45 Mbps. Other international studies rank Ireland well in terms of actual speeds experienced by users. <\/p><p>  The more recent ComReg report notes an overall trend of customers contracting at higher speeds.  The proportion of customers contracting at or below 2 Mbps fell from 7% - to 5% of all subscriptions between 2011 and 2012. Increasingly, subscribers are contracting at speeds in excess of 10Mbps. <\/p><p>  Recent market developments are dramatically changing the landscape of high speed broadband provision in Ireland. During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The commercial sector is already committed to investments of the order of some &euro;1bn and is accelerating its investment to deliver broadband speeds of 30Mbps to 150Mbps to homes and businesses.  For example:<\/p><p>- Eircom is currently investing up to &euro;500m in a phased deployment of fibre to the cabinet infrastructure, which is planned to make high-speed broadband available to some 1.2m premises.  The network has already reached more than 230,000 premises and is expected to be launched over the coming months;<\/p><p>- UPC is investing &euro;500m in its cable and fibre network, which is delivering speeds of up to 150Mbps.  UPC aims to have this service available to 700,000 homes by 2015;<\/p><p>- Mobile telecommunications operators will be rolling out advanced mobile broadband products in 2013, following the recent multi-band spectrum auction. <\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.

It is the case however, that Ireland in the main, is at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices which dictate the retail price of electricity and gas, which is the key factor in the retail price of both electricity and gas. In particular, Ireland is a price taker for gas.  Global gas and oil prices have risen sharply since the start of 2011 driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan and demand from emerging economies of China and India.  There are clear indications that international oil and gas prices will rise further over the coming months.  The Government remains firmly committed to increasing competition as the best means of exerting downward pressure on energy prices, and also towards ensuring diversity of energy supply to reduce our exposure to high and volatile external energy prices.  This dependence on imported gas also underlines the need to promote and invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency.<\/p><p>  Effective procurement of energy services can also lead to significant organisational savings. My Department is working closely with private and public stakeholders on a National Energy Performance Contracting Policy Framework (the Framework) to help companies procure energy-related services including energy efficiency retrofits, energy supply and behavioural improvements. Recent experience from programmes run by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland demonstrates the substantial monetary benefits that good procurement can deliver. I expect to be in a position to publish the draft Framework within the next two months.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s demand for gas is met almost entirely by imports across the gas interconnectors from Great Britain.  The vast bulk of UK gas demand is currently being met by indigenous North Sea production and imports from Norway.  Through the gas interconnectors Ireland has access to diverse sources of supply including UK indigenous production, Norwegian production and physical interconnection with mainland Europe.  It is prudent, in light of Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on gas imported from the UK, to work to reduce our reliance on this source.  Bringing Corrib gas production on stream will further reduce our reliance on imports. <\/p><p>  The European Commission recognises that Europe needs an internal energy market that is competitive and integrated with electricity and gas flowing where and when it is needed.  The EU aims to fully integrate national energy markets to give consumers and businesses more and better products and services, more competition, and more secure supplies.  In this regard I welcome the recent progress made on the SEM Market Integration Project, within the context that implementing the European Target Model is a positive development that will bring significant benefits to the consumers and producers of electricity on the island of Ireland.  Of course actual physical cross border trading of electricity is only possibe to the extent that interconnectors can accommodate it and accordingly I welcome the recent completion of construction by EirGrid of the East West Interconnector(EWIC) a strategically vital infrastructure project.<\/p><p>  I presided, last Friday, over the European Energy Council as part of Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency and among the issues on the agenda was the Commission Communication on completion of the Internal Energy Market.

Indeed this matter is also the subject of a fundamental debate at EU and national level at present, a fact reflected by the recent decision of the Joint Oireachtas Committee to examine the issue.<\/p><p>  As Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I have policy responsibility for providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment to facilitate the development of high quality communications infrastructure and services.  However, I should highlight that I do not have sole responsibility for addressing as to how that infrastructure is used.  Responsibility, in the context of abuse over the Internet in particular, also sits with the Minister for Justice and Equality, and the executive agency of his Department, the Office for Internet Safety.<\/p><p>  It is clear that there are no simple answers to the challenges posed by the development and abuse of social media, not least because of the international basis of the services and because any possible policy responses fall across a range of Government Departments.  In recognition of this complexity my Department maintains open and regular contact with all Departments and State Agencies with responsibilities in this area.<\/p><p>  My Department also monitors international developments with a view to ensuring that domestic policy within its remit reflects best practice and that the regulatory framework is amended as necessary. In that regard, I look forward to the deliberations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications, and I also look forward to meeting the Committee on this subject.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRS01600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postal Services","counter":884,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRS01650"},{"type":"question","counter":885,"qnumday":420,"qnumall":"[10341\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRS01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent, if any, to which he continues to have contact with An Post with a view to ensuring the maintenance of the post office and services network and next day delivery throughout the country without exception; if alternative, complementary and or compatible services such as banking continue to be attracted by An Post with a view to ensuring its long term viability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":886,"content":"<p>Operational matters in relation to the post office network are a matter for the management and Board of An Post and one in which I have no statutory function.<\/p><p>  As shareholder, however, I have a strong concern in relation to the ongoing commercial position of the Company and I regularly liaise with the Company in this regard.<\/p><p>  An Post has many strengths and has the largest retail presence in the country.

This was a historic meeting as it marked the first under new universal membership arrangements for UNEP agreed in &quot;The Future We Want&quot; document at the Rio +20 Conference held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in June 2012. Environment nisters attending the Session backed decisions designed to ensure a strengthened and upgraded institution that will be able to meet the environmental challenges of the 21st century. This  was the first major restructuring of UNEP since it was founded four decades ago. The negotiations in Nairobi were challenging, particularly in relation to the new institutional arrangements and it fell to the Irish Presidency to coordinate the EU&#8217;s input to these negotiations. <\/p><p>The Irish Presidency team&#8217;s co-ordination role involved managing multiple parallel tracks of meetings and participating in a number of bi-lateral meetings with other non-EU delegations during the Session.  Following agreement on all the major decisions tabled, the Irish Presidency on behalf of the EU and its Member States welcomed the outcome of the Session. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Ministerial segment took place over the first three days of the Session during which I and fellow nisters discussed a range of issues including the key priority of Institutional Reform of UNEP, Sustainable Development Goals, and the Green Economy . In addition, the Governing Council took a number of other decisions across a range of themes including on sustainable consumption and production, green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, chemicals and waste and UNEP&#8217;s Programme of Work and Budget. Further details on the negotiations and outcomes of the meeting are available at <i><i>.<\/i><\/i><i><\/i>On the eve of the Governing Council I addressed a High Level international meeting on the Rule of Law and the Environment which brought together nisters of the Environment and Government representatives with representatives of the judicial, legal and auditing professions.   <\/p><p><br \/>  I attended and spoke at round table discussions on emerging policy issues in the area of the environment and also attended lunchtime discussions, hosted by the Executive Director of UNEP, Mr. Achim Steiner, on the Green Economy. I also outlined, in my Presidency role, key EU priorities and concerns on the institutional arrangements for UNEP being discussed at the Session. In addition, I attended and spoke on behalf of the EU at a Ministerial Breakfast hosted by the German nistry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, for key players in the negotiations. I also attended a reception hosted by the Head of the EU delegation in Nairobi at which Sustainable Development Goals were discussed.   <\/p><p><br \/>  While at the Governing Council I also took the opportunity to have a number of bilateral meetings. I met with the Executive Director of UNEP to discuss a number of issues including the key issues before the Session, Ireland&#8217;s Presidency of the EU in the context of the Informal Environment Council which takes place in Dublin on 22\/23 April next and issues relating to the GEMS Water Programme, which is the primary source for global water quality data and information. I had further discussions on this latter issue with UNEP at official level. <\/p><p><br \/>  I also met with Mr. Richard Beynon, the UK Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Natural Environment, Water and Rural Affairs, during which we discussed priorities for Ireland&#8217;s Presidency of the EU. I also met with Mr. Janez Potocnik, EU Commissioner for the Environment, to review EU priorities and the state of play in negotiations during the Governing Council and co-chaired, with Commissioner Potocnik, a meeting with representatives of major groups and civil society. During the negotiations, I also chaired two meetings of EU nisters and Heads of Delegations to agree EU priorities as discussions moved into a critical phase. Commissioner Potocnik and I also took the opportunity to meet, on a bilateral basis, with Environment Ministers from a number of Latin American countries - Columbia, Mexico, Bolivia and Brazil - to discuss key issues during the Session, principally in relation to sustainable development goals, the green economy and resource efficiency. <\/p><p><br \/>  In the margins of the Governing Council, and in accordance with normal practice, I attended a reception hosted by Ireland&#8217;s Honorary Consul at which I met members of the Irish Community in Kenya and Irish officials from UNEP involved in preparations for the 27th session.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRT00800","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Control of Dogs","counter":937,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRT00825"},{"type":"question","counter":938,"qnumday":438,"qnumall":"[9693\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRT00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide an update on recent contact with farming representatives regarding the promotion of responsible dog ownership, particularly in order to reduce the level of sheep worrying taking place in rural areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":939,"content":"<p>Both I and my Department met recently with representatives of the Irish Farming Association as part of on-going discussions regarding dog control issues in general and instances of sheep worrying in particular.<\/p><p>  As a direct result of these discussions both my Department and the Irish Farmers Association issued press releases regarding the spate of serious dog attacks on sheep which occurred earlier in the year.

Under section 10 of the Act, a fire authority is required to make provision for the delivery of fire services in its functional area, including the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of premises. <\/p><p>  The embargo on the filling of posts in the Local Government Service was introduced on 24 March 2009 following a Government Decision to implement savings measures across the wider public service.   <\/p><p>  My Department received a delegated sanction from the Department of Finance in August 2009 for implementation of this general moratorium on the filling of public sector posts across all local authorities.   <\/p><p>  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each County and City Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible. In this regard, it is a matter for County and City managers, in the first instance, to ensure that the reduction in staff numbers is managed so that the appropriate service level is maintained within budgetary and staffing constraints.   <\/p><p>  Where vacancies arise, local authorities must consider all options for reorganisation and reallocation of work to meet requirements.\u00a0 Any exceptions to the moratorium require sanction from my Department. <\/p><p>  All staffing sanction requests are examined on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services and the need further to reduce overall staffing levels in the local authority sector. My Department works closely with local authorities to ensure that key posts are filled.

In determining an application for the opening of an insolvency proceeding, for which it would have exclusive power as the primary proceedings, of a company or of a natural person, the Regulation requires that a court should determine the centre of main interest (COMI) of the applicant in the context of  assuming jurisdiction.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is a matter for the court to satisfy itself that the provisions in its national law in this regard have been observed.  For example, the UK Courts can and have refused or revoked insolvency proceedings where an abuse has been detected. Indeed, this has occurred with certain individuals, who were subsequently subject to insolvency proceedings in this jurisdiction. <\/p><p><br \/>  A company or natural person is entitled to change a COMI and could do so for the purposes, <i>inter-alia<\/i>   of taking advantage of more favourable insolvency legislation. This entitlement arises under the broad rubric of freedom of movement in the Internal Market and such freedom has been enforced by decisions of the European Court of Justice. The country in which the debts are incurred is not necessarily material, but the relocation must not be artificial. The question of COMI is determined at the date the application for the insolvency proceeding is made and not at the time the debts were incurred. Orders made in insolvency proceedings in another EU jurisdiction, including an order discharging a person from bankruptcy, are enforceable against creditors elsewhere in the EU. <\/p><p><br \/>  In response to the economic downturn across Europe, the EU has published a proposal to modernise cross-border insolvency law which seeks to make cross-border insolvency proceedings more efficient, benefiting both debtors and creditors throughout the EU.  One of the primary aims of the new Regulation will be to give potentially viable companies and entrepreneurs a second chance before being declared insolvent. The proposal also addresses a range of other insolvency issues. <\/p><p><br \/>  I arranged that the initial discussion on the proposed Regulation took place at the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting of EU Justice Ministers held in Dublin Castle on the 17 and 18 of January last. The Ministers, including my British colleague, engaged in a very detailed and constructive discussion on the proposals contained in the Regulation. I emphasised the importance of a more uniform approach across the EU in regard to the establishment of the centre of main interest so as to combat potential abuses in this regard which have given rise to allegations of &quot;bankruptcy tourism&quot;. <\/p><p><br \/>  Detailed consideration of the provisions contained in the new draft Regulation has now  commenced in a Working Group chaired by the Irish Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRV02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tribunals of Inquiry","counter":1070,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRV02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1071,"qnumday":488,"qnumall":"[9768\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRV02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 153 of 12 December 2012, the progress made on the recommendations of the Moriarty Tribunal;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1072,"content":"<p>As stated in my reply on 12 December 2012, insofar as the report of the Moriarty Tribunal made recommendations concerning the future operation of tribunals of inquiry, many of these recommendations are anticipated by the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005 which awaits Report Stage debate in the D&aacute;il.

The Board prioritises certain categories of cases and these cases will receive an immediate or near immediate service.  The main categories of case types that are prioritised are public law child care cases, child abduction cases and domestic violence cases.  In addition, the Board has been piloting a triage approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in a number of law centres.  The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times.  The aim of the triage approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes).  If the applicant requires further services they remain on the waiting list.  There is or has been a backlog of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Board is taking other steps in an effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery including introducing a new case management system in its law centres, integrating its mediation and legal services, integrating its Refugee Legal Service into the general law centre service delivery model and maintaining a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court.  The reality is that the Board must live within its budget and is subject to the public service recruitment moratorium (there is a very limited derogation).  Demand for the Board's services has increased significantly since the downturn in the economy.  There was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011.  However, demand in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006.  The capacity to provide a meaningful service is a priority for the Board.  In 2013, the Board will examine other options in an effort to enable legal services to be provided promptly to those most in need of them.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to Criminal Legal Aid, total expenditure for 2012 came to &#8364;50.5 million, a reduction of 10% over the 2011 figure of &#8364;56.1 million.  This reduction in the annual expenditure is the largest ever recorded and represents a fall of approximately &#8364;10 million, or 16%, over the peak recorded in 2009.  As the Scheme is demand led it is difficult to predict and control expenditure because it depends on the number of criminal cases coming before the courts.  The Task Force on Cost Reductions on Criminal Legal Aid identified a range of measures which could potentially contribute to costs reductions in this area.  As I stated in the Topical Issues debate referred to in the Deputy's question, a requirement on applicants to make an initial payment could give rise to constitutional difficulties and difficulties arising from the European Convention on Human Rights.  It would not be feasible to introduce arrangements which give rise to further administrative expense and demands on resources for no real benefit.  A new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is planned to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, <i>inter alia<\/i>, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions must have regard to a person's rights to the presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to be given legal aid, where appropriate.  I hope it will be possible to publish the Bill during the course of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRW01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service","counter":1093,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRW01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1094,"qnumday":495,"qnumall":"[9910\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRW01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the total amount spent on outsourced security services in the Court Services for 2012; and if he will provide details of the companies providing these services.","asker":"1032","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":1095,"qnumday":496,"qnumall":"[9911\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRW01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the total amount spent on outsourced cleaning services in the Court Services for 2012; and if he will provide details of the companies providing these services.; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1032","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1096,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 495 and 496 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions, including the provision and maintenance of accommodation for court sittings.

All States operate immigration controls for well established reasons of public policy, including considerations of an economic nature which in the case of Ireland remains extremely challenging with ongoing high levels of unemployment. There are also considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account.<\/p><p>  Legal and illegal migration are two sides of the same coin and a balanced policy needs to facilitate regular migration channels while at the same time take action against immigration abuse.  Many people from overseas have made Ireland their home in recent years.  In this context it is worth noting that many of the EU citizens who arrived here during times of economic prosperity have chosen to remain notwithstanding the change in economic circumstances.  In addition, many individuals have been granted citizenship in recent years.  Over the past two years alone, approximately 38,000 individuals have successfully applied for and been successful in their citizenship applications, approximately 13,000 in 2011 and approximately 25,000 in 2012. <\/p><p>  Of course, citizenship is not the only means of attaining lawful residence in the State.  For example, through an accrual of employment permits an individual may choose to apply for long term residence, or to continue to renew his or her status on an annual basis. Tens of thousands of immigrants have remained on in the State on foot of such provisions.<\/p><p>  Clearly, all illegal immigrant cases are not the same and must be dealt with on a case by case basis and on the basis of their individual circumstances.  At one end of the scale are those where the person's illegal status is through no fault of their own and indeed my Department has been dealing with cases of this nature on an ongoing basis.  However there are also much more egregious instances of immigration abuse, often at considerable expense to the State and it does not follow that such persons should profit from their conduct. <\/p><p>  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.<\/p><p>  In looking at cases as they arise, among the issues that would be relevant to the outcome would be the circumstances in which the person became undocumented, the length of time they have been in that situation, their prospects of being able to gain lawful employment without being a drain on the financial resources of the State along with the more general considerations applicable to immigration decisions, including any family related rights they may have in the context of the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p><p>  Sometimes case by case consideration will result in a positive outcome for the applicant.  However, in other cases this may result in a decision by the Irish authorities, subject to the oversight of our Courts, that the person has to go home.  That decision should be respected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRX01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Offences","counter":1127,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRX01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1128,"qnumday":507,"qnumall":"[10043\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRX01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of holders of category W driving licences that have been convicted for towing a trailer on a work vehicle or land tractor in each of the years 2010, 2011 and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1129,"content":"<p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.

It is a matter for the court to satisfy itself that the provisions in its national law in this regard have been observed. For example, the UK Courts can and have refused or revoked insolvency proceedings where an abuse has been detected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRX02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Aid Service Expenditure","counter":1148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRX02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1149,"qnumday":514,"qnumall":"[10124\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRX02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the amount of funding that was given to Free Legal Aid for the periods 2010, 2011 and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1150,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that my Department made available the sum of &euro;98,000 to the Free Legal Advice Centres (FLAC) in each of the years 2010, 2011 and 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRX03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sentencing Policy","counter":1151,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRX03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1152,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[10132\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRX03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans for establishing sentencing guidelines; if he intends to set up a sentencing council; the discussions he has held with the LRC on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1153,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that judges are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  In accordance with this principle, the role of the Oireachtas has been to specify in law a maximum penalty and a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.<\/p><p>  There are, of course, a small number of situations where statute has created exceptions to this approach most notably by providing for mandatory sentences for murder and presumptive minimum sentences in the case of certain firearms and drug trafficking offences.  Except for exceptional circumstances, I am of the view that the Oireachtas should be cautious in prescribing mandatory sentences.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient. The Law Reform Commission is currently examining the law in relation to mandatory sentences and I understand that this work will be completed this year.<\/p><p>  It would not be in keeping with the principles of judicial independence for the Executive to impose a Sentencing Council on the Judiciary. For similar reasons, the Deputy may be aware that the Law Reform Commission, after detailed study some years ago, recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines but favoured non-statutory sentencing principles.  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  Information on over 1,000 cases is detailed on the website and I welcome the committee's recent announcement that two JobBridge interns are to be appointed shortly in order to recommence populating the online database with information on sentencing in the criminal courts. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that the ISIS committee announced they are planning to recommence providing information on sentencing in relation to specific issues in which context an analysis has been published on rape sentencing prepared by the Judicial Researchers Office under the guidance of Mr. Justice Peter Charleton.  I understand that seminars are also planned, including one focusing on the work of the Sentencing Council in the UK.<\/p><p>Finally, in September 2012, I announced a strategic review of penal policy. I have established a working group to carry out this review which will examine all aspects of penal policy and I expect the Group to report later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRX03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport","counter":1154,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRX03250"},{"type":"question","counter":1155,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[10139\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRX03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 129 of 7 February 2013, of the 31 patrol vehicles allocated to the Tipperary Division if he will provide a breakdown by district of the number of these cars that are operated by the Traffic Corps within their division; the number that are used solely for patrol purposes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1156,"content":"<p>Decisions in relation to the provision and deployment of Garda transport are matters for the Garda Commissioner.

These proposals also draw heavily from the regulatory and practise models of England and Wales which do not always correspond to those of our jurisdiction nor to those set out under current Government policy in the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011.  Under Section 30 of the Bill, provision is already made for public consultation in relation to the creation of a new profession of conveyancer.

It is one of 6 Fishery Harbour Centres operated by the State, each of whose primary purpose is to provide facilities and services for the fishing industry and fisheries-related activities.  <\/p><p>  There has been significant capital investment in the Fishery Harbour Centres in recent years, underpinning both the fisheries side and, in parallel, their expanding use for leisure and marine tourism and other maritime enterprises.  Howth in particular has a long tradition in both areas.  All of the users of the Fishery Harbour need to be accommodated in a safe and secure facility, and the Department has a duty of care towards anyone entering it.  Apart from any other considerations, the upkeep of the Harbour so that it meets with current health and safety standards has a cost and this cost must be paid for out of the income generated. <\/p><p>  In the current economic climate, the State must be fully committed to maximising the return on its investment.  Furthermore, my Department is required to ensure that the Fishery Harbour Centres are run on a financially sound basis.  <\/p><p>  With over 500 parking spaces within the boundaries of the Fishery Harbour Centre at present, it is clear that a significant source of revenue exists that could assist in balancing the books, and providing funding for enhancements that would not otherwise be possible.<\/p><p>  I am reviewing all aspects of the matter at present.  I can assure the Deputy that the views of the various harbour users, the potential earnings, the possible impact on the harbour businesses and recreational users, the impact on the local economy, the impact on overall traffic management within the Fishery Harbour, are all matters that I will take into account in coming to a decision. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRZ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Afforestation Programme","counter":1267,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRZ02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1268,"qnumday":559,"qnumall":"[9640\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRZ03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding an afforestation application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1269,"content":"<p>The application for pre-planting approval submitted by the person named is located within a Special Protection Area (SPA) designated for the protection of the hen harrier.

Up to that point there was no basis for any action.  My Department was requested on 21st   December by the FSAI to obtain samples of raw ingredients in the context of the FSAI survey on the authenticity of meat products, preliminary results of which indicated traces of non-bovine DNA.

I would point out, however, that the Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to enact legislation to regulate certain practices in the grocery goods sector.  The Government intends to give effect to this commitment by including an enabling provision in the legislation currently being prepared to merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, which will allow for the introduction of a statutory Code of Practice.  Work on drafting the Consumer and Competition Bill is on-going and the Bill is included in the &ldquo;A list&rdquo; in the Government&rsquo;s current Legislative Programme.  It is important to point out that in introducing a statutory Code the intention is not to protect one stakeholder over another nor is the Code intended to prevent stakeholders such as retailers and suppliers from engaging in the type of contractual negotiations that happen in most other sectors of the economy.  It is also the case that the Code is not seeking in any way to determine the price of grocery goods. Rather, the essential value of the Code is that by regulating problematic practices in the grocery goods sector it seeks to strike a fair balance between the competing interests of the various stakeholders including the interests of the end user, the consumer.<\/p><p>  The Government is strongly of the view that it important to ensure there is balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector and that Ireland continues to have strong agri food and retail sectors, particularly given the importance of these sectors to the national economy.  The introduction of a Code of Practice, as provided for in the Programme for Government, is intended to achieve such a balance taking into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector.  It must also be noted, however, that arrangements in the domestic market are not the primary influence on farmers&rsquo; incomes.  Unsurprisingly, with an Agri-Food industry that exported over &euro;9bn of goods last year, the bulk of most Irish farmers&rsquo; produce is exported (e.g. 4 out of 5 beef cattle produced in Ireland are consumed in other countries), so EU and world prices have a much bigger influence on the price farmers receive for their output overall than does the retail price in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRAA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":1307,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRAA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1308,"qnumday":572,"qnumall":"[9710\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRAA01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when the agri environment options scheme 1 payment will be made available to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1309,"content":"<p>The person named was approved for participation in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme with effect from the 1st September 2010 and full payments totalling &euro;608.11 and &euro;4,195.14 issued in respect of 2010 and 2011 respectively.

An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is working to address this issue, particularly as oil prices increase and the cost of sending trawlers full of fish to Spain, France, Scotland and Norway becomes less economical.  With the increase in the Blue whiting quota for 2013, it is anticipated that there will be increased levels of this stock landed into Ireland by foreign vessels.  I understand that negotiations are ongoing between representatives of the French fishing industry and Irish processing interests, with a view to increasing French landings into Ireland.  A pilot initiative was developed between BIM, Irish processors and French industry during late 2012.  All concerned are seeking to build on the success of this initiative in 2013.<\/p><p>  In relation to official controls carried out by the SFPA these are done in order to discharge Ireland's obligations under the Framework for the control of the Common Fisheries Policy in EU Waters  as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1224\/2009, establishing a Community control system to ensure compliance with the rules of the CFP and Council Regulation (EC) No 1005\/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.  Detailed rules for the implementation of the control regulation are set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404\/2011, and I have implemented these in national law through Statutory Instrument 320 of 2012 as amended.  This is the regulatory EU framework against which the SFPA carries out its inspection regime.<\/p><p>  These regulations contain an explicit default obligation requiring that all fish be weighed by operators at the point of landing.  In order to ensure a reasonable balance between the burden of compliance and the practicalities of fish landing, SFPA has pursued and achieved approval for landings to Ireland to avail of various derogations.  These allow, in particular for a sample weighing at landing, or a weighing after transport to an Irish premises.  In the case of landings to a Member State for transport to another Member State before weighing, the EU Regulation is prescriptive in only allowing that to occur under the terms of a Common Control Programme agreed between the landing MS and the weighing MS. I am pleased to inform you that due to active engagement by the SFPA with their French counterparts as part of overall pursuit of a level playing field for fisheries control, the EU Commission has approved the Common Control programme between Ireland and France, and anyone landing to Ireland may transport their fish directly to France for weighing, provided they work within the terms of this approved CCP.  The SFPA have engaged in a specific compliance programme including active dialogue with industry stakeholders, with view to discharging Ireland&rsquo;s obligations in this regard.<\/p><p>  At the request of the industry, I have recently added Castletownbere to the list of Irish ports at which third country landings can be processed and this is aimed  to facilitate  an increase in landings of Blue Whiting into Ireland by the Norwegian fleet.

I am aware that sheep prices for the year 2013 to date are disappointing for producers and are running at around 17% below the 2012 level for the corresponding period. This decline is reflected also in other EU member states and can be attributed to a number of factors including increased imports from New Zealand and the impact of austerity in Europe on demand generally. However, I would like to put the current difficulties in context.<\/p><p>  After successive years of decline, 2011\/12 saw an important turning point for the Irish sheep industry.  It was a period when confidence grew on the back of incremental growth in the national breeding flock.  This brought about increased throughput at farm and processing level. During that same period Irish sheep exports delivered double digit growth and retail sales of Irish lamb have grown steadily. These developments are in sharp contrast to other Member States, where sheep meat production and domestic consumption have been falling.  <\/p><p>  Throughout 2012 a higher demand from both the domestic and export markets were evenly matched with supplies, particularly during the peak periods of hogget and main season lamb supply.  Slaughterings in 2012 were up 12%, or 260,000 head to 2.43 million sheep.  This included 68,000 extra hoggets, 160,000 extra lambs and 32,000 additional ewes and rams slaughtered in 2012.   <\/p><p>  On another positive note, exports of Irish sheep meat registered a solid performance in 2012 where total value rose by 7% to &euro;205 million.  Seventy percent of our production was exported, the vast majority of which was destined for the EU market.  Just over 42,000 tonnes were exported to over 24 individual markets across the globe in 2012. France and the UK continue to be our core export markets representing three quarters of our volume exports.  Strong increases in shipments were recorded to Belgium, Germany and Sweden as exporters continue to secure new business and grow volume with existing customers. Despite the ongoing pressure on retail meat sales in Ireland, lamb held its own, with data from Kantar Worldpanel showing a rise of almost 4.5% for the 52 week period ending November 2012.<\/p><p>  Tighter global supplies that characterised the sheepmeat markets in 2011\/12 have eased slightly as global production edges up 1% to 13.6 million.  Good pastures and favourable lambing conditions in Australia and New Zealand have reversed four years of declining output. Production in both countries is forecast to grow by 3-5% this year. Due to the ongoing austerity in Europe and with an increase in the availability of cheaper lamb from the southern hemisphere, in comparison with 12 months ago, the price differential between New Zealand and EU lamb has been widening since summer 2012.  The carryover of UK hoggets into 2013 has also put downward pressure on prices in the early months of 2013. <\/p><p>  Today&rsquo;s consumer seeks value and is prepared to switch to a cheaper protein option.  Lamb is perceived as a relatively expensive meat and Bord Bia promotion campaigns play an important role in positioning lamb as a preferred choice. Increasing the frequency of purchase of Irish lamb and encouraging shoppers to look for the Bord Bia Quality Mark on-pack when shopping will be the key objective of the Bord Bia 2013 lamb promotions. Promotional activities will include radio advertising, which will be undertaken around Easter, announcing the arrival of early season lamb amongst consumers. Similarly, a series of promotional activities to include PR, publicity and in-store activities will be undertaken to coincide with peak availability of new season lamb. The TV advert highlighting the unique flavour of Irish lamb due to our ideal climate will play a central role in our 2013 promotions.<\/p><p>  Overall numbers of lamb producers in the Bord Bia Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme (LQAS) stand at just over 9,300, which roughly equates to 45% of our national throughput.  I recently launched the Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP), which I believe will be a key element in driving the ambitious target for the sheepmeat Sector in Food Harvest 2020. The STAP is intended to provide participants with the knowledge and the skills necessary to improve on-farm technical efficiency in a number of key areas. The sheep sector is a key part of the Agrifood sector, especially in marginal land areas and there is huge scope to improve farm incomes through focusing on issues such as grassland management, financial management, breeding, health and welfare and environmental efficiency. The STAP provides an opportunity to grow the membership base of the LQAS amongst lamb producers, while also promoting the adoption by farmers of best practice in the various aspects of sheep farming. I have allocated &euro;3 million to the STAP for 2013, with a maximum payment of &euro;1,000 per participant. Though the Grassland Sheep Scheme was due to expire at the end of 2012, I decided to extend it for another year and am providing some &euro;14 million for this purpose in 2013. The scheme will be funded from unspent Single Farm Payment funds. I am also providing for a continuation of the sheep fencing scheme in the amount of &euro;3 million this year to enable many farmers in the sheep sector to complete the necessary investment works in order to maintain competitiveness and introduce increased efficiencies on their farm and so secure the future of their enterprises.  I am confident that all of these initiatives will be of significant assistance in developing a strong and sustainable sheep sector for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRBB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":1387,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRBB02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1388,"qnumday":599,"qnumall":"[10240\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRBB02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the total number of farmers in the beef technology scheme in County Galway yet to be paid; if his attention has been drawn to an issue in relation to data inputting which appears to be causing a problem and which is putting farmers under severe pressure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1389,"content":"<p>Under Food Harvest 2020, ambitious development targets were set for a number of agricultural sectors, including the beef sector.

My Department maintains a permanent presence in approved slaughter plants. Regular visits are made to other Department approved meat plants. The frequency of these inspections in plants other than slaughter plants, which focus primarily on food safety requirements, is determined by a risk assessment, as required under EU legislation, which is conducted for each plant. My Department has been able to reduce the number of inspections at non-slaughter meat plants, where there is no permanent supervisory presence, by moving to a more robust and rigorous targeted system of official controls, based on the risk assessments mentioned above. Official controls and inspections levels are monitored independently by the EU Food and Veterinary Office and by the FSAI under service contract. <\/p><p>  Food business operators in Ireland are responsible inter alia for carrying out checks to ensure that their ingredients come from approved plants. In meat plants that operate under the supervision of the Department, official controls are conducted on these checks to verify their effectiveness. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. Labelling and documentary checks also form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. <\/p><p>  Under the Department&rsquo;s National Residue Programme, and including tests on bovine samples carried out by processors, up to 30,000 samples taken at farm and factory level and covering a wide range of food stuffs are tested annually. These tests relate to microbiological and chemical standards, their primary focus being on food safety. These are fully in accordance with EU testing requirements.  <\/p><p>  In addition the Product Official Sampling and Testing (POST) programme is a microbiological testing programme on samples taken from Department approved ready-to-eat food, meat product, minced meat and meat preparation plants i.e. added value plants. This is part of the official verification of food safety controls in the plants concerned as provided for in Regulations (EC) 852\/2004, 854\/2004 and 2073\/2005. A total of 1,600 samples are taken annually and the sampling and testing is risk based.<\/p><p>  The number of inspections has not been found to be inadequate as compliance with existing food safety and food hygiene requirements was not an issue in relation to the mislabelling of meat products uncovered by the recent FSAI survey. It is clear however that the focus of checks henceforth will also need to include food authenticity and the EU wide programme of DNA testing recently agreed will provide the basis for consideration of future action in this respect.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, in the light of recent developments, officials from my Department and the FSAI met with the meat processing sector on 14th  February to agree a national protocol for DNA testing of meat to be applied at retail, catering and processing level in Ireland.

One of these measures related to the number of weeks over which the free pre-school year could be provided.  At that time, approximately 30% of children in the relevant age-cohort were in full daycare.  Therefore, in order to facilitate full daycare services in the early years of the programme, services were permitted to choose between providing a 38 week or a 50 week model.<\/p><p>  I should emphasise that the ECCE programme is designed as an educational programme for children.  It was always intended, once the programme had bedded-down, to introduce a standard 38 week model.  This is primarily because this is the optimal model in terms of ensuring a high-quality early years experience for pre-school children.  The S&iacute;olta and Aistear frameworks were developed to support this objective. The ECCE programme is designed to be delivered across 38 weeks.  It is difficult to see how the curriculum can be delivered across a 50 week period when the children spend less time (generally 2 hours 15 minutes per day) availing of it.<\/p><p>  My focus is on improving the quality of childcare services.  For this reason, therefore, services participating in the ECCE programme are now required to provide the programme on the basis of 3 hours per day, 5 days per week, over 38 weeks. It is not mandatory that children attend every day but, where they do not, the capitation fee is reduced accordingly.   <\/p><p>  The change to the 38 week model only was introduced in September 2012 and all participating services have successfully made the transition to the new arrangement.

The intern year is an integral part of medical training and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.   Under the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 it is a matter for the HSE to assess, on an annual basis, the number of intern training posts required by the health service.  <\/p><p>  There were 572 intern posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. All 2012 EU graduates from Irish medical schools who sought an intern post here that year and met the HSE eligibility criteria were successful in securing a post. Indeed, to date there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools and a number of additional posts for some non-EU applicants. <\/p><p>  My Department is in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish\/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  It should be noted that under EU law intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying. <\/p><p>  The Higher Education Authority has indicated that the number of medical graduates this year has not yet been finalised. However, the application process for internships commencing in July 2013 closed in November last. A total of 960 eligible applications were received, 652 from EEA applicants and 308 from non-EEA applicants. There is no separate figure available for Irish applicants. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test; meet the HSE English language requirements; provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate; and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams. <\/p><p>  The HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July 2013. In total there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013 and the HSE consider that there will be sufficient capacity and funding to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRCC04100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Primary Care","counter":1477,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRCC04150"},{"type":"question","counter":1478,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[9609\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRCC04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the competition issues that have arisen with regard to the introduction of universal primary care; the discussions that have taken place with other Government Departments and agencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1479,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government provides for significant strengthening of primary care services to achieve Universal Primary Care (UPC) with the removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients.

Part of the debate about the future of our health system overall has been about the most appropriate role for the private sector, and the balance to be drawn between it and the public and voluntary sectors.  The Government is committed to the continued development of a mixed health care system in Ireland, drawing on the strengths of all three sectors.  That said, we are committed to the development of a single-tier health service, in which the distinction between &lsquo;public&rsquo; and &lsquo;private&rsquo; patient is removed.  We can no longer accept a situation where patients can queue-jump because they can afford to pay for faster access.<\/p><p>  Within this context, I believe that the free market has an important role to play, provided that the system is regulated effectively to protect quality and to control costs. For example, private hospitals play an important role in delivering acute services in Ireland, and private companies also deliver community based services, such as home supports for older people.  The move to Universal Health Insurance will involve a very important role for the private sector, in which health insurers will compete for business in a manner designed to drive efficiencies and offer customers choice between funders of health care. While the overall approach to reform will be informed by the experience of other countries and best practice the system as a whole will be uniquely Irish.  Whatever the precise configuration of services as between public, voluntary and private, and whatever the exact role of a regulated free market within the system, my priority is to ensure that all patients and clients receive the best possible service for the lowest cost, in the setting that is most appropriate to their needs.

The FSAI then arranged further intense testing of the samples to validate the correctness of the initial analysis and to quantify the amount of horse DNA in each sample - the results of these tests were received on 11 January 2013. These results showed that, of the 10 burgers found to contain horse DNA, one contained 29% horsemeat, another 0.3% and the remainder had less than 0.1%. Traces of horse DNA were also detected in batches of raw ingredients, including some imported from other Member States.

Furthermore, the Minister for Agriculture, Food &amp; the Marine has initiated and led a rapid and collective response to the horsemeat incident in Europe in his capacity as President of Council of Agriculture Ministers.<\/p><p>  While this is not a food safety issue, officials from my Department are in daily contact with the FSAI in relation to the ongoing horsemeat incident in Europe to ensure there remains no threat to public health.  Since January, extensive sampling and testing of beef products by both regulatory authorities and the food industry has been undertaken. Testing is continuing in Ireland and elsewhere. A major EU wide programme of testing of beef products for the presence of equine DNA is now underway. While many sausage and black and white puddings are pork rather than beef based products, to date no evidence has emerged to suggest they are the subject of adulteration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRDD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Services","counter":1528,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRDD03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1529,"qnumday":648,"qnumall":"[9687\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRDD03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is satisfied with the current waiting times at the accident and emergency department in Kerry General Hospital; if there is an adequate complement of staff currently working in the the A&amp;E; the way current waiting times compare with the previous five years and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1530,"content":"<p>In relation to the query on staffing raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.

The HSE anticipates that all EU graduates from Irish medical schools who meet the eligibility criteria for intern posts and who desire to remain in Ireland for an internship starting in July 2013, will be accommodated within the Irish public health service. The HSE has in place formal agreements with the Intern Training Networks\/Universities regarding the provision of the Medical Council accredited National Intern Training Programme. <\/p><p>  The main reforms of the intern year as recommended by the Report of the National Committee on Medical Education and Training (NCMET) have been implemented by the HSE in collaboration and consultation with the Medical Council and the relevant educational partners at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. The HSE has formal agreements in place with the recognised postgraduate medical training bodies in Ireland regarding the provision of specialist medical education and training to the Non Consultant Hospital Doctor (NCHD) cohort in Ireland.  These agreements set out the number of doctors to be trained by each training body both by year of training and by specialty.  This number is determined by the HSE following consultation with the training bodies and consideration of current and future workforce requirements for qualified specialists.<\/p><p>  The HSE also has formal agreements in place with the recognised postgraduate medical training bodies in Ireland regarding the provision of professional development programmes to NCHDs not engaged in specialist training in Ireland.  The objective of these programmes is to facilitate this cohort of doctors to maintain their professional competence.  In recent years the HSE has invested significantly in the expansion and development of existing and new specialist medical training programmes including the development of a basic specialist training programme in Emergency Medicine; the expansion and reconfiguration of specialist training in Anaesthesia; and an increase in GP training numbers from 120 per year to 157, in line with GP workforce requirements.  <\/p><p>  In addition, the HSE has implemented two scholarship programmes specifically targeting NCHDs in their latter stages of training. The first programme enables NCHDs to undertake specialist training in novel medical areas abroad with a view to returning and developing their new expertise within the Irish health service as specialists. The second programme supports NCHDs in undertaking an integrated PhD research programme with their higher specialist training, thereby further developing high quality relevant clinical research in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRDD03400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Trusts","counter":1534,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRDD03450"},{"type":"question","counter":1535,"qnumday":650,"qnumall":"[9695\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRDD03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he considers that criteria such as existing partnerships, existing geographical links and patient access to appropriate services will be key in choosing the appropriate partnerships in his Department's project plan for the establishment of acute hospital groups which would support the co-location of the Rotunda and Mater Hospitals, Dublin, as indicated by KPMG report of 2008; if, at the very least, he will not make a final decision until after the publication of the review of maternity models of care currently being undertaken by the Health Service Executive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1536,"content":"<p>A key stepping stone to the introduction of Universal Health Insurance will be to develop independent not-for-profit hospital trusts in which all hospitals will function as part of an integrated group.

The Department will meet with the FSAI prior to the May meeting to ensure that Irish health policy is reflected during those discussions.  In 2012, my Department requested the FSAI to conduct a national consultation on the display of calories on menus.  Over 95% of respondents expressed their support for this initiative.  I then wrote personally to a range of fast food restaurants requesting that they display calories on menus on a voluntary basis.  Recent monitoring information from the FSAI, found that almost half of the 19 fast food restaurants, coffee shops and catering companies are now displaying calories on menus.  I consider that this will help consumers to make healthier eating choices.  To assist the companies concerned, the FSAI has published technical instructions for Irish food business operators.  It is also in the process of developing a software tool to help Irish companies to count the calories in dishes that are on menus for more than 30 days per year.  The FSAI is currently conducting a large telephone survey and quality assessment evaluating the uptake of calorie menu labelling by Food Service Businesses in Ireland. The final survey results will be ready for publication in March 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WREE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treatment Purchase Fund","counter":1583,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WREE02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1584,"qnumday":673,"qnumall":"[9817\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WREE02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the annual spend from the National Treatment Purchase Fund from 2009 to 2012 for the treatment of bilateral cochlear implants abroad; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1585,"content":"<p>No spending has been incurred by the National Treatment Purchase Fund during the period 2009 to 2012 for such treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WREE03000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1586,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WREE03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1587,"qnumday":674,"qnumall":"[9831\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WREE03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will review an application for a medical card in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare whose financial circumstances have changed since their original application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1588,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WREE03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1589,"content":"<p>Question No. 675 answered with Question No. 617.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cochlear Implants","counter":1591,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRFF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1592,"qnumday":676,"qnumall":"[9838\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRFF00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive intends to upgrade and enhance the audiology unit in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; if the HSE intends to make resources available to enable all children who require bilateral cochlear implants to have the essential procedure carried out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1067","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1593,"qnumday":679,"qnumall":"[9855\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRFF00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the outcome of the business plan submission made by Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, for consideration in the 2013 Service Plan for the provision of bilateral cochlear implants; the action being taken and the timeframe involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1594,"qnumday":714,"qnumall":"[10229\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRFF00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 671, 735 and 736 of 19 February 2013, the steps that will be put in place to deal with children who suffer late onset hearing impairment or deafness which may not be picked up in new born screening; the way this group will be affected by any decision that the Health Service Executive and Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, come to in relation to cochlear implants; if he envisages an age cut off point; if guidelines will be put in place to identify which children are suitable for bilateral implants; if he will ensure that those children who suffer from late onset hearing impairment will not be discriminated against.","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1595,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 676, 679 and 714 together.<\/p><p>  The HSE undertook a National Review of Audiology Services.

As well as its long standing links with the Mater, which can and should be retained, it would also be appropriate for the Rotunda to establish links with other hospitals to meet its future aspirations for sub-specialty development and to expand and consolidate the links which currently exist.<\/p><p><br \/>  The KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin, which was completed in 2008, noted that Dublin&#8217;s model of stand alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be co-located with adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new national paediatric hospital. The intention has been that the National Maternity Hospital should be relocated to St Vincent's, the Coombe to Tallaght and the Rotunda to the Mater, and the maternity hospitals have been working with the relevant adult sites to progress this. There will be early discussions with the maternity hospitals regarding their maternity \/adult co-location plans in the context of the Government decision to build the new children&#8217;s hospital on the St James&#8217;s campus.  Notwithstanding this, I am committed to the intent of the report - that the Dublin maternity hospitals be located alongside adult acute services - while also bearing in mind the  need to plan for the provision of tri-located paediatric , adult and maternity services, as is the intention in relation to the new children's hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRHH00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services","counter":1717,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRHH00525"},{"type":"question","counter":1718,"qnumday":722,"qnumall":"[10256\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRHH00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons awaiting orthodontic treatment in County Kerry; the length of time they are waiting; the progress that has been made to reduce the waiting lists in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1719,"content":"<p>The HSE provides orthodontic treatment to patients based on their level of clinical need.

where the income guidelines are exceeded.The HSE set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.  There is an emergency process for a person who is terminally ill, or in urgent need of medical attention and cannot afford to pay for it, that provides a card within 24 hours while the normal application process is completed.Once a letter from the patient's GP or consultant is received stating that the person is terminally ill and the required personal details are provided, an emergency card is issued to that person for a six-month period.  The Programme for Government commits to reforming the current public health system by introducing Universal Health Insurance with equal access to care for all.

To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0with effect\u00a0from 1st   April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.\u00a0<\/p><p>  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee\u00a0in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport. There is significant\u00a0 scope for\u00a0achieving greater levels of transport integration and coordinated delivery across a range of Exchequer funded local and rural transport services such as school and HSE transport services.<\/p><p>  I am very aware of the very valuable work done on the ground by the RTP Groups such as Westmeath Rural Transport in ensuring that the transport needs of their local community are being identified and delivered within available resources. However, given\u00a0 resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the establishment of better alignment between the 35 RTP groups and local authorities, it is\u00a0necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised. <\/p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. \u00a0One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Coordination Units be established.\u00a0 Discussions are taking place with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the County and City Managers Association and the Rural Transport Network in the context of aligning the new structure with the local authority structure. \u00a0I would emphasise that no decision has been taken but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.<\/p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the rural transport programme will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector. \u00a0Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.   While I can understand and fully appreciate that this creates a level of uncertainty for RTP groups, I am hopeful that the outcome will be a better service delivered more efficiently. I will work with all involved over the coming months to make any transition as smooth as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRJJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driving Licences","counter":1779,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRJJ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":1780,"qnumday":747,"qnumall":"[9631\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600055#WRJJ01100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will report on the process of establishing a new system of photo capture for driving licences which has been awarded solely to the National Driver Licence Service; if there was a competitive tendering process for his new system; his views regarding the impact of the ending of photo ID services in local business including local pharmacies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1781,"content":"<p>Following a Government decision, the driver licensing service has been centralised under the Road Safety Authority (RSA).

A resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants will continue to be an important priority for the Government in our ongoing contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  This issue will remain a central feature of the Government&rsquo;s engagement with the US authorities over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period, and my programme and that of other members of the Government, while not yet finalised, will include meetings with key political figures and the Irish community groups that provide assistance to the undocumented. <\/p><p>  The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election.  The emphasis he placed on immigration reform in his inauguration address as well as in subsequent speeches, including the State of the Union address, sent a very positive signal in this regard.  The indications of emerging bipartisan support for reform in Congress is also encouraging.  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system before the shape of any legislative deal is clear.  It is therefore not possible at this stage to identify an exact timescale in which these may become clear but the area will continue to receive the Government&rsquo;s close attention over the period ahead.<\/p><p>  To reinforce the Irish government&rsquo;s interest in the issue I am currently undertaking a round of contacts with key Senators.  Most recently, I spoke with Senator John McCain to express the Government&rsquo;s appreciation for the efforts he and others are making in developing bi-partisan Senate proposals and to underline our ongoing interest in the issue, and with Senator Pat Leahy who is chair of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate.

The camp had been set up by Sahrawi people protesting against their perceived marginalisation, and demanding jobs and adequate housing.   According to reports, eleven members of the security forces and two Sahrawis were killed during the violence.  <\/p><p>Over 200 Sahrawis were subsequently arrested by Moroccan security forces, of whom most were released but 25 were put on trial before the military court in Rabat as a result of their involvement.  On Sunday 17th   February, the military court handed down nine life sentences and sentenced 14 other defendants to between 20-30 years imprisonment each.  Two other defendants were released. It is believed the verdicts will now be appealed to the Moroccan Court of Cassation.  <\/p><p>  The accused have already spent two years in pre-trial detention prison and there have been allegations of torture during their imprisonment.  Concerns have also been expressed regarding the fact that the defendants have been tried in a military rather than a civilian court.

The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has also expressed concerns over the case.  <\/p><p>  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern regarding this case and my officials will continue to closely monitor the situation and the process regarding the appeal of the sentences.  The Government will continue to raise concerns about human rights abuses in Western Sahara, in particular reports of the arbitrary arrest, detention and mistreatment of human rights defenders, with Morocco in our ongoing bilateral dialogue.   Ireland has consistently called for the mandate of MINURSO, the United Nations Mission in Western Sahara monitoring the ceasefire with Western Sahara, to include a human rights monitoring element.

Accordingly, when the Department publishes the <i>Stability Programme Update<\/i>   in April it will contain official fiscal and macroeconomic forecasts until 2016.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Looking at the fiscal impact of the promissory note deal, there are some aspects of the deal which are yet to be finalised.  For example, the liquidator is in the process of overseeing a valuation and sales process for the assets of IBRC, while the final payments made under the ELG Scheme have not yet been determined.<\/p><p><br \/>  Nevertheless, simulations ran by my Department estimate that the General Government deficit will improve by approximately &#8364;1 billion per annum over the medium term and this should be instructive to the Deputy.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government&#8217;s focus is on stabilising the General Government debt to GDP ratio and beginning the process of reducing it to a lower, safer level over time. The latest official forecast  of General Government Debt was contained in Budget 2013, which projected General Government Debt peaking in 2013 before falling gradually though the forecast horizon.   The debt rule in the Fiscal Compact, which implements the Stability &amp; Growth Pact provisions, requires us to reduce that part of the debt ratio which is above the threshold rate of 60 per cent annually by at least one-twentieth of the difference between the actual rate and the threshold rate.   <\/p><p><br \/>  A transition period will apply for all countries, including Ireland, that are currently subject to the excessive deficit procedure. During this transition period, which would last for three years following the correction of the excessive deficit, the requirement under the debt correction rule is deemed to be fulfilled if we are making &#8220;sufficient progress&#8221; towards compliance. <\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of the fiscal implications of this debt correction rule, it is important to remember that it is the debt to GDP debt ratio that is important, not the overall nominal level of General Government debt. In other words, on the basis of reasonable assumptions over the medium-term, we can expect economic growth to do much of the work in this regard. <\/p><p><br \/>  Obviously, the reduced borrowing requirement over the medium term arising from the promissory note deal will help us to achieve our debt targets more quickly.<\/p><p><br \/>  Additionally, the terms of the Fiscal Compact Treaty require us to converge towards our Medium Term Budgetary Objective once we are out of the EU\/IMF Programme. It should be noted that the MTO is a structural balance target, net of one-offs and cyclical factors. For Ireland, the conversion of our structural budget position into nominal figures is a complex process. It is too early to try and do this in respect of the period 2018-2025 sought by the Deputy. <\/p><p><br \/>  I would emphasise the point that while the agreement on the promissory note is a significant step forward in restoring sustainability to our public finances, this Government is well aware that there remains a considerable gap between what we get in revenue and what we spend. This situation is not sustainable over the longer term. In addition to the requirements to bring our deficit to under 3% of GDP by 2015 as per the EDP, it makes sense that we bring balance back to the public finances and stabilise and reduce our debt burden.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600057#WRF03500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banks Recapitalisation","counter":1904,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600057#WRF03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1905,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[9555\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600057#WRF03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the details of all investments made by the State directly or through the National Pensions Reserve Fund in the pillar banks and in Irish Life and Permanent; the current market value of these investments; the estimated value these investments will have in 2018 based on the projected performance of the banks and presuming no sale of these investments in the meantime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":1906,"content":"<p>The bank recapitalisation commitments made by the State to date are set out in the following table:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Government preference Shares (2009) - NPRF<\/th><th>3.5<\/th><th>3.5*<\/th><th>-<\/th><th>-<\/th><th>7.0<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Capital contributions (with Promissory Notes as consideration) \/Special Investment Shares (2010) &#8211; Exchequer **<\/td><td>0.9<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>30.7<\/td><td>31.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ordinary Share Capital (2009) &#8211; Exchequer<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>4.0<\/td><td>4.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ordinary Share Capital (2010) - NPRF<\/td><td>3.7<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>3.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total pre-PCAR 2011 (A)<\/td><td>8.1<\/td><td>3.5<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>34.7<\/td><td>46.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Capital from Exchequer***<\/td><td>3.9<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>4.0<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>7.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NPRF Capital <\/td><td>8.8<\/td><td>1.2<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>10.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total PCAR (B)<\/td><td>12.7<\/td><td>1.2<\/td><td>4.0<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>17.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Cost of Recap for State (A) + (B)<\/td><td>20.7<\/td><td>4.7<\/td><td>4.0<\/td><td>34.7<\/td><td>64.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>* &#8364;1.7bn of BoI&#8217;s government preference shares were converted to equity in May\/June 2010 (&#8364;1.8bn still left in existence).

One of the proposals is on the monitoring and assessment of draft budgetary plans and on ensuring the correction of excessive deficits. The other is on the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance and sets out explicit rules for enhanced surveillance of countries experiencing or threatened with financial difficulties.<b><font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font><\/b>The agreement reached on 20 February will have to be approved by member countries and the European Parliament. The &quot;two-pack&quot; will be a significant and welcome enhancement of the euro area&#8217;s economic governance regime. It is, to a great extent, a natural extension of the measures contained in the &#8216;six-pack&#8217; which was introduced on 13 December, 2011. The &#8216;six-pack&#8217; - comprising five regulations and one directive - reformed and strengthened fiscal surveillance under the <i>Stability and Growth Pact<\/i>   and introduced new macroeconomic surveillance. <\/p><p><br \/>  The &#8216;two-pack&#8217; is applicable to euro area member countries only. <\/p><p><br \/>  The proposed surveillance regulation provides for surveillance under a number of circumstances, specifically, where a member state is experiencing severe difficulties with regard to its financial stability and where this is likely to have adverse spillover effect on other Member States, where a member state is in a macroeconomic adjustment programme, and also post-programme surveillance. There are specific features attaching to each of these.  However, in the case of enhanced surveillance, it is a matter for the Commission to decide every six months whether to prolong the enhanced surveillance.  Under the regulation, a post-programme surveillance process will be put in place and maintained for a member country until the balance outstanding under EU-sourced financial assistance falls below 25% of the total. This covers all EU funding sources, including bilateral loans.  It also provides that the Commission shall conduct, in liaison with the ECB, regular review missions in the Member State under post-programme surveillance to assess its economic, fiscal and financial situation. <\/p><p>The reports generated following such missions shall be considered by the European Council which - acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission - may recommend to the Member State concerned to adopt corrective measures.  The regulation provides that the duration of post-programme surveillance may be extended by the Council on a proposal from the Commission <i>&#8220;in the case of persistent risks to the financial or fiscal sustainability of the Member State concerned.<\/i>   Post-programme surveillance is a normal feature of IMF assistance programmes, and this regulation provides for a similar arrangement for the EU.  <\/p><p>The other proposed regulation concerns <i>&#8216;the monitoring and assessment of draft budgetary plans and on ensuring the correction of excessive deficits&#8217;<\/i>   in euro area Member States. It will apply to all countries in the euro area, with special provisions including in relation to reporting requirements being made for those which are subject to an excessive deficit procedure.   This draft regulation specifies that all euro area Member States, not in a macroeconomic adjustment programme, will be required to submit to the Commission and the Eurogroup and make public a draft budgetary plan no later than 15 October each year.  The draft budgetary plan will be assessed by the Commission, which shall adopt an opinion on it by the end of November.  The draft regulation also provides that the Commission may request a revised draft budgetary plan in exceptional circumstances where it identifies particularly serious non-compliance with the budgetary obligations laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact.<\/p><p><br \/>  This Government is firmly committed to reducing the deficit to below 3% by 2015 and to achieve a structural balance thereafter in line with the stability treaty.  These regulations make no changes to these rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600059#WRH02700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Collection","counter":2008,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600059#WRH02750"},{"type":"question","counter":2009,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[10115\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600059#WRH02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if it is his intention that the property tax will be payable in instalments using various mediums such as An Post, the banks, the credit union and PayPal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"990","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":2010,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that commencing in March 2013 residential property owners will receive their Local Property Tax (LPT) Return from Revenue together with an LPT booklet, which will provide details of the payment options available to pay the tax.

In addition to the payment of the local authority grant, two other conditions must be met, to qualify for the reduction.  Firstly, the person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  Secondly, the liable person in relation to the property must notify the Revenue Commissioners in writing of the amount of the chargeable value that is attributable to the adaptation along with any relevant documentation.  The reduction in value is limited to the lesser of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  This chargeable value is to be used in relation to subsequent valuations of the property, unless additional grant-aided work is carried out.  The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property that has been adapted, unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property.

In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption will only apply where the cost of the adaptations exceeds 25% of the chargeable value of the property before it is adapted.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that LPT is a self-assessment tax, so in the first instance, it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the chargeable value of the property.  I would like to clarify that the Revenue Commissioners will not be involved, as a matter of routine, in valuing individual properties.    As part of the general issue of Returns, beginning in March 2013, property owners will also receive an information booklet and a Revenue Estimate of LPT.  The Revenue Estimate is not based on a valuation of each owner&rsquo;s individual property, nor should it be regarded as an accurate calculation of the amount of LPT that they should pay.  Once the property owner meets his or her obligations by valuing the property, submitting the Return and advising Revenue of his or her payment method within the relevant time limits, the Revenue Estimate of LPT notified to the owner is no longer relevant. However, if the property owner considers that the amount shown on the Notice of Estimate accurately reflects his or her self-assessment, he or she should complete the Return on that basis, select a payment option and submit the Return.<\/p><p>  The Commissioners are actively preparing valuation guidance which, taken together with the owner&rsquo;s own knowledge of the property, will assist him or her in assessing its value.  The guidance will include an on-line guide that will provide indicative property valuation bands depending on the property type, age and location, and it will be available on the Revenue website prior to the issue of Returns to property owners.  The guidance will also draw property owners&rsquo; attention to the publicly available property price register produced by the Property Services Regulatory Authority which provides an actual sales price for all properties sold in the State since January 2010.

In formulating an enrolment policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful and applied fairly to all applicants.<\/p><p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the rights of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.<\/p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.<\/p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600060#WRJ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Training","counter":2067,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600060#WRJ02550"},{"type":"question","counter":2068,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[9626\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600060#WRJ02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reasons for the change in procedure whereby B.Ed students of a college (details supplied) in County Limerick now pay for two weeks attendance at Irish College during first and second year when this cost was included in colleges fees heretofore; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"975","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":2069,"content":"<p>As part of the Government's budgetary considerations and the Comprehensive Expenditure Review carried out in 2011, a decision was made to abolish the payments by this Department towards the cost of attendance at Gaeltacht courses by students commencing their programme of primary initial teacher education.

The OPW is currently reviewing its own apprenticeship requirements and should resources permit, may be in a position to recruit further apprentices later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600062#WRL03900","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Funding","counter":2197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600062#WRL04000"},{"type":"question","counter":2198,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[10259\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600062#WRL04100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"in view of a reoccurring flooding problem in Sneem, County Kerry which affects a number of properties and actually endangers public safety, if funding will be provided to carry out the work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":2199,"content":"<p>Following an examination and inspections, the OPW has identified mitigation measures that may provide a solution to the flooding problem in Sneem.

Also in 2009, the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Acts of 2009 abolished the payment of long service increments (LSIs) to members from the formation of the current Oireachtas.  As LSIs are no longer payable, current Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad will not have LSIs included in their pension calculations, regardless of whether or not they had been at one time in receipt of those increments.<\/p><p>  Under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010, a further reduction in pay was imposed on the remuneration of members of the then Cabinet.  This Government itself imposed a policy of strong pay reduction and restraint since taking office in March 2011 with the pay of all members of the Government voluntarily reduced from its first day in Office.  Section 6 (c) of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Act, 2011 provided the legislative basis for these pay reductions from 1 January 2012.  The effect of these reductions is that the gross annual salary of An Taoiseach has been reduced by nearly 30% since December 2009, and that of the T&aacute;naiste and Ministers by nearly 25% from December 2009, excluding the impact of the pension related deduction.<\/p><p>  In relation to allowances in the nature of pay, following reductions and abolitions by the previous Government to a number of allowances related to Committees, the system of allowances paid to Members was substantially overhauled by this Government in 2011 upon taking office.  The rate of allowances paid to Chairpersons of Oireachtas Committees and to Commission Members were reduced further, representing reductions in the region of 50% on the June 2009 rates.  The total estimated cost of the current measures in respect of these allowances is now less than &euro;400,000, compared to a cost in 2008 of &euro;1.436 million.<\/p><p>  In the context of the Expenditure Estimates for 2013, I announced that a 10% reduction will be applied to the Party Leaders&rsquo; Allowance rates payable to qualifying leaders of political parties and to qualifying independent members.  I also announced that severance payments payable to Ministers and other Officeholders upon cessation of Office are to be abolished.  My Department has already commenced preparations on the changes to primary legislation necessary to effect those changes.<\/p><p>  Prior to the introduction of the new Parliamentary Standard Allowance expenses regime from 1 March 2010, the previous expenses regime had been reduced by 10%, except for mileage which had been reduced by 25% in the case of mileage. <\/p><p>  Since 1 May 2011, Cabinet Ministers with the exception of Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Law Reform now use their own cars on official business.  Ministers of State have used their own cars on official business since 1984.  It was estimated at the time that the saving to be achieved in not supplying State cars to Cabinet Ministers was of the order of &euro;4m per annum.<\/p><p>  In December 2012, I announced further cuts to the Oireachtas expense allowance regime as follows: <\/p><p>(i)   reduced the rates of the Travel and Accommodation [TAA] element of the allowance by 25% for Dublin (less than 25km) and by 10% for the other bands,<\/p><p>(ii)  eliminated the unvouched element of the Public Representational Allowance [PRA], subject to permitting monthly expenditure in the nature of &ldquo;petty cash&rdquo; for incidental expenses per month of &euro;100 for each Deputy and &euro;75 for each Senator [and subject to limits in (iii) below], and<\/p><p>(iii) reduced the vouched expenditure limits under the PRA to &euro;20,350 for Deputies, &euro;16,000 for Minister and Minister of Sate, and &euro;12,225 for Senators.<\/p><p>  It also reduced the monthly pre-paid envelope allowance for Deputies and Senators by 50%, to 625 for Deputies and 375 for Senators, and to eliminate the unvouched options of the secretarial support allowances.<\/p><p>  All of these changes have resulted in, and will generate future, significant financial savings to the Exchequer.

In this regard, I would refer the Deputy to my reply on this issue (PQ 3066\/13 - answered 23\/01\/13).<\/p><p>  The inclusion of a social clause in all public procurement contracts requiring that a quota young unemployed people or long-term unemployed be employed in the delivery of the contract poses a number of risks. Firstly, it is against EU Treaty principles to discriminate between people on the basis of age. Secondly, in the current economic climate, and in particular bearing in mind the difficulties in the construction sector, businesses have for obvious reasons been reducing their existing workforce rather than taking on new employees. Consequently, it would be expected that, where a business is awarded a public contract, the work would be carried out by the existing employees of that business. In such circumstances a social clause requiring that a number of long-term unemployed be employed in delivering a public contract could either impose an additional cost on SMEs that they may not be able to afford, or result in an employee of the supplier being let go in favour of a long-term unemployed person. <\/p><p>  The Government has a wide range of measures that it is deploying to facilitate job creation and support labour activation, with particular emphasis on assisting long term unemployed people.  Obviously, the main purpose of the public procurement process is to ensure that goods, services and works are purchased by the State in a manner that is legal, transparent and of high probity, and our key requirement is the achievement of value for money.  Within this context, my Department and the National Procurement Service are examining the use of social clauses as an additional means of supporting activation and we are seeking to identify the scope for the use of social clauses in parts of the capital area in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600063#WRM00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":2234,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600063#WRM00950"},{"type":"question","counter":2235,"qnumday":295,"qnumall":"[3971\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600063#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he has met the social partners since this round of talks has commenced on the Croke Park agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":2236,"content":"<p>I met representatives of the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in December last regarding the commencement of discussions with public service management on a new agenda for reductions in the cost of delivering public services and substantial longer term productivity improvements and workplace reforms. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, I attended a plenary meeting of the parties yesterday at which the Labour Relations Commission presented proposals after intensive discussions over the weekend.

Under the CER, multi-annual current expenditure ceilings are fixed for each Department in order to make clear, in advance, the resources available for each area and the level of savings required. The intention of this reform measure is to improve the focus on medium-term, structural and strategic planning of expenditure within each area and to prevent spending overruns where possible. <\/p><p>  Good progress has been made to advance reforms in the area of evidence-based expenditure policy. This includes actions taken in relation to the Public Spending Code to consolidate existing procedures in this area and modernise them in line with best national and international practice. These reforms are supported by the establishment of a Public Service Evaluation Network, reforms to the Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review process and the introduction of new Focused Policy Assessments designed to answer specific issues of policy configuration and delivery.<\/p><p>  With regard to the specific areas referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) are key enablers to delivering improved public services. In 2012, my Department published the eGovernment Strategy 2012-2015 and the Cloud Commuting Strategy, which identified necessary actions to enhance the delivery of public services using ICT. While these strategies were developed by my Department in conjunction with the Public Service Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council, the specific responsibility for implementation of actions arising from these strategies and for assessing the efficiencies that arise, including enhancing ICT capability, is a matter for each individual Department and Office.<\/p><p>  The Reform Plan has given an added impetus to the OPW&rsquo;s on-going drive to reduce rental outgoings.  Through a programme of lease surrenders and rent reviews, The OPW has reduced the annual rental cost of Civil Service accommodation by approximately &euro;25 million. The Reform Plan has been given further support by a specific Government decision mandating the OPW to further rationalise Civil Service accommodation and produce more space efficient accommodation standards. This will facilitate the surrender of the maximum feasible number of leases as lease breaks arise thus further reducing the Government's rental costs. As part of this process, the OPW has been asked to work with the various sectors within the Public Service, e.g., Local Authorities, HSE, etc., to develop standards and protocols that will facilitate the sharing of buildings and the transfer of property, thus reducing the State's overall property costs.<\/p><p>  A decision-making model for Shared Services has been established to evaluate value for money to the taxpayer for all Shared Services programmes under my Department&rsquo;s remit. A cost-benefit analysis to assess the potential efficiencies that a Shared Services Centre can deliver, of both pay and non-payroll expenditure, is carried out in respect of each proposed Shared Service programme. This analysis is assessed with comparable benchmarks elsewhere to identify the opportunity for improving cost efficiencies and effectiveness for a specific function. These make up a significant part of the overall business case. The business case also considers a number of possible options and assesses the financial and non-financial value of each of those options. Each Shared Service programme has a business case submitted for peer review to the Shared Service Transformation Unit and the Central Economic Evaluation Unit (for evaluation of the financial and non-financial assumptions against the Public Spending Code). <\/p><p>  The methodology I have described above allows me to report that the Human Resources and Pensions Shared Services Centre for the Civil Service, PeoplePoint, is expected to yield combined pay and non-pay savings in the region of an annual net saving of &euro;12.5 million by 2014 while the number of staff involved in delivering these services will reduce by a minimum of 17%. The first transitions to PeoplePoint are expected at the end of March 2013, with all 40 in scope bodies to be transitioned by the end of 2014. A similar approach has been taken to develop a business case for Payroll Shared Services and to assess the baseline performance of Banking and Financial Management for consideration for Shared Services. A cost-benefit analysis for Shared Services projects notified to my Department is also being undertaken across the Public Service sectors of Health and Local Government.<\/p><p>  I would also point out that the Progress Reports published by the Implementation Body overseeing progress on the Public Service Agreement have identified significant non-pay administrative efficiency savings. Two reports have been issued to date &ndash; the first in June 2011 and the second in June 2012. <\/p><p>  Overall, good progress has been made on delivering savings and implementing the Public Service Reform Plan. Of course, it remains a matter for each Minister and their Departments to ensure that the Vote-level allocations are adhered to and at the same time ensure that they continue to provide essential front-line services and respond to increasing demands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600063#WRM01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Funding","counter":2247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600063#WRM01850"},{"type":"question","counter":2248,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[10327\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600063#WRM01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when he will provide funding or to have work undertaken to deal with flooding problems caused by the River Reane in the Fenagh area near Ballinamore, County Leitrim; if his attention has been drawn to the concerns of the local community in relation to the damage caused by recent flooding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":2249,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works recently approved funding of &euro;10,000 under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp; Coastal Protection Scheme to Leitrim County Council to carry out a feasibility study to assess the flooding problem at River Reane at Tully Lough in the Fenagh area.

The overall Irish success rate at 22.7%, is above the European Member State average of 22.1%, and a very positive indication of the prospects for Irish participation over the lifetime of FP7 and broadly in line with our national targets.   Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in the 2013 work programme is expected to reflect participation to date, i.e. demonstrating an application success rate above the EU average. <\/p><p>  In July 2012, the European Commission launched its final and largest ever package of FP7 calls, an &euro;8.1 billion work programme for 2013.  This work programme is currently underway, with closing dates for proposals spanning September 2012 to year end 2013. Funding will be awarded in 2013 &ndash; 2014.   <\/p><p>  The limited budget attached to the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) means that it is not an expenditure-orientated programme like FP7 or the Cohesion Policy Funds, but one that seeks to achieve its ambitions and broadly defined objects by leveraging its ideas, products and partnerships into other policies and programmes. Enterprise Ireland will be engaging with CIP funding for 2013 through the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) which is the primary instrument for the CIP programme.  As suitable calls arise, the EEN will be engaging with its client base.   One very concrete benefit to Ireland and SMEs from this programme is its joint funding of the Enterprise Europe Network, which is in the region of &euro;450,000 per year.<\/p><p>  In relation to Pre-Commercial Procurement,  there is Irish involvement in two pilot programmes in the CIP ICT Policy Support Programme. These pilot programmes mainly address interoperability of public service pilots on a large scale across Europe, with the ultimate objective of wide-scale service uptake eventually by all 27 member states.  Under this year&rsquo;s 2013 call for this work programme, PPI (Public Procurement of Innovative solutions) instruments will be used for the first time, in anticipation of their wide-scale use in Horizon 2020 to fund innovation procurement.<\/p><p>  While there has been no Irish participation to date in FP7 ICT PCP projects, there are some PCP topics within the current ICT call and there is evidence of some interest by Irish academia in exploring the feasibility of involvement with a PCP in the technology-enhanced learning area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600063#WRM02400","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Issues","counter":2256,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600063#WRM02450"},{"type":"question","counter":2257,"qnumday":303,"qnumall":"[10253\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600063#WRM02500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if the Cabinet Committee on Job Creation has investigated the jobs crisis in County Kerry; if it will request the Industrial Development Agency to prioritise County Kerry for jobs investment in view of the fact that the county lost Objective 1 Status in 1998 and the fact that the three nearest counties have fared exceptionally better with IDA site visits, County Cork 31, County Limerick 13 and County Clare six; if he and the Cabinet Committee on Job Creation will request the IDA to give the county the jobs boost it so urgently requires; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":2258,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[10277\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600063#WRM02600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of jobs announced by the Industrial Development Agency and Enterprise Ireland for County Kerry in each of the following years, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":2259,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 303 and 315 together. <\/p><p>  I have been informed by IDA Ireland that, in the five year period 2008 to 2012, there were three IDA job announcements for County Kerry with the potential to create 155 jobs. During the same period, there were two Enterprise Ireland investment announcements with the potential to create 41 jobs and nine High Potential Start Up (HPSU) projects announced for county Kerry.  For reasons of commercial sensitivity, it is not possible to give details of the job potential of these HPSU projects.  <\/p><p>  At the end of 2012 there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry employing 1,600 people, while Enterprise Ireland had 132 client companies in the county employing 3,318 people. <\/p><p>  In relation to the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to County Kerry, IDA Ireland has indicated that the challenge it faces is to continue to win top quality investment for Ireland in a very challenging global environment. International competition for FDI has become extremely intense and continues to increase.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world class physical and digital infrastructure as well as the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  IDA Ireland, however, tries to influence these choices by prioritising the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass with sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services, etc. and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, an FDI project secured for one Gateway can have a positive impact on other Gateways and their surrounding areas. It must be acknowledged, however, that the decision on where a client company will locate a new FDI investment is ultimately made by the senior managers of the companies involved.<\/p><p>  I am mindful of the concerns that have been expressed by Deputies on all sides of the House about the relatively low level of site visits to certain regional locations and have raised this matter with the CEO of IDA Ireland with a view to exploring what further initiatives can be taken to influence potential investors to invest in such locations. <\/p><p>  I am mindful, also, that in order to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for foreign direct investment, it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014, when IDA Ireland&rsquo;s current strategy is implemented. This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development. <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding these challenges, IDA Ireland has assured me that it will in 2013, in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, seek to target more than 130 new investments, secure &euro;500 million of R&amp;D expenditure and create 13,000 new jobs in its client companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600063#WRM02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consumer Protection","counter":2260,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600063#WRM02750"},{"type":"question","counter":2261,"qnumday":304,"qnumall":"[9635\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600063#WRM02800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the charges that can be applied to flights when booked by credit card; and if he will legislate to ban such practices.","asker":"959","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":2262,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s consultation paper of September 2012 on Article 19 (Fees for the use of means of payment) and Article 22 (Additional payments) of Directive 2011\/83\/EU on Consumer Right gives details of payment charges applied by a number of traders, including the charges applied by airlines referred to by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  Article 52(3) of Directive 2007\/64\/EC on Payment Services in the Internal Market states that a &lsquo;payment service provider shall not prevent the payee from requesting a charge or from offering a reduction for the use of a given payment instrument.&rsquo; Article 52(3) gave Member States discretion to &lsquo;forbid or limit the right to request charges taking into account the need to encourage competition and forbid the use of efficient payment instruments&rsquo;.

This initiative examined every role in the organisation for the purpose of highlighting operational changes that could be implemented to enhance delivery of key objectives; identifying areas of duplication that could be addressed by improved processes; as well as identifying areas where there was scope to introduce enhanced IT systems, thus giving the agency greater flexibility to relocate staff to client facing functions.<\/p><p>  Following that process, I understand that IDA Ireland retains two offices in the North East Region &ndash; an office in Cavan, with one full time role concentrating on client facing activities and an office in Dundalk, with one client facing role and one part time support role.

I am not in a position to reverse this decision.  While the Comprehensive Expenditure Review, 2012 to 2014, published in December 2011, provided for a reduction of a further &euro;540 million in expenditure by my Department in 2013, the Government was able to reduce the net savings required for this year to &euro;390 million.  This was &euro;150 million less than originally indicated.  This enabled the Government to ensure, for the second year in a row, that there was no reduction in primary weekly rates of payment.<\/p><p>  In 2013, the Department will spend almost &euro;20.3 billion on the wide range of schemes and services it operates.  Carers receive significant income supports from the Department, among the highest rates of income support in Europe.  Carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care), and the annual respite care grant in respect of each person for whom they care.  Such an annual payment, in a single lump sum with no requirement to satisfy a means test, is not available for any other group nor is there an equivalent payment for carers in any other country in Europe.  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their main social welfare payment and get the half-rate carer's allowance as well.  They can also receive an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person.<\/p><p>  The current rate of the respite care grant (&euro;1,375) remains significantly higher, and still more than double what it was in 2002 (&euro;635).  Expenditure on the grant has increased by 290% since 2005 from &euro;34.3 million to &euro;135 million in 2012.<\/p><p>  In relation to the next budget, the Deputy will be aware that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Expenditure Report 2013 published by Government last December provides for additional new expenditure reduction measures of &euro;440 million to be achieved in 2014 in the Department of Social Protection budget.  Reducing overall expenditure in 2014 in line with this target will be very challenging.  No decisions have been made at this stage as to how these targets will be met.

The sustainability of the pension system is a particular concern because of the demographic challenges Ireland faces, the associated increases in pension (and other age related) costs, and the deterioration in the public finances.  This means that, in the future, the task of financing increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population as demographic projections indicate the ratio of working age to older people will decrease from 5.3 to 1 at present to 2.1 to 1 by 2060.  Life expectancy in Ireland is also increasing and whilst this is very welcome development, it also presents very real and obvious public policy challenges. <\/p><p>  Discussions on long term pension policy identified the need for a short and focussed examination on the direction of policy to ensure a modern, sustainable, and adequate pension system taking into account the impact of the economic downturn.  It was in this regard that the OECD was commissioned to review long term pension policy in Ireland.  <\/p><p>  The particular aspects being considered by the OECD include:<\/p><p>- the sustainability of the pension system in the light of demographic and investment challenges;<\/p><p>- the adequacy and coverage levels, in order to ensure adequate income in retirement with a particular focus on the lower and middle income group;<\/p><p>- the modernity of pension systems to ensure flexibility in the labour market and supporting mechanisms for longer working;<\/p><p>- equity within the pension system.<\/p><p>  The review was initiated in April 2012. Since then, the OECD has engaged extensively with a range of Government departments, the social partners, older groups and representatives from the pensions industry.  A consultation forum including a wide range of stakeholders was held in Farmleigh House in September 2012. <\/p><p>  It is anticipated that the final OECD report, which will be used to inform government decisions in this area, will be presented to me in the coming weeks.

IFI actively promotes the potential of our inland fisheries resource, and on its establishment in 2010, set up a Business Development Division to further develop the potential of the inland fisheries sector with a special interest in promoting the tourism potential of the sector. IFI also works with Tourism Ireland to promote angling tourism.<\/p><p>  The following promotional activities are undertaken by IFI on a routine basis:<\/p><p>- Daily updates to the www.fishinginireland.info website with the latest information for anglers.  In 2012 80,000 referrals were made via the IFI website. Frequent updates to FACEBOOK and Twitter. FACEBOOK currently provides a reach to 750,000 individuals.<\/p><p>- Weekly publication and circulation of the IFI online magazine Angling Ezine in providing information on the best angling available in Ireland to a very wide group.<\/p><p>- Up to 15 Trade Shows are attended by IFI annually in Ireland, UK, Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and the US promoting Ireland as a prime angling tourism destination. <\/p><p>  In addition, IFI has produced a number of new angling guides, maps and leaflets, reprinted a number of guides and produced high quality promotional material. The most recent of these published are: <\/p><p>- Mayo Game Angling Guide<\/p><p>- Sligo Game Angling Guide<\/p><p>- Boyne Valley Angling Guide<\/p><p>- Lough O&rsquo;Flynn &amp; River Suck Angling Guide<\/p><p>- South West Angling Guide<\/p><p>  Guides are produced in hard copy and electronically and a number are available in French and or German. Staff in IFI support visiting angling journalists, up to 30 a year, in promoting the best of Irish angling through various articles and blogs in Irish, UK, European and US Press. <\/p><p>  In 2012 IFI commissioned a major survey of recreational angling in Ireland.  This important research focuses on domestic and overseas anglers, fish species of interest, estimates of expenditure and other data with a view to improving the quality of angling and to benchmark the Irish angling experience against competitor destinations. <\/p><p>  In addition IFI will shortly launch a revamped website and an angling App which will provide information on angling resources nationwide.  IFI also operates a pilot sponsorship programme and a large variety of events have been sponsored including major competitions such as the World Pairs, The Rosslare Small Boats Competition, The Dutch King of Clubs and the upcoming World Youth Fly Fishing Championship.  These events bring hundreds of visitors to Ireland. <\/p><p>  In addition to these direct measures, IFI is working with my Department on a major project to modernise, consolidate and simplify the law pertaining to inland fisheries, which is well advanced and which will serve the sector well into the future.  The review of legislation will go to public consultation in the near future.  A key overriding objective of this project is to put in place the legislative basis to allow IFI to develop the potential of the sector, mainly by increasing the number of anglers utilising the resource, empowering stakeholders to take an active role in the development of the resource and to maximise the returns from the inland fisheries resource to local communities and the State. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR00300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gas Exploration","counter":2499,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR00350"},{"type":"question","counter":2500,"qnumday":391,"qnumall":"[9735\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the latest reports and findings on unconventional gas exploration and extraction in Germany of November 2012 and the presentation given by Mr Helmut Fehr, Kreis Steinfurt, to local groups in County Leitrim last month in relation to the district of Steinfurt in Germany who have decided to meet the challenges related to the rising costs of energy and the upcoming shortage of fossil fuels and if he will outline from the information provided whether he would integrate this material into any further investigation of the Irish research (details supplied)","asker":"1082","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":2501,"qnumday":392,"qnumall":"[9736\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR00500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he proposes to explore the regional economic impact of hydrofracking and gas production here using the German model (details supplied) and the way his Department will deal with each issue raised.","asker":"1082","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2502,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 391 and 392 together.<\/p><p>  I understand that on 4th February, 2012, German politician and scientific advisor Helmut Fehr presented a talk at a public meeting in Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, on how fracking might affect rural areas.<\/p><p>  I understand that amongst other views, he expressed his belief that the Environmental Protection Agency should have the last word on whether fracking goes ahead and that its German counterpart is due to release a comprehensive report in November of this year.

Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis can be found on the website of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) at www.callcosts.ie.<\/p><p>  The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.<\/p><p>  The State only becomes involved in the provision of services in instances of clear market failure, such as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS).  My Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS.  The Scheme offers a basic broadband service, in line with EU State aid clearance, to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated Electoral Divisions.  In County Mayo, NBS services are available within 112 of its 154 Electoral Divisions.  The general area of Kilmovee was excluded from the NBS since at the time of mapping exercise carried out prior to the launch of the Scheme it was found to be served.  The NBS is prohibited under State Aid and competition rules from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.<\/p><p>  The RBS was launched in 2011 in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision.  This Scheme was aimed at making a basic broadband service available to un-served premises in rural areas, not already covered by the NBS.  Commercial service providers were in a position to offer services to all applicants from County Mayo under the Scheme who agreed to engage with them.<\/p><p>  In addition to consumer services, State-funded Metropolitan Area Networks which provide high capacity fibre connectivity for businesses and telecoms operators in the regions are located in Ballina, Ballinrobe, Belmullet, Claremorris, Kiltimagh and Knock in County Mayo.<\/p><p>  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013, and the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>  Specifically, it commits to:<\/p><p>- 70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015,<\/p><p>- At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population, and <\/p><p>- A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.<\/p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. <\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.<\/p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including County Mayo, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR00800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Transmission Network","counter":2506,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR00850"},{"type":"question","counter":2507,"qnumday":394,"qnumall":"[9807\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR00900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide details of any future plans by EirGrid to construct high-capacity transmission lines in western Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2508,"content":"<p>EirGrid&rsquo;s Grid25 programme is a strategy designed to develop the transmission networks in order to ensure safe, secure and affordable electricity supplies throughout Ireland supporting economic growth, renewable and sustainable energy.  The Government endorses this major investment programme currently underway in the high voltage electricity transmission system.  Grid25 is the most important investment in Ireland&rsquo;s transmission system for several generations and will position our energy system for decades to come.<\/p><p>  The transmission system in Ireland, managed and operated by EirGrid, consists of three voltage levels of high capacity lines.  It is operated at 400 kV, 220 kV and 110 kV.<\/p><p>  In 2012 significant progress was made in a number of Grid25 regions in relation to construction, uprating and refurbishment of over 200km of existing circuits and there is currently 2000 megawatts of wind power installed on the Island of Ireland.<\/p><p>  Significant progress has been made on the Grid West project since it was launched in May 2012 and extensive public consultation has occurred over the last 9 months.  The project will be moving to a key stage in the coming weeks with the publication of the Stage 1 Report which will indicate a number of potential corridors that can accommodate this new transmission line following all the information on the study area gathered today. EirGrid is encouraging anyone with an interest in the project to participate in the upcoming consultation. <\/p><p>  The Grid West project will initially consist of a new high capacity power line, but based on the region&rsquo;s renewable potential, it is envisaged that in time, a second line will be required.  The pace of installation of the second line is dependent on a number of factors including the speed at which further renewable energy generation is developed in the region. <\/p><p>  EirGrid is also developing a West Galway project consisting of a new 110kV electricity substation to allow renewable generation to connect to the transmission grid. The project calls for a new electrical substation to connect into a planned 110kV distribution line running from Salthill to Screeb, County Galway.  The project will increase security of energy supply to the region and enable Galway to be a net exporter of renewable energy.

Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis can be found on the website of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) at www.callcosts.ie.  Decisions by Eircom relating to investment in infrastructure to provide broadband services, including the upgrading of local exchanges, are taken purely on commercial grounds and as such are not one in which I have a statutory role.<\/p><p>  The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.<\/p><p>  The State only becomes involved in the provision of services in instances of clear market failure, such as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS).  My Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS.  The Scheme offers a basic broadband service, in line with EU State aid clearance, to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated Electoral Divisions.  In County Clare, NBS services are available within 49 of its 155 Electoral Divisions, including the general area of Lissycasey.  Fixed residences and businesses in the area can therefore apply for a broadband connection from &ldquo;3&rdquo; under the NBS.  Lissycasey is not covered under the RBS which was aimed at making a basic broadband service available to un-served premises in rural areas, not already covered by the NBS.<\/p><p>  In addition to consumer services, a State-funded Metropolitan Area Network which provides high capacity fibre connectivity for businesses and telecoms operators is located in Kilrush in County Clare.<\/p><p>  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013, and the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>  Specifically, it commits to:<\/p><p>- 70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015,<\/p><p>- At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population, and<\/p><p>- A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.<\/p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. <\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.<\/p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including County Clare, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR01300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Transmission Network","counter":2513,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR01350"},{"type":"question","counter":2514,"qnumday":400,"qnumall":"[9879\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if there are any plans for the development of an electricity interconnector between Ireland and mainland Europe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1092","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2515,"content":"<p>Security of energy supply is a key imperative for Ireland and the European Union.

In Ireland and across Europe, the digital economy is considered to be a key enabler for stability, jobs, growth and social inclusion.  For this reason, as chair of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council, I have prioritised a number of initiatives that support the implementation of the Digital Single Market and the Digital Agenda for Europe.<\/p><p>  An important goal in this regard is to progress the legislative proposal for a pan-European electronic ID, authentication and signature framework.  This is a key enabler for a properly functioning EU digital market.  The proposed regulation is technically complex and Ireland aims to comprehensively address the many important concerns raised by Member States during its Presidency with a view to producing a comprehensive Progress Report for Council next June.<\/p><p>  In tandem with this initiative, Ireland has prioritised the delivery of measures to enhance trust in online services.  Trust and security in online transactions is essential so that both consumers and businesses can make secure, simple and inexpensive online transactions.  As Presidency, Ireland is therefore seeking to deliver real progress on the recently published proposals for a comprehensive EU Cyber Security Strategy as well as legislation relating to network and information security.<\/p><p>  These cyber security proposals will build on earlier initiatives to enhance trust and security. Earlier this month, the Irish Presidency negotiated the first agreement under the Irish Presidency on a renewed mandate for the workings of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA).<\/p><p>  The rollout of advanced high speed broadband is a key priority across Europe and another important pillar of the Digital Agenda for Europe. In Ireland, we have published a National Broadband Plan which aims to deliver early on some of the key targets under the Digital Agenda for Europe.  As Presidency we await with interest, proposals from the Commission in relation to reducing the cost of high speed broadband rollout which we believe will resonate with some of the actions identified in Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, and on which we hope to commence dialogue during our Presidency. <\/p><p>  All of these initiatives are designed to improve and encourage access for citizens, communities and business, thus enabling a more digitally empowered society and creating opportunities for growth.  The proposed Directive on the Re-use of Public Sector Information, is aimed at creating such opportunities and Ireland hopes to shortly conclude an agreement with the European Parliament on this issue.  The Directive allows for increased availability of public sector information which can be re-used for commercial and non-commercial purposes.<\/p><p>  Making information more widely accessible across society is also a key objective and under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency, the Council has started examining legislative proposals on the accessibility of public sector websites.<\/p><p>  The recent MFF negotiations significantly impacted on the financial envelope available to the telecoms element of the Connecting Europe Facility.  The telecoms Working Party will consider the most appropriate way forward on this initiative once the vote of the European Parliament on the budget is known.<\/p><p>  Finally, the Digital Agenda Assembly will be held in Dublin next June.  My officials are working closely with the Commission to shape the event which will emphasise digital skills and entrepreneurship.  The theme of the event will be heavily influenced by the recently published mid-term review of the Digital Agenda which highlighted the fact that ICT can contribute to a paradigm shift in society and economic activity through more efficiency, new products and services and smarter public services.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR02500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies","counter":2531,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR02525"},{"type":"question","counter":2532,"qnumday":406,"qnumall":"[10161\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR02600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide details of the payment of bonuses or other performance related payments and or allowances made to the staff of agencies under the aegis of his Department with a yearly breakdown from 2008 outlining the overall amount paid in each year period and the number of staff that received such payments and or allowances.","asker":"1001","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":2533,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[10178\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR02700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide details of payments made to the CEO or equivalent of all agencies under the aegis of his Department including details of any bonuses, pension entitlements or any other remuneration paid to him or her in 2012.","asker":"1001","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2534,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 406 and 407 together. <\/p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the information sought regarding payments made to CEOs and staff in the agencies under the aegis of my Department is an operational matter for each Agency.<\/p><p>  All directions issued by the Government in relation to remuneration of CEOs in Semi State Companies have been brought to the attention of the relevant State Companies.<\/p><p>  In so far as the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to staff subordinate to the CEO, these are matters solely for the agency in question. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR02800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Radio Broadcasting","counter":2535,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR02850"},{"type":"question","counter":2536,"qnumday":408,"qnumall":"[10262\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR02900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to deal with the following situation, seven out of ten minutes of listening time in Ireland is given to the 34 private radio stations here and at the same time taxpayer's money only goes to our national broadcasters, the JNLR figures show that 2.5 million listeners listen to independent radio stations whereas 1.2 million listen to our national stations, the action he will take to deal with this anomaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2537,"content":"<p>As I have stated previously in this House, I fully recognise the contribution of the independent radio sector in bringing diversity to the airwaves, and serving the needs of communities, often at a very local level.

Moreover, in many cases, their success in the licence application process was assisted by the voluntary commitments they gave in regard to the provision of public service type content, over and above that required by the relevant legislation.  The licences were accepted in full knowledge of the current system of public funding.  The fact that some of these stations are now undergoing an understandable degree of financial stress does not mean that the State should immediately step in and provide funding &ndash; they are and remain commercial enterprises.<\/p><p>  Moreover, it should also be noted that their very popularity in the communities they serve is, in many cases, as a distinct result of the local news content and current affairs type programming that they provide and which, in turn, gives them a strong advertising presence and thus earning potential.<\/p><p>  The rationale for providing State funding for the Public Service Broadcasters is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their public service objects while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence.  This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.<\/p><p>  The overall aim of Public Service Broadcasting is to provide services and content which cater for all interests in society, while ensuring that the varied elements of Irish culture and its intrinsic values are protected.  Through the obligations placed on the Public Service Broadcasters, which are established in legislation passed by the Oireachtas, and the criteria set for the funding of content through the Sound &amp; Vision Scheme, the production of quality indigenous programming and the production of minority interest programming is strongly promoted.<\/p><p>  I am, of course, willing to consider proposals from other broadcasting organisations in relation to the future distribution of funding.

In line with its legislative obligations, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is currently undertaking a review of the adequacy or otherwise of the public funding provided to the public service broadcasters.  In this context, I have asked the BAI to consider as part of this review the potential impacts to these broadcasters if television licence receipts were further distributed to the independent broadcasting sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR03000","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Provision","counter":2538,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR03050"},{"type":"question","counter":2539,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[10267\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR03100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the reason his Department&rsquo;s website is misleading in relation to the delivering of broadband to certain parts of County Longford, as it states that broadband is available in areas where in fact, it is not; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2540,"content":"<p>In terms of telecommunications policy, my Department plays a key role in providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment within which competition can flourish and private sector investment can take place.

Ireland is now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband in Ireland which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.<\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  This will ensure that citizens or businesses, wherever they are located, have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business in a global digital environment.<\/p><p>I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to in the Plan, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including County Longford, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR03200","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Prices","counter":2541,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR03250"},{"type":"question","counter":2542,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[10329\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR03300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which directly or in consultation with the regulator, he and or his Department continues to monitor the prices charged by oil companies for petrol and diesel; if the current prices charged reflect a reduction in accordance with the fall in oil prices on world markets over the past four years; if any reason has been given for relatively high prices now being charged at filling stations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":2543,"qnumday":411,"qnumall":"[10330\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR03400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if any discussions have taken place, directly or at EU level, with a view to ensuring that oil price reductions on world markets are passed on to the consumer with particular reference to the need to lower energy costs, as a prelude to economic recovery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":2544,"qnumday":412,"qnumall":"[10331\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR03500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which comparisons have been made between energy prices here and those applicable in Europe and worldwide with a view to ensuring that the domestic and industrial consumer here can avail of lower international oil prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2545,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 410 to 412, inclusive, together. <\/p><p>  Neither I nor the Commission for Energy Regulation have a statutory function in the monitoring or regulation of petrol and diesel prices. <\/p><p>  The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and de-regulated and there is free entry to the market.  There is no price control and it is Government policy to encourage price competition and consumer choice. <\/p><p>  The upward trend in petrol and diesel prices arises primarily from increases in international commodity prices over which Ireland has no control.  For example, the benchmark spot price of a barrel of Brent Crude Oil has risen from an average of US$43 in February 2009 to an average of US$117 in February 2013.  This has inevitably resulted in an increase in retail petrol and diesel prices.<\/p><p>  Previous surveys have shown that prices charged by Irish retailers for oil products relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil.  Prices at the pump reflect volatile market prices, transportation costs, trends in euro\/dollar exchange rates and other operating costs, together with the impact of taxation on oil products.<\/p><p>  The EU Market Observatory publishes an Oil Bulletin with current and historical oil product prices for all EU countries.<\/p><p>  As of February 11th 2013, the price of petrol in Ireland was marginally below the EU average; while the price of diesel was 4.8% higher than the EU average.<\/p><p>  If duties and taxes are stripped out then the price of petrol in Ireland was 98.5% of the EU average; and the price of diesel was less than 1% higher than the EU average.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about high oil prices are shared at EU level and fellow Member Countries of the International Energy Agency (IEA).  The EU and IEA agree that high fossil fuel prices, which pose a threat to economic recovery, underline the need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels by radically enhanced energy efficiency measures and the development of renewable energy.<\/p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme incentivises and enables the sustainable growth of an Irish biofuels market. The Scheme currently requires that the amount of biofuel brought to the market is not less than 6.38% of petroleum road transport fuels.  In 2011 some 145 million litres of biofuel were brought to the Irish market.<\/p><p>  The development of electric vehicles offers potential for Ireland to use cheaper grid sourced electricity, an increasing amount of which is sourced from renewable resources.<\/p><p>These opportunities will progressively reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels for transport, while supporting energy competitiveness and security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600068#WRR03600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Provision","counter":2547,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRS00250"},{"type":"question","counter":2548,"qnumday":413,"qnumall":"[10332\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRS00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which standard, quality and speed of broadband here currently compares with the best available worldwide; his plans to maximise this country's position in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2549,"content":"<p>There has been significant growth in the take up of broadband services and contracted speeds in Ireland in recent years.  The most recent telecommunications data report by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), reveals that the number of broadband subscribers has more than doubled to over 1.6 million between 2007 and  2012.  Similarly, in the case of speeds, the number of residential customers contracted in a range between 2 &ndash; 10 Mbps  increased from 41% of all subscribers in 2007 to 71% in 2012. The number of subscribers accessing speeds exceeding 10 Mbps increased from 0.2% to 24%.<\/p><p>  EU and international comparisons of broadband services are complex to measure and interpret. For example, OECD surveys calculate an average of all advertised broadband speeds. The average speed reduces if there is a significant choice of products advertised at these lower speeds. In addition OECD calculations do not differentiate between services that are available nationally and services which are available in selected areas. Similarly, EU Commission statistics published on its digital scoreboard website, compare advertised versus actual speeds and are based on 2011 data. Comparisons between countries do not take account of distinct geographical and demographic challenges that face countries such as Ireland where the population is highly dispersed. <\/p><p>  EU Commission statistics, published on its digital scoreboard website, which compare advertised broadband speeds across the EU notes that  84% of subscribers in Ireland access speeds in a range between 2-10 Mbps compared to the EU average of 87% in this range.  In the case of speeds at or exceeding 10 Mbps, the EU Commission reports 29% availability over fixed lines in Ireland compared to an EU average of 48%. In the most recently available OECD data, Ireland&rsquo;s penetration is ranked 13th in terms of wireless connections and 25th   in terms of fixed line connections. The average speed reported by OECD for Ireland is 23 Mbps compared to an OECD average closer to 45 Mbps. Other international studies rank Ireland well in terms of actual speeds experienced by users. <\/p><p>  The more recent ComReg report notes an overall trend of customers contracting at higher speeds.  The proportion of customers contracting at or below 2 Mbps fell from 7% - to 5% of all subscriptions between 2011 and 2012. Increasingly, subscribers are contracting at speeds in excess of 10Mbps. <\/p><p>  Recent market developments are dramatically changing the landscape of high speed broadband provision in Ireland. During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The commercial sector is already committed to investments of the order of some &euro;1bn and is accelerating its investment to deliver broadband speeds of 30Mbps to 150Mbps to homes and businesses.  For example:<\/p><p>- Eircom is currently investing up to &euro;500m in a phased deployment of fibre to the cabinet infrastructure, which is planned to make high-speed broadband available to some 1.2m premises.  The network has already reached more than 230,000 premises and is expected to be launched over the coming months;<\/p><p>- UPC is investing &euro;500m in its cable and fibre network, which is delivering speeds of up to 150Mbps.  UPC aims to have this service available to 700,000 homes by 2015;<\/p><p>- Mobile telecommunications operators will be rolling out advanced mobile broadband products in 2013, following the recent multi-band spectrum auction. <\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.

It is the case however, that Ireland in the main, is at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices which dictate the retail price of electricity and gas, which is the key factor in the retail price of both electricity and gas. In particular, Ireland is a price taker for gas.  Global gas and oil prices have risen sharply since the start of 2011 driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan and demand from emerging economies of China and India.  There are clear indications that international oil and gas prices will rise further over the coming months.  The Government remains firmly committed to increasing competition as the best means of exerting downward pressure on energy prices, and also towards ensuring diversity of energy supply to reduce our exposure to high and volatile external energy prices.  This dependence on imported gas also underlines the need to promote and invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency.<\/p><p>  Effective procurement of energy services can also lead to significant organisational savings. My Department is working closely with private and public stakeholders on a National Energy Performance Contracting Policy Framework (the Framework) to help companies procure energy-related services including energy efficiency retrofits, energy supply and behavioural improvements. Recent experience from programmes run by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland demonstrates the substantial monetary benefits that good procurement can deliver. I expect to be in a position to publish the draft Framework within the next two months.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s demand for gas is met almost entirely by imports across the gas interconnectors from Great Britain.  The vast bulk of UK gas demand is currently being met by indigenous North Sea production and imports from Norway.  Through the gas interconnectors Ireland has access to diverse sources of supply including UK indigenous production, Norwegian production and physical interconnection with mainland Europe.  It is prudent, in light of Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on gas imported from the UK, to work to reduce our reliance on this source.  Bringing Corrib gas production on stream will further reduce our reliance on imports. <\/p><p>  The European Commission recognises that Europe needs an internal energy market that is competitive and integrated with electricity and gas flowing where and when it is needed.  The EU aims to fully integrate national energy markets to give consumers and businesses more and better products and services, more competition, and more secure supplies.  In this regard I welcome the recent progress made on the SEM Market Integration Project, within the context that implementing the European Target Model is a positive development that will bring significant benefits to the consumers and producers of electricity on the island of Ireland.  Of course actual physical cross border trading of electricity is only possibe to the extent that interconnectors can accommodate it and accordingly I welcome the recent completion of construction by EirGrid of the East West Interconnector(EWIC) a strategically vital infrastructure project.<\/p><p>  I presided, last Friday, over the European Energy Council as part of Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency and among the issues on the agenda was the Commission Communication on completion of the Internal Energy Market.

Indeed this matter is also the subject of a fundamental debate at EU and national level at present, a fact reflected by the recent decision of the Joint Oireachtas Committee to examine the issue.<\/p><p>  As Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I have policy responsibility for providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment to facilitate the development of high quality communications infrastructure and services.  However, I should highlight that I do not have sole responsibility for addressing as to how that infrastructure is used.  Responsibility, in the context of abuse over the Internet in particular, also sits with the Minister for Justice and Equality, and the executive agency of his Department, the Office for Internet Safety.<\/p><p>  It is clear that there are no simple answers to the challenges posed by the development and abuse of social media, not least because of the international basis of the services and because any possible policy responses fall across a range of Government Departments.  In recognition of this complexity my Department maintains open and regular contact with all Departments and State Agencies with responsibilities in this area.<\/p><p>  My Department also monitors international developments with a view to ensuring that domestic policy within its remit reflects best practice and that the regulatory framework is amended as necessary. In that regard, I look forward to the deliberations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications, and I also look forward to meeting the Committee on this subject.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRS01600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postal Services","counter":2568,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRS01650"},{"type":"question","counter":2569,"qnumday":420,"qnumall":"[10341\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRS01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent, if any, to which he continues to have contact with An Post with a view to ensuring the maintenance of the post office and services network and next day delivery throughout the country without exception; if alternative, complementary and or compatible services such as banking continue to be attracted by An Post with a view to ensuring its long term viability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2570,"content":"<p>Operational matters in relation to the post office network are a matter for the management and Board of An Post and one in which I have no statutory function.<\/p><p>  As shareholder, however, I have a strong concern in relation to the ongoing commercial position of the Company and I regularly liaise with the Company in this regard.<\/p><p>  An Post has many strengths and has the largest retail presence in the country.

This was a historic meeting as it marked the first under new universal membership arrangements for UNEP agreed in &quot;The Future We Want&quot; document at the Rio +20 Conference held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in June 2012. Environment nisters attending the Session backed decisions designed to ensure a strengthened and upgraded institution that will be able to meet the environmental challenges of the 21st century. This  was the first major restructuring of UNEP since it was founded four decades ago. The negotiations in Nairobi were challenging, particularly in relation to the new institutional arrangements and it fell to the Irish Presidency to coordinate the EU&#8217;s input to these negotiations. <\/p><p>The Irish Presidency team&#8217;s co-ordination role involved managing multiple parallel tracks of meetings and participating in a number of bi-lateral meetings with other non-EU delegations during the Session.  Following agreement on all the major decisions tabled, the Irish Presidency on behalf of the EU and its Member States welcomed the outcome of the Session. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Ministerial segment took place over the first three days of the Session during which I and fellow nisters discussed a range of issues including the key priority of Institutional Reform of UNEP, Sustainable Development Goals, and the Green Economy . In addition, the Governing Council took a number of other decisions across a range of themes including on sustainable consumption and production, green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, chemicals and waste and UNEP&#8217;s Programme of Work and Budget. Further details on the negotiations and outcomes of the meeting are available at <i><i>.<\/i><\/i><i><\/i>On the eve of the Governing Council I addressed a High Level international meeting on the Rule of Law and the Environment which brought together nisters of the Environment and Government representatives with representatives of the judicial, legal and auditing professions.   <\/p><p><br \/>  I attended and spoke at round table discussions on emerging policy issues in the area of the environment and also attended lunchtime discussions, hosted by the Executive Director of UNEP, Mr. Achim Steiner, on the Green Economy. I also outlined, in my Presidency role, key EU priorities and concerns on the institutional arrangements for UNEP being discussed at the Session. In addition, I attended and spoke on behalf of the EU at a Ministerial Breakfast hosted by the German nistry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, for key players in the negotiations. I also attended a reception hosted by the Head of the EU delegation in Nairobi at which Sustainable Development Goals were discussed.   <\/p><p><br \/>  While at the Governing Council I also took the opportunity to have a number of bilateral meetings. I met with the Executive Director of UNEP to discuss a number of issues including the key issues before the Session, Ireland&#8217;s Presidency of the EU in the context of the Informal Environment Council which takes place in Dublin on 22\/23 April next and issues relating to the GEMS Water Programme, which is the primary source for global water quality data and information.

I also met with Mr. Janez Potocnik, EU Commissioner for the Environment, to review EU priorities and the state of play in negotiations during the Governing Council and co-chaired, with Commissioner Potocnik, a meeting with representatives of major groups and civil society. During the negotiations, I also chaired two meetings of EU nisters and Heads of Delegations to agree EU priorities as discussions moved into a critical phase. Commissioner Potocnik and I also took the opportunity to meet, on a bilateral basis, with Environment Ministers from a number of Latin American countries - Columbia, Mexico, Bolivia and Brazil - to discuss key issues during the Session, principally in relation to sustainable development goals, the green economy and resource efficiency. <\/p><p><br \/>  In the margins of the Governing Council, and in accordance with normal practice, I attended a reception hosted by Ireland&#8217;s Honorary Consul at which I met members of the Irish Community in Kenya and Irish officials from UNEP involved in preparations for the 27th session.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRT00800","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Control of Dogs","counter":2621,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRT00825"},{"type":"question","counter":2622,"qnumday":438,"qnumall":"[9693\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRT00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide an update on recent contact with farming representatives regarding the promotion of responsible dog ownership, particularly in order to reduce the level of sheep worrying taking place in rural areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2623,"content":"<p>Both I and my Department met recently with representatives of the Irish Farming Association as part of on-going discussions regarding dog control issues in general and instances of sheep worrying in particular.<\/p><p>  As a direct result of these discussions both my Department and the Irish Farmers Association issued press releases regarding the spate of serious dog attacks on sheep which occurred earlier in the year.

Under section 10 of the Act, a fire authority is required to make provision for the delivery of fire services in its functional area, including the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of premises. <\/p><p>  The embargo on the filling of posts in the Local Government Service was introduced on 24 March 2009 following a Government Decision to implement savings measures across the wider public service.   <\/p><p>  My Department received a delegated sanction from the Department of Finance in August 2009 for implementation of this general moratorium on the filling of public sector posts across all local authorities.   <\/p><p>  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each County and City Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible. In this regard, it is a matter for County and City managers, in the first instance, to ensure that the reduction in staff numbers is managed so that the appropriate service level is maintained within budgetary and staffing constraints.   <\/p><p>  Where vacancies arise, local authorities must consider all options for reorganisation and reallocation of work to meet requirements.\u00a0 Any exceptions to the moratorium require sanction from my Department. <\/p><p>  All staffing sanction requests are examined on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services and the need further to reduce overall staffing levels in the local authority sector. My Department works closely with local authorities to ensure that key posts are filled.

In determining an application for the opening of an insolvency proceeding, for which it would have exclusive power as the primary proceedings, of a company or of a natural person, the Regulation requires that a court should determine the centre of main interest (COMI) of the applicant in the context of  assuming jurisdiction.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is a matter for the court to satisfy itself that the provisions in its national law in this regard have been observed.  For example, the UK Courts can and have refused or revoked insolvency proceedings where an abuse has been detected. Indeed, this has occurred with certain individuals, who were subsequently subject to insolvency proceedings in this jurisdiction. <\/p><p><br \/>  A company or natural person is entitled to change a COMI and could do so for the purposes, <i>inter-alia<\/i>   of taking advantage of more favourable insolvency legislation. This entitlement arises under the broad rubric of freedom of movement in the Internal Market and such freedom has been enforced by decisions of the European Court of Justice. The country in which the debts are incurred is not necessarily material, but the relocation must not be artificial. The question of COMI is determined at the date the application for the insolvency proceeding is made and not at the time the debts were incurred. Orders made in insolvency proceedings in another EU jurisdiction, including an order discharging a person from bankruptcy, are enforceable against creditors elsewhere in the EU. <\/p><p><br \/>  In response to the economic downturn across Europe, the EU has published a proposal to modernise cross-border insolvency law which seeks to make cross-border insolvency proceedings more efficient, benefiting both debtors and creditors throughout the EU.  One of the primary aims of the new Regulation will be to give potentially viable companies and entrepreneurs a second chance before being declared insolvent. The proposal also addresses a range of other insolvency issues. <\/p><p><br \/>  I arranged that the initial discussion on the proposed Regulation took place at the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting of EU Justice Ministers held in Dublin Castle on the 17 and 18 of January last. The Ministers, including my British colleague, engaged in a very detailed and constructive discussion on the proposals contained in the Regulation. I emphasised the importance of a more uniform approach across the EU in regard to the establishment of the centre of main interest so as to combat potential abuses in this regard which have given rise to allegations of &quot;bankruptcy tourism&quot;. <\/p><p><br \/>  Detailed consideration of the provisions contained in the new draft Regulation has now  commenced in a Working Group chaired by the Irish Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRV02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tribunals of Inquiry","counter":2754,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRV02050"},{"type":"question","counter":2755,"qnumday":488,"qnumall":"[9768\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRV02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 153 of 12 December 2012, the progress made on the recommendations of the Moriarty Tribunal;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2756,"content":"<p>As stated in my reply on 12 December 2012, insofar as the report of the Moriarty Tribunal made recommendations concerning the future operation of tribunals of inquiry, many of these recommendations are anticipated by the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005 which awaits Report Stage debate in the D&aacute;il.

The Board prioritises certain categories of cases and these cases will receive an immediate or near immediate service.  The main categories of case types that are prioritised are public law child care cases, child abduction cases and domestic violence cases.  In addition, the Board has been piloting a triage approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in a number of law centres.  The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times.  The aim of the triage approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes).  If the applicant requires further services they remain on the waiting list.  There is or has been a backlog of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Board is taking other steps in an effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery including introducing a new case management system in its law centres, integrating its mediation and legal services, integrating its Refugee Legal Service into the general law centre service delivery model and maintaining a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court.  The reality is that the Board must live within its budget and is subject to the public service recruitment moratorium (there is a very limited derogation).  Demand for the Board's services has increased significantly since the downturn in the economy.  There was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011.  However, demand in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006.  The capacity to provide a meaningful service is a priority for the Board.  In 2013, the Board will examine other options in an effort to enable legal services to be provided promptly to those most in need of them.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to Criminal Legal Aid, total expenditure for 2012 came to &#8364;50.5 million, a reduction of 10% over the 2011 figure of &#8364;56.1 million.  This reduction in the annual expenditure is the largest ever recorded and represents a fall of approximately &#8364;10 million, or 16%, over the peak recorded in 2009.  As the Scheme is demand led it is difficult to predict and control expenditure because it depends on the number of criminal cases coming before the courts.  The Task Force on Cost Reductions on Criminal Legal Aid identified a range of measures which could potentially contribute to costs reductions in this area.  As I stated in the Topical Issues debate referred to in the Deputy's question, a requirement on applicants to make an initial payment could give rise to constitutional difficulties and difficulties arising from the European Convention on Human Rights.  It would not be feasible to introduce arrangements which give rise to further administrative expense and demands on resources for no real benefit.  A new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is planned to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, <i>inter alia<\/i>, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions must have regard to a person's rights to the presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to be given legal aid, where appropriate.  I hope it will be possible to publish the Bill during the course of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRW01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service","counter":2777,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRW01450"},{"type":"question","counter":2778,"qnumday":495,"qnumall":"[9910\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRW01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the total amount spent on outsourced security services in the Court Services for 2012; and if he will provide details of the companies providing these services.","asker":"1032","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":2779,"qnumday":496,"qnumall":"[9911\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRW01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the total amount spent on outsourced cleaning services in the Court Services for 2012; and if he will provide details of the companies providing these services.; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1032","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2780,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 495 and 496 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions, including the provision and maintenance of accommodation for court sittings.

All States operate immigration controls for well established reasons of public policy, including considerations of an economic nature which in the case of Ireland remains extremely challenging with ongoing high levels of unemployment. There are also considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account.<\/p><p>  Legal and illegal migration are two sides of the same coin and a balanced policy needs to facilitate regular migration channels while at the same time take action against immigration abuse.  Many people from overseas have made Ireland their home in recent years.  In this context it is worth noting that many of the EU citizens who arrived here during times of economic prosperity have chosen to remain notwithstanding the change in economic circumstances.  In addition, many individuals have been granted citizenship in recent years.  Over the past two years alone, approximately 38,000 individuals have successfully applied for and been successful in their citizenship applications, approximately 13,000 in 2011 and approximately 25,000 in 2012. <\/p><p>  Of course, citizenship is not the only means of attaining lawful residence in the State.  For example, through an accrual of employment permits an individual may choose to apply for long term residence, or to continue to renew his or her status on an annual basis. Tens of thousands of immigrants have remained on in the State on foot of such provisions.<\/p><p>  Clearly, all illegal immigrant cases are not the same and must be dealt with on a case by case basis and on the basis of their individual circumstances.  At one end of the scale are those where the person's illegal status is through no fault of their own and indeed my Department has been dealing with cases of this nature on an ongoing basis.  However there are also much more egregious instances of immigration abuse, often at considerable expense to the State and it does not follow that such persons should profit from their conduct. <\/p><p>  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.<\/p><p>  In looking at cases as they arise, among the issues that would be relevant to the outcome would be the circumstances in which the person became undocumented, the length of time they have been in that situation, their prospects of being able to gain lawful employment without being a drain on the financial resources of the State along with the more general considerations applicable to immigration decisions, including any family related rights they may have in the context of the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p><p>  Sometimes case by case consideration will result in a positive outcome for the applicant.  However, in other cases this may result in a decision by the Irish authorities, subject to the oversight of our Courts, that the person has to go home.  That decision should be respected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRX01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Offences","counter":2811,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRX01450"},{"type":"question","counter":2812,"qnumday":507,"qnumall":"[10043\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRX01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of holders of category W driving licences that have been convicted for towing a trailer on a work vehicle or land tractor in each of the years 2010, 2011 and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2813,"content":"<p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.

It is a matter for the court to satisfy itself that the provisions in its national law in this regard have been observed. For example, the UK Courts can and have refused or revoked insolvency proceedings where an abuse has been detected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRX02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Aid Service Expenditure","counter":2832,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRX02850"},{"type":"question","counter":2833,"qnumday":514,"qnumall":"[10124\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRX02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the amount of funding that was given to Free Legal Aid for the periods 2010, 2011 and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2834,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that my Department made available the sum of &euro;98,000 to the Free Legal Advice Centres (FLAC) in each of the years 2010, 2011 and 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRX03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sentencing Policy","counter":2835,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRX03050"},{"type":"question","counter":2836,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[10132\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRX03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans for establishing sentencing guidelines; if he intends to set up a sentencing council; the discussions he has held with the LRC on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2837,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that judges are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  In accordance with this principle, the role of the Oireachtas has been to specify in law a maximum penalty and a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.<\/p><p>  There are, of course, a small number of situations where statute has created exceptions to this approach most notably by providing for mandatory sentences for murder and presumptive minimum sentences in the case of certain firearms and drug trafficking offences.  Except for exceptional circumstances, I am of the view that the Oireachtas should be cautious in prescribing mandatory sentences.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient. The Law Reform Commission is currently examining the law in relation to mandatory sentences and I understand that this work will be completed this year.<\/p><p>  It would not be in keeping with the principles of judicial independence for the Executive to impose a Sentencing Council on the Judiciary. For similar reasons, the Deputy may be aware that the Law Reform Commission, after detailed study some years ago, recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines but favoured non-statutory sentencing principles.  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  Information on over 1,000 cases is detailed on the website and I welcome the committee's recent announcement that two JobBridge interns are to be appointed shortly in order to recommence populating the online database with information on sentencing in the criminal courts. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that the ISIS committee announced they are planning to recommence providing information on sentencing in relation to specific issues in which context an analysis has been published on rape sentencing prepared by the Judicial Researchers Office under the guidance of Mr. Justice Peter Charleton.  I understand that seminars are also planned, including one focusing on the work of the Sentencing Council in the UK.<\/p><p>Finally, in September 2012, I announced a strategic review of penal policy. I have established a working group to carry out this review which will examine all aspects of penal policy and I expect the Group to report later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRX03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport","counter":2838,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRX03250"},{"type":"question","counter":2839,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[10139\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRX03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 129 of 7 February 2013, of the 31 patrol vehicles allocated to the Tipperary Division if he will provide a breakdown by district of the number of these cars that are operated by the Traffic Corps within their division; the number that are used solely for patrol purposes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2840,"content":"<p>Decisions in relation to the provision and deployment of Garda transport are matters for the Garda Commissioner.

These proposals also draw heavily from the regulatory and practise models of England and Wales which do not always correspond to those of our jurisdiction nor to those set out under current Government policy in the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011.  Under Section 30 of the Bill, provision is already made for public consultation in relation to the creation of a new profession of conveyancer.

It is one of 6 Fishery Harbour Centres operated by the State, each of whose primary purpose is to provide facilities and services for the fishing industry and fisheries-related activities.  <\/p><p>  There has been significant capital investment in the Fishery Harbour Centres in recent years, underpinning both the fisheries side and, in parallel, their expanding use for leisure and marine tourism and other maritime enterprises.  Howth in particular has a long tradition in both areas.  All of the users of the Fishery Harbour need to be accommodated in a safe and secure facility, and the Department has a duty of care towards anyone entering it.  Apart from any other considerations, the upkeep of the Harbour so that it meets with current health and safety standards has a cost and this cost must be paid for out of the income generated. <\/p><p>  In the current economic climate, the State must be fully committed to maximising the return on its investment.  Furthermore, my Department is required to ensure that the Fishery Harbour Centres are run on a financially sound basis.  <\/p><p>  With over 500 parking spaces within the boundaries of the Fishery Harbour Centre at present, it is clear that a significant source of revenue exists that could assist in balancing the books, and providing funding for enhancements that would not otherwise be possible.<\/p><p>  I am reviewing all aspects of the matter at present.  I can assure the Deputy that the views of the various harbour users, the potential earnings, the possible impact on the harbour businesses and recreational users, the impact on the local economy, the impact on overall traffic management within the Fishery Harbour, are all matters that I will take into account in coming to a decision. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRZ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Afforestation Programme","counter":2951,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRZ02950"},{"type":"question","counter":2952,"qnumday":559,"qnumall":"[9640\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRZ03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding an afforestation application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2953,"content":"<p>The application for pre-planting approval submitted by the person named is located within a Special Protection Area (SPA) designated for the protection of the hen harrier.

Up to that point there was no basis for any action.  My Department was requested on 21st   December by the FSAI to obtain samples of raw ingredients in the context of the FSAI survey on the authenticity of meat products, preliminary results of which indicated traces of non-bovine DNA.

I would point out, however, that the Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to enact legislation to regulate certain practices in the grocery goods sector.  The Government intends to give effect to this commitment by including an enabling provision in the legislation currently being prepared to merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, which will allow for the introduction of a statutory Code of Practice.  Work on drafting the Consumer and Competition Bill is on-going and the Bill is included in the &ldquo;A list&rdquo; in the Government&rsquo;s current Legislative Programme.  It is important to point out that in introducing a statutory Code the intention is not to protect one stakeholder over another nor is the Code intended to prevent stakeholders such as retailers and suppliers from engaging in the type of contractual negotiations that happen in most other sectors of the economy.  It is also the case that the Code is not seeking in any way to determine the price of grocery goods. Rather, the essential value of the Code is that by regulating problematic practices in the grocery goods sector it seeks to strike a fair balance between the competing interests of the various stakeholders including the interests of the end user, the consumer.<\/p><p>  The Government is strongly of the view that it important to ensure there is balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector and that Ireland continues to have strong agri food and retail sectors, particularly given the importance of these sectors to the national economy.  The introduction of a Code of Practice, as provided for in the Programme for Government, is intended to achieve such a balance taking into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector.  It must also be noted, however, that arrangements in the domestic market are not the primary influence on farmers&rsquo; incomes.  Unsurprisingly, with an Agri-Food industry that exported over &euro;9bn of goods last year, the bulk of most Irish farmers&rsquo; produce is exported (e.g. 4 out of 5 beef cattle produced in Ireland are consumed in other countries), so EU and world prices have a much bigger influence on the price farmers receive for their output overall than does the retail price in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRAA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":2991,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRAA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":2992,"qnumday":572,"qnumall":"[9710\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRAA01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when the agri environment options scheme 1 payment will be made available to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2993,"content":"<p>The person named was approved for participation in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme with effect from the 1st September 2010 and full payments totalling &euro;608.11 and &euro;4,195.14 issued in respect of 2010 and 2011 respectively.

An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is working to address this issue, particularly as oil prices increase and the cost of sending trawlers full of fish to Spain, France, Scotland and Norway becomes less economical.  With the increase in the Blue whiting quota for 2013, it is anticipated that there will be increased levels of this stock landed into Ireland by foreign vessels.  I understand that negotiations are ongoing between representatives of the French fishing industry and Irish processing interests, with a view to increasing French landings into Ireland.  A pilot initiative was developed between BIM, Irish processors and French industry during late 2012.  All concerned are seeking to build on the success of this initiative in 2013.<\/p><p>  In relation to official controls carried out by the SFPA these are done in order to discharge Ireland's obligations under the Framework for the control of the Common Fisheries Policy in EU Waters  as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1224\/2009, establishing a Community control system to ensure compliance with the rules of the CFP and Council Regulation (EC) No 1005\/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.  Detailed rules for the implementation of the control regulation are set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404\/2011, and I have implemented these in national law through Statutory Instrument 320 of 2012 as amended.  This is the regulatory EU framework against which the SFPA carries out its inspection regime.<\/p><p>  These regulations contain an explicit default obligation requiring that all fish be weighed by operators at the point of landing.  In order to ensure a reasonable balance between the burden of compliance and the practicalities of fish landing, SFPA has pursued and achieved approval for landings to Ireland to avail of various derogations.  These allow, in particular for a sample weighing at landing, or a weighing after transport to an Irish premises.  In the case of landings to a Member State for transport to another Member State before weighing, the EU Regulation is prescriptive in only allowing that to occur under the terms of a Common Control Programme agreed between the landing MS and the weighing MS. I am pleased to inform you that due to active engagement by the SFPA with their French counterparts as part of overall pursuit of a level playing field for fisheries control, the EU Commission has approved the Common Control programme between Ireland and France, and anyone landing to Ireland may transport their fish directly to France for weighing, provided they work within the terms of this approved CCP.  The SFPA have engaged in a specific compliance programme including active dialogue with industry stakeholders, with view to discharging Ireland&rsquo;s obligations in this regard.<\/p><p>  At the request of the industry, I have recently added Castletownbere to the list of Irish ports at which third country landings can be processed and this is aimed  to facilitate  an increase in landings of Blue Whiting into Ireland by the Norwegian fleet.

I am aware that sheep prices for the year 2013 to date are disappointing for producers and are running at around 17% below the 2012 level for the corresponding period. This decline is reflected also in other EU member states and can be attributed to a number of factors including increased imports from New Zealand and the impact of austerity in Europe on demand generally. However, I would like to put the current difficulties in context.<\/p><p>  After successive years of decline, 2011\/12 saw an important turning point for the Irish sheep industry.  It was a period when confidence grew on the back of incremental growth in the national breeding flock.  This brought about increased throughput at farm and processing level. During that same period Irish sheep exports delivered double digit growth and retail sales of Irish lamb have grown steadily. These developments are in sharp contrast to other Member States, where sheep meat production and domestic consumption have been falling.  <\/p><p>  Throughout 2012 a higher demand from both the domestic and export markets were evenly matched with supplies, particularly during the peak periods of hogget and main season lamb supply.  Slaughterings in 2012 were up 12%, or 260,000 head to 2.43 million sheep.  This included 68,000 extra hoggets, 160,000 extra lambs and 32,000 additional ewes and rams slaughtered in 2012.   <\/p><p>  On another positive note, exports of Irish sheep meat registered a solid performance in 2012 where total value rose by 7% to &euro;205 million.  Seventy percent of our production was exported, the vast majority of which was destined for the EU market.  Just over 42,000 tonnes were exported to over 24 individual markets across the globe in 2012. France and the UK continue to be our core export markets representing three quarters of our volume exports.  Strong increases in shipments were recorded to Belgium, Germany and Sweden as exporters continue to secure new business and grow volume with existing customers. Despite the ongoing pressure on retail meat sales in Ireland, lamb held its own, with data from Kantar Worldpanel showing a rise of almost 4.5% for the 52 week period ending November 2012.<\/p><p>  Tighter global supplies that characterised the sheepmeat markets in 2011\/12 have eased slightly as global production edges up 1% to 13.6 million.  Good pastures and favourable lambing conditions in Australia and New Zealand have reversed four years of declining output. Production in both countries is forecast to grow by 3-5% this year. Due to the ongoing austerity in Europe and with an increase in the availability of cheaper lamb from the southern hemisphere, in comparison with 12 months ago, the price differential between New Zealand and EU lamb has been widening since summer 2012.  The carryover of UK hoggets into 2013 has also put downward pressure on prices in the early months of 2013. <\/p><p>  Today&rsquo;s consumer seeks value and is prepared to switch to a cheaper protein option.  Lamb is perceived as a relatively expensive meat and Bord Bia promotion campaigns play an important role in positioning lamb as a preferred choice. Increasing the frequency of purchase of Irish lamb and encouraging shoppers to look for the Bord Bia Quality Mark on-pack when shopping will be the key objective of the Bord Bia 2013 lamb promotions. Promotional activities will include radio advertising, which will be undertaken around Easter, announcing the arrival of early season lamb amongst consumers. Similarly, a series of promotional activities to include PR, publicity and in-store activities will be undertaken to coincide with peak availability of new season lamb. The TV advert highlighting the unique flavour of Irish lamb due to our ideal climate will play a central role in our 2013 promotions.<\/p><p>  Overall numbers of lamb producers in the Bord Bia Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme (LQAS) stand at just over 9,300, which roughly equates to 45% of our national throughput.  I recently launched the Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP), which I believe will be a key element in driving the ambitious target for the sheepmeat Sector in Food Harvest 2020. The STAP is intended to provide participants with the knowledge and the skills necessary to improve on-farm technical efficiency in a number of key areas. The sheep sector is a key part of the Agrifood sector, especially in marginal land areas and there is huge scope to improve farm incomes through focusing on issues such as grassland management, financial management, breeding, health and welfare and environmental efficiency. The STAP provides an opportunity to grow the membership base of the LQAS amongst lamb producers, while also promoting the adoption by farmers of best practice in the various aspects of sheep farming. I have allocated &euro;3 million to the STAP for 2013, with a maximum payment of &euro;1,000 per participant. Though the Grassland Sheep Scheme was due to expire at the end of 2012, I decided to extend it for another year and am providing some &euro;14 million for this purpose in 2013. The scheme will be funded from unspent Single Farm Payment funds. I am also providing for a continuation of the sheep fencing scheme in the amount of &euro;3 million this year to enable many farmers in the sheep sector to complete the necessary investment works in order to maintain competitiveness and introduce increased efficiencies on their farm and so secure the future of their enterprises.  I am confident that all of these initiatives will be of significant assistance in developing a strong and sustainable sheep sector for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRBB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":3071,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRBB02350"},{"type":"question","counter":3072,"qnumday":599,"qnumall":"[10240\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRBB02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the total number of farmers in the beef technology scheme in County Galway yet to be paid; if his attention has been drawn to an issue in relation to data inputting which appears to be causing a problem and which is putting farmers under severe pressure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":3073,"content":"<p>Under Food Harvest 2020, ambitious development targets were set for a number of agricultural sectors, including the beef sector.

My Department maintains a permanent presence in approved slaughter plants. Regular visits are made to other Department approved meat plants. The frequency of these inspections in plants other than slaughter plants, which focus primarily on food safety requirements, is determined by a risk assessment, as required under EU legislation, which is conducted for each plant. My Department has been able to reduce the number of inspections at non-slaughter meat plants, where there is no permanent supervisory presence, by moving to a more robust and rigorous targeted system of official controls, based on the risk assessments mentioned above. Official controls and inspections levels are monitored independently by the EU Food and Veterinary Office and by the FSAI under service contract. <\/p><p>  Food business operators in Ireland are responsible inter alia for carrying out checks to ensure that their ingredients come from approved plants. In meat plants that operate under the supervision of the Department, official controls are conducted on these checks to verify their effectiveness. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. Labelling and documentary checks also form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. <\/p><p>  Under the Department&rsquo;s National Residue Programme, and including tests on bovine samples carried out by processors, up to 30,000 samples taken at farm and factory level and covering a wide range of food stuffs are tested annually. These tests relate to microbiological and chemical standards, their primary focus being on food safety. These are fully in accordance with EU testing requirements.  <\/p><p>  In addition the Product Official Sampling and Testing (POST) programme is a microbiological testing programme on samples taken from Department approved ready-to-eat food, meat product, minced meat and meat preparation plants i.e. added value plants. This is part of the official verification of food safety controls in the plants concerned as provided for in Regulations (EC) 852\/2004, 854\/2004 and 2073\/2005. A total of 1,600 samples are taken annually and the sampling and testing is risk based.<\/p><p>  The number of inspections has not been found to be inadequate as compliance with existing food safety and food hygiene requirements was not an issue in relation to the mislabelling of meat products uncovered by the recent FSAI survey. It is clear however that the focus of checks henceforth will also need to include food authenticity and the EU wide programme of DNA testing recently agreed will provide the basis for consideration of future action in this respect.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, in the light of recent developments, officials from my Department and the FSAI met with the meat processing sector on 14th  February to agree a national protocol for DNA testing of meat to be applied at retail, catering and processing level in Ireland.

One of these measures related to the number of weeks over which the free pre-school year could be provided.  At that time, approximately 30% of children in the relevant age-cohort were in full daycare.  Therefore, in order to facilitate full daycare services in the early years of the programme, services were permitted to choose between providing a 38 week or a 50 week model.<\/p><p>  I should emphasise that the ECCE programme is designed as an educational programme for children.  It was always intended, once the programme had bedded-down, to introduce a standard 38 week model.  This is primarily because this is the optimal model in terms of ensuring a high-quality early years experience for pre-school children.  The S&iacute;olta and Aistear frameworks were developed to support this objective. The ECCE programme is designed to be delivered across 38 weeks.  It is difficult to see how the curriculum can be delivered across a 50 week period when the children spend less time (generally 2 hours 15 minutes per day) availing of it.<\/p><p>  My focus is on improving the quality of childcare services.  For this reason, therefore, services participating in the ECCE programme are now required to provide the programme on the basis of 3 hours per day, 5 days per week, over 38 weeks. It is not mandatory that children attend every day but, where they do not, the capitation fee is reduced accordingly.   <\/p><p>  The change to the 38 week model only was introduced in September 2012 and all participating services have successfully made the transition to the new arrangement.

The intern year is an integral part of medical training and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.   Under the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 it is a matter for the HSE to assess, on an annual basis, the number of intern training posts required by the health service.  <\/p><p>  There were 572 intern posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. All 2012 EU graduates from Irish medical schools who sought an intern post here that year and met the HSE eligibility criteria were successful in securing a post. Indeed, to date there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools and a number of additional posts for some non-EU applicants. <\/p><p>  My Department is in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish\/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  It should be noted that under EU law intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying. <\/p><p>  The Higher Education Authority has indicated that the number of medical graduates this year has not yet been finalised. However, the application process for internships commencing in July 2013 closed in November last. A total of 960 eligible applications were received, 652 from EEA applicants and 308 from non-EEA applicants. There is no separate figure available for Irish applicants. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test; meet the HSE English language requirements; provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate; and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams. <\/p><p>  The HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July 2013. In total there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013 and the HSE consider that there will be sufficient capacity and funding to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRCC04100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Primary Care","counter":3161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRCC04150"},{"type":"question","counter":3162,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[9609\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRCC04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the competition issues that have arisen with regard to the introduction of universal primary care; the discussions that have taken place with other Government Departments and agencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3163,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government provides for significant strengthening of primary care services to achieve Universal Primary Care (UPC) with the removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients.

The 426 Teams provide services for almost 4 million of the population with 2,636 HSE staff members and over 1,692 GPs participating.

Part of the debate about the future of our health system overall has been about the most appropriate role for the private sector, and the balance to be drawn between it and the public and voluntary sectors.  The Government is committed to the continued development of a mixed health care system in Ireland, drawing on the strengths of all three sectors.  That said, we are committed to the development of a single-tier health service, in which the distinction between &lsquo;public&rsquo; and &lsquo;private&rsquo; patient is removed.  We can no longer accept a situation where patients can queue-jump because they can afford to pay for faster access.<\/p><p>  Within this context, I believe that the free market has an important role to play, provided that the system is regulated effectively to protect quality and to control costs. For example, private hospitals play an important role in delivering acute services in Ireland, and private companies also deliver community based services, such as home supports for older people.  The move to Universal Health Insurance will involve a very important role for the private sector, in which health insurers will compete for business in a manner designed to drive efficiencies and offer customers choice between funders of health care. While the overall approach to reform will be informed by the experience of other countries and best practice the system as a whole will be uniquely Irish.  Whatever the precise configuration of services as between public, voluntary and private, and whatever the exact role of a regulated free market within the system, my priority is to ensure that all patients and clients receive the best possible service for the lowest cost, in the setting that is most appropriate to their needs.

The FSAI then arranged further intense testing of the samples to validate the correctness of the initial analysis and to quantify the amount of horse DNA in each sample - the results of these tests were received on 11 January 2013. These results showed that, of the 10 burgers found to contain horse DNA, one contained 29% horsemeat, another 0.3% and the remainder had less than 0.1%. Traces of horse DNA were also detected in batches of raw ingredients, including some imported from other Member States.

Furthermore, the Minister for Agriculture, Food &amp; the Marine has initiated and led a rapid and collective response to the horsemeat incident in Europe in his capacity as President of Council of Agriculture Ministers.<\/p><p>  While this is not a food safety issue, officials from my Department are in daily contact with the FSAI in relation to the ongoing horsemeat incident in Europe to ensure there remains no threat to public health.  Since January, extensive sampling and testing of beef products by both regulatory authorities and the food industry has been undertaken. Testing is continuing in Ireland and elsewhere. A major EU wide programme of testing of beef products for the presence of equine DNA is now underway. While many sausage and black and white puddings are pork rather than beef based products, to date no evidence has emerged to suggest they are the subject of adulteration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRDD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Services","counter":3212,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRDD03050"},{"type":"question","counter":3213,"qnumday":648,"qnumall":"[9687\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRDD03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is satisfied with the current waiting times at the accident and emergency department in Kerry General Hospital; if there is an adequate complement of staff currently working in the the A&amp;E; the way current waiting times compare with the previous five years and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3214,"content":"<p>In relation to the query on staffing raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.

The HSE anticipates that all EU graduates from Irish medical schools who meet the eligibility criteria for intern posts and who desire to remain in Ireland for an internship starting in July 2013, will be accommodated within the Irish public health service. The HSE has in place formal agreements with the Intern Training Networks\/Universities regarding the provision of the Medical Council accredited National Intern Training Programme. <\/p><p>  The main reforms of the intern year as recommended by the Report of the National Committee on Medical Education and Training (NCMET) have been implemented by the HSE in collaboration and consultation with the Medical Council and the relevant educational partners at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. The HSE has formal agreements in place with the recognised postgraduate medical training bodies in Ireland regarding the provision of specialist medical education and training to the Non Consultant Hospital Doctor (NCHD) cohort in Ireland.  These agreements set out the number of doctors to be trained by each training body both by year of training and by specialty.  This number is determined by the HSE following consultation with the training bodies and consideration of current and future workforce requirements for qualified specialists.<\/p><p>  The HSE also has formal agreements in place with the recognised postgraduate medical training bodies in Ireland regarding the provision of professional development programmes to NCHDs not engaged in specialist training in Ireland.  The objective of these programmes is to facilitate this cohort of doctors to maintain their professional competence.  In recent years the HSE has invested significantly in the expansion and development of existing and new specialist medical training programmes including the development of a basic specialist training programme in Emergency Medicine; the expansion and reconfiguration of specialist training in Anaesthesia; and an increase in GP training numbers from 120 per year to 157, in line with GP workforce requirements.  <\/p><p>  In addition, the HSE has implemented two scholarship programmes specifically targeting NCHDs in their latter stages of training. The first programme enables NCHDs to undertake specialist training in novel medical areas abroad with a view to returning and developing their new expertise within the Irish health service as specialists. The second programme supports NCHDs in undertaking an integrated PhD research programme with their higher specialist training, thereby further developing high quality relevant clinical research in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRDD03400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Trusts","counter":3218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRDD03450"},{"type":"question","counter":3219,"qnumday":650,"qnumall":"[9695\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRDD03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he considers that criteria such as existing partnerships, existing geographical links and patient access to appropriate services will be key in choosing the appropriate partnerships in his Department's project plan for the establishment of acute hospital groups which would support the co-location of the Rotunda and Mater Hospitals, Dublin, as indicated by KPMG report of 2008; if, at the very least, he will not make a final decision until after the publication of the review of maternity models of care currently being undertaken by the Health Service Executive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3220,"content":"<p>A key stepping stone to the introduction of Universal Health Insurance will be to develop independent not-for-profit hospital trusts in which all hospitals will function as part of an integrated group.

The Department will meet with the FSAI prior to the May meeting to ensure that Irish health policy is reflected during those discussions.  In 2012, my Department requested the FSAI to conduct a national consultation on the display of calories on menus.  Over 95% of respondents expressed their support for this initiative.  I then wrote personally to a range of fast food restaurants requesting that they display calories on menus on a voluntary basis.  Recent monitoring information from the FSAI, found that almost half of the 19 fast food restaurants, coffee shops and catering companies are now displaying calories on menus.  I consider that this will help consumers to make healthier eating choices.  To assist the companies concerned, the FSAI has published technical instructions for Irish food business operators.  It is also in the process of developing a software tool to help Irish companies to count the calories in dishes that are on menus for more than 30 days per year.  The FSAI is currently conducting a large telephone survey and quality assessment evaluating the uptake of calorie menu labelling by Food Service Businesses in Ireland. The final survey results will be ready for publication in March 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WREE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treatment Purchase Fund","counter":3267,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WREE02850"},{"type":"question","counter":3268,"qnumday":673,"qnumall":"[9817\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WREE02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the annual spend from the National Treatment Purchase Fund from 2009 to 2012 for the treatment of bilateral cochlear implants abroad; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3269,"content":"<p>No spending has been incurred by the National Treatment Purchase Fund during the period 2009 to 2012 for such treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WREE03000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":3270,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WREE03050"},{"type":"question","counter":3271,"qnumday":674,"qnumall":"[9831\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WREE03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will review an application for a medical card in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare whose financial circumstances have changed since their original application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3272,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WREE03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3273,"content":"<p>Question No. 675 answered with Question No. 617.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cochlear Implants","counter":3275,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRFF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":3276,"qnumday":676,"qnumall":"[9838\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRFF00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive intends to upgrade and enhance the audiology unit in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; if the HSE intends to make resources available to enable all children who require bilateral cochlear implants to have the essential procedure carried out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1067","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3277,"qnumday":679,"qnumall":"[9855\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRFF00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the outcome of the business plan submission made by Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, for consideration in the 2013 Service Plan for the provision of bilateral cochlear implants; the action being taken and the timeframe involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3278,"qnumday":714,"qnumall":"[10229\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRFF00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 671, 735 and 736 of 19 February 2013, the steps that will be put in place to deal with children who suffer late onset hearing impairment or deafness which may not be picked up in new born screening; the way this group will be affected by any decision that the Health Service Executive and Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, come to in relation to cochlear implants; if he envisages an age cut off point; if guidelines will be put in place to identify which children are suitable for bilateral implants; if he will ensure that those children who suffer from late onset hearing impairment will not be discriminated against.","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3279,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 676, 679 and 714 together.<\/p><p>  The HSE undertook a National Review of Audiology Services.

As well as its long standing links with the Mater, which can and should be retained, it would also be appropriate for the Rotunda to establish links with other hospitals to meet its future aspirations for sub-specialty development and to expand and consolidate the links which currently exist.<\/p><p><br \/>  The KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin, which was completed in 2008, noted that Dublin&#8217;s model of stand alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be co-located with adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new national paediatric hospital. The intention has been that the National Maternity Hospital should be relocated to St Vincent's, the Coombe to Tallaght and the Rotunda to the Mater, and the maternity hospitals have been working with the relevant adult sites to progress this. There will be early discussions with the maternity hospitals regarding their maternity \/adult co-location plans in the context of the Government decision to build the new children&#8217;s hospital on the St James&#8217;s campus.  Notwithstanding this, I am committed to the intent of the report - that the Dublin maternity hospitals be located alongside adult acute services - while also bearing in mind the  need to plan for the provision of tri-located paediatric , adult and maternity services, as is the intention in relation to the new children's hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRHH00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services","counter":3401,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRHH00525"},{"type":"question","counter":3402,"qnumday":722,"qnumall":"[10256\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRHH00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons awaiting orthodontic treatment in County Kerry; the length of time they are waiting; the progress that has been made to reduce the waiting lists in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3403,"content":"<p>The HSE provides orthodontic treatment to patients based on their level of clinical need.

where the income guidelines are exceeded.The HSE set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.  There is an emergency process for a person who is terminally ill, or in urgent need of medical attention and cannot afford to pay for it, that provides a card within 24 hours while the normal application process is completed.Once a letter from the patient's GP or consultant is received stating that the person is terminally ill and the required personal details are provided, an emergency card is issued to that person for a six-month period.  The Programme for Government commits to reforming the current public health system by introducing Universal Health Insurance with equal access to care for all.

To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0with effect\u00a0from 1st   April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.\u00a0<\/p><p>  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee\u00a0in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport. There is significant\u00a0 scope for\u00a0achieving greater levels of transport integration and coordinated delivery across a range of Exchequer funded local and rural transport services such as school and HSE transport services.<\/p><p>  I am very aware of the very valuable work done on the ground by the RTP Groups such as Westmeath Rural Transport in ensuring that the transport needs of their local community are being identified and delivered within available resources. However, given\u00a0 resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the establishment of better alignment between the 35 RTP groups and local authorities, it is\u00a0necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised. <\/p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. \u00a0One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Coordination Units be established.\u00a0 Discussions are taking place with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the County and City Managers Association and the Rural Transport Network in the context of aligning the new structure with the local authority structure. \u00a0I would emphasise that no decision has been taken but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.<\/p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the rural transport programme will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector. \u00a0Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.   While I can understand and fully appreciate that this creates a level of uncertainty for RTP groups, I am hopeful that the outcome will be a better service delivered more efficiently. I will work with all involved over the coming months to make any transition as smooth as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRJJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driving Licences","counter":3463,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRJJ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":3464,"qnumday":747,"qnumall":"[9631\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600069#WRJJ01100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will report on the process of establishing a new system of photo capture for driving licences which has been awarded solely to the National Driver Licence Service; if there was a competitive tendering process for his new system; his views regarding the impact of the ending of photo ID services in local business including local pharmacies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":3465,"content":"<p>Following a Government decision, the driver licensing service has been centralised under the Road Safety Authority (RSA).

This was a historic meeting as it marked the first under new universal membership arrangements for UNEP agreed in &quot;The Future We Want&quot; document at the Rio +20 Conference held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in June 2012. Environment nisters attending the Session backed decisions designed to ensure a strengthened and upgraded institution that will be able to meet the environmental challenges of the 21st century. This  was the first major restructuring of UNEP since it was founded four decades ago. The negotiations in Nairobi were challenging, particularly in relation to the new institutional arrangements and it fell to the Irish Presidency to coordinate the EU&#8217;s input to these negotiations. <\/p><p>The Irish Presidency team&#8217;s co-ordination role involved managing multiple parallel tracks of meetings and participating in a number of bi-lateral meetings with other non-EU delegations during the Session.  Following agreement on all the major decisions tabled, the Irish Presidency on behalf of the EU and its Member States welcomed the outcome of the Session. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Ministerial segment took place over the first three days of the Session during which I and fellow nisters discussed a range of issues including the key priority of Institutional Reform of UNEP, Sustainable Development Goals, and the Green Economy . In addition, the Governing Council took a number of other decisions across a range of themes including on sustainable consumption and production, green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, chemicals and waste and UNEP&#8217;s Programme of Work and Budget. Further details on the negotiations and outcomes of the meeting are available at <i><i>.<\/i><\/i><i><\/i>On the eve of the Governing Council I addressed a High Level international meeting on the Rule of Law and the Environment which brought together nisters of the Environment and Government representatives with representatives of the judicial, legal and auditing professions.   <\/p><p><br \/>  I attended and spoke at round table discussions on emerging policy issues in the area of the environment and also attended lunchtime discussions, hosted by the Executive Director of UNEP, Mr. Achim Steiner, on the Green Economy. I also outlined, in my Presidency role, key EU priorities and concerns on the institutional arrangements for UNEP being discussed at the Session. In addition, I attended and spoke on behalf of the EU at a Ministerial Breakfast hosted by the German nistry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, for key players in the negotiations. I also attended a reception hosted by the Head of the EU delegation in Nairobi at which Sustainable Development Goals were discussed.   <\/p><p><br \/>  While at the Governing Council I also took the opportunity to have a number of bilateral meetings. I met with the Executive Director of UNEP to discuss a number of issues including the key issues before the Session, Ireland&#8217;s Presidency of the EU in the context of the Informal Environment Council which takes place in Dublin on 22\/23 April next and issues relating to the GEMS Water Programme, which is the primary source for global water quality data and information. I had further discussions on this latter issue with UNEP at official level. <\/p><p><br \/>  I also met with Mr. Richard Beynon, the UK Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Natural Environment, Water and Rural Affairs, during which we discussed priorities for Ireland&#8217;s Presidency of the EU.

In determining an application for the opening of an insolvency proceeding, for which it would have exclusive power as the primary proceedings, of a company or of a natural person, the Regulation requires that a court should determine the centre of main interest (COMI) of the applicant in the context of  assuming jurisdiction.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is a matter for the court to satisfy itself that the provisions in its national law in this regard have been observed.  For example, the UK Courts can and have refused or revoked insolvency proceedings where an abuse has been detected. Indeed, this has occurred with certain individuals, who were subsequently subject to insolvency proceedings in this jurisdiction. <\/p><p><br \/>  A company or natural person is entitled to change a COMI and could do so for the purposes, <i>inter-alia<\/i>   of taking advantage of more favourable insolvency legislation. This entitlement arises under the broad rubric of freedom of movement in the Internal Market and such freedom has been enforced by decisions of the European Court of Justice. The country in which the debts are incurred is not necessarily material, but the relocation must not be artificial. The question of COMI is determined at the date the application for the insolvency proceeding is made and not at the time the debts were incurred. Orders made in insolvency proceedings in another EU jurisdiction, including an order discharging a person from bankruptcy, are enforceable against creditors elsewhere in the EU. <\/p><p><br \/>  In response to the economic downturn across Europe, the EU has published a proposal to modernise cross-border insolvency law which seeks to make cross-border insolvency proceedings more efficient, benefiting both debtors and creditors throughout the EU.  One of the primary aims of the new Regulation will be to give potentially viable companies and entrepreneurs a second chance before being declared insolvent. The proposal also addresses a range of other insolvency issues. <\/p><p><br \/>  I arranged that the initial discussion on the proposed Regulation took place at the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting of EU Justice Ministers held in Dublin Castle on the 17 and 18 of January last. The Ministers, including my British colleague, engaged in a very detailed and constructive discussion on the proposals contained in the Regulation. I emphasised the importance of a more uniform approach across the EU in regard to the establishment of the centre of main interest so as to combat potential abuses in this regard which have given rise to allegations of &quot;bankruptcy tourism&quot;. <\/p><p><br \/>  Detailed consideration of the provisions contained in the new draft Regulation has now  commenced in a Working Group chaired by the Irish Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600072#WRV02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tribunals of Inquiry","counter":3654,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600072#WRV02050"},{"type":"question","counter":3655,"qnumday":488,"qnumall":"[9768\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600072#WRV02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 153 of 12 December 2012, the progress made on the recommendations of the Moriarty Tribunal;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3656,"content":"<p>As stated in my reply on 12 December 2012, insofar as the report of the Moriarty Tribunal made recommendations concerning the future operation of tribunals of inquiry, many of these recommendations are anticipated by the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005 which awaits Report Stage debate in the D&aacute;il.

The Board prioritises certain categories of cases and these cases will receive an immediate or near immediate service.  The main categories of case types that are prioritised are public law child care cases, child abduction cases and domestic violence cases.  In addition, the Board has been piloting a triage approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in a number of law centres.  The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times.  The aim of the triage approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes).  If the applicant requires further services they remain on the waiting list.  There is or has been a backlog of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Board is taking other steps in an effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery including introducing a new case management system in its law centres, integrating its mediation and legal services, integrating its Refugee Legal Service into the general law centre service delivery model and maintaining a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court.  The reality is that the Board must live within its budget and is subject to the public service recruitment moratorium (there is a very limited derogation).  Demand for the Board's services has increased significantly since the downturn in the economy.  There was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011.  However, demand in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006.  The capacity to provide a meaningful service is a priority for the Board.  In 2013, the Board will examine other options in an effort to enable legal services to be provided promptly to those most in need of them.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to Criminal Legal Aid, total expenditure for 2012 came to &#8364;50.5 million, a reduction of 10% over the 2011 figure of &#8364;56.1 million.  This reduction in the annual expenditure is the largest ever recorded and represents a fall of approximately &#8364;10 million, or 16%, over the peak recorded in 2009.  As the Scheme is demand led it is difficult to predict and control expenditure because it depends on the number of criminal cases coming before the courts.  The Task Force on Cost Reductions on Criminal Legal Aid identified a range of measures which could potentially contribute to costs reductions in this area.  As I stated in the Topical Issues debate referred to in the Deputy's question, a requirement on applicants to make an initial payment could give rise to constitutional difficulties and difficulties arising from the European Convention on Human Rights.  It would not be feasible to introduce arrangements which give rise to further administrative expense and demands on resources for no real benefit.  A new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is planned to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, <i>inter alia<\/i>, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions must have regard to a person's rights to the presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to be given legal aid, where appropriate.  I hope it will be possible to publish the Bill during the course of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600073#WRW01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service","counter":3677,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600073#WRW01450"},{"type":"question","counter":3678,"qnumday":495,"qnumall":"[9910\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600073#WRW01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the total amount spent on outsourced security services in the Court Services for 2012; and if he will provide details of the companies providing these services.","asker":"1032","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":3679,"qnumday":496,"qnumall":"[9911\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600073#WRW01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the total amount spent on outsourced cleaning services in the Court Services for 2012; and if he will provide details of the companies providing these services.; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1032","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3680,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 495 and 496 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions, including the provision and maintenance of accommodation for court sittings.

All States operate immigration controls for well established reasons of public policy, including considerations of an economic nature which in the case of Ireland remains extremely challenging with ongoing high levels of unemployment. There are also considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account.<\/p><p>  Legal and illegal migration are two sides of the same coin and a balanced policy needs to facilitate regular migration channels while at the same time take action against immigration abuse.  Many people from overseas have made Ireland their home in recent years.  In this context it is worth noting that many of the EU citizens who arrived here during times of economic prosperity have chosen to remain notwithstanding the change in economic circumstances.  In addition, many individuals have been granted citizenship in recent years.  Over the past two years alone, approximately 38,000 individuals have successfully applied for and been successful in their citizenship applications, approximately 13,000 in 2011 and approximately 25,000 in 2012. <\/p><p>  Of course, citizenship is not the only means of attaining lawful residence in the State.  For example, through an accrual of employment permits an individual may choose to apply for long term residence, or to continue to renew his or her status on an annual basis. Tens of thousands of immigrants have remained on in the State on foot of such provisions.<\/p><p>  Clearly, all illegal immigrant cases are not the same and must be dealt with on a case by case basis and on the basis of their individual circumstances.  At one end of the scale are those where the person's illegal status is through no fault of their own and indeed my Department has been dealing with cases of this nature on an ongoing basis.  However there are also much more egregious instances of immigration abuse, often at considerable expense to the State and it does not follow that such persons should profit from their conduct. <\/p><p>  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.<\/p><p>  In looking at cases as they arise, among the issues that would be relevant to the outcome would be the circumstances in which the person became undocumented, the length of time they have been in that situation, their prospects of being able to gain lawful employment without being a drain on the financial resources of the State along with the more general considerations applicable to immigration decisions, including any family related rights they may have in the context of the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p><p>  Sometimes case by case consideration will result in a positive outcome for the applicant.  However, in other cases this may result in a decision by the Irish authorities, subject to the oversight of our Courts, that the person has to go home.  That decision should be respected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRX01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Offences","counter":3711,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRX01450"},{"type":"question","counter":3712,"qnumday":507,"qnumall":"[10043\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRX01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of holders of category W driving licences that have been convicted for towing a trailer on a work vehicle or land tractor in each of the years 2010, 2011 and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3713,"content":"<p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.

It is a matter for the court to satisfy itself that the provisions in its national law in this regard have been observed. For example, the UK Courts can and have refused or revoked insolvency proceedings where an abuse has been detected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRX02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Aid Service Expenditure","counter":3732,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRX02850"},{"type":"question","counter":3733,"qnumday":514,"qnumall":"[10124\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRX02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the amount of funding that was given to Free Legal Aid for the periods 2010, 2011 and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3734,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that my Department made available the sum of &euro;98,000 to the Free Legal Advice Centres (FLAC) in each of the years 2010, 2011 and 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRX03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sentencing Policy","counter":3735,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRX03050"},{"type":"question","counter":3736,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[10132\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRX03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans for establishing sentencing guidelines; if he intends to set up a sentencing council; the discussions he has held with the LRC on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3737,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that judges are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  In accordance with this principle, the role of the Oireachtas has been to specify in law a maximum penalty and a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.<\/p><p>  There are, of course, a small number of situations where statute has created exceptions to this approach most notably by providing for mandatory sentences for murder and presumptive minimum sentences in the case of certain firearms and drug trafficking offences.  Except for exceptional circumstances, I am of the view that the Oireachtas should be cautious in prescribing mandatory sentences.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient. The Law Reform Commission is currently examining the law in relation to mandatory sentences and I understand that this work will be completed this year.<\/p><p>  It would not be in keeping with the principles of judicial independence for the Executive to impose a Sentencing Council on the Judiciary. For similar reasons, the Deputy may be aware that the Law Reform Commission, after detailed study some years ago, recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines but favoured non-statutory sentencing principles.  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  Information on over 1,000 cases is detailed on the website and I welcome the committee's recent announcement that two JobBridge interns are to be appointed shortly in order to recommence populating the online database with information on sentencing in the criminal courts. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that the ISIS committee announced they are planning to recommence providing information on sentencing in relation to specific issues in which context an analysis has been published on rape sentencing prepared by the Judicial Researchers Office under the guidance of Mr. Justice Peter Charleton.  I understand that seminars are also planned, including one focusing on the work of the Sentencing Council in the UK.<\/p><p>Finally, in September 2012, I announced a strategic review of penal policy. I have established a working group to carry out this review which will examine all aspects of penal policy and I expect the Group to report later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRX03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport","counter":3738,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRX03250"},{"type":"question","counter":3739,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[10139\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRX03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 129 of 7 February 2013, of the 31 patrol vehicles allocated to the Tipperary Division if he will provide a breakdown by district of the number of these cars that are operated by the Traffic Corps within their division; the number that are used solely for patrol purposes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3740,"content":"<p>Decisions in relation to the provision and deployment of Garda transport are matters for the Garda Commissioner.

These proposals also draw heavily from the regulatory and practise models of England and Wales which do not always correspond to those of our jurisdiction nor to those set out under current Government policy in the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011.  Under Section 30 of the Bill, provision is already made for public consultation in relation to the creation of a new profession of conveyancer.

It is one of 6 Fishery Harbour Centres operated by the State, each of whose primary purpose is to provide facilities and services for the fishing industry and fisheries-related activities.  <\/p><p>  There has been significant capital investment in the Fishery Harbour Centres in recent years, underpinning both the fisheries side and, in parallel, their expanding use for leisure and marine tourism and other maritime enterprises.  Howth in particular has a long tradition in both areas.  All of the users of the Fishery Harbour need to be accommodated in a safe and secure facility, and the Department has a duty of care towards anyone entering it.  Apart from any other considerations, the upkeep of the Harbour so that it meets with current health and safety standards has a cost and this cost must be paid for out of the income generated. <\/p><p>  In the current economic climate, the State must be fully committed to maximising the return on its investment.  Furthermore, my Department is required to ensure that the Fishery Harbour Centres are run on a financially sound basis.  <\/p><p>  With over 500 parking spaces within the boundaries of the Fishery Harbour Centre at present, it is clear that a significant source of revenue exists that could assist in balancing the books, and providing funding for enhancements that would not otherwise be possible.<\/p><p>  I am reviewing all aspects of the matter at present.  I can assure the Deputy that the views of the various harbour users, the potential earnings, the possible impact on the harbour businesses and recreational users, the impact on the local economy, the impact on overall traffic management within the Fishery Harbour, are all matters that I will take into account in coming to a decision. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRZ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Afforestation Programme","counter":3851,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRZ02950"},{"type":"question","counter":3852,"qnumday":559,"qnumall":"[9640\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRZ03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding an afforestation application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":3853,"content":"<p>The application for pre-planting approval submitted by the person named is located within a Special Protection Area (SPA) designated for the protection of the hen harrier.

Up to that point there was no basis for any action.  My Department was requested on 21st   December by the FSAI to obtain samples of raw ingredients in the context of the FSAI survey on the authenticity of meat products, preliminary results of which indicated traces of non-bovine DNA.

I would point out, however, that the Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to enact legislation to regulate certain practices in the grocery goods sector.  The Government intends to give effect to this commitment by including an enabling provision in the legislation currently being prepared to merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, which will allow for the introduction of a statutory Code of Practice.  Work on drafting the Consumer and Competition Bill is on-going and the Bill is included in the &ldquo;A list&rdquo; in the Government&rsquo;s current Legislative Programme.  It is important to point out that in introducing a statutory Code the intention is not to protect one stakeholder over another nor is the Code intended to prevent stakeholders such as retailers and suppliers from engaging in the type of contractual negotiations that happen in most other sectors of the economy.  It is also the case that the Code is not seeking in any way to determine the price of grocery goods. Rather, the essential value of the Code is that by regulating problematic practices in the grocery goods sector it seeks to strike a fair balance between the competing interests of the various stakeholders including the interests of the end user, the consumer.<\/p><p>  The Government is strongly of the view that it important to ensure there is balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector and that Ireland continues to have strong agri food and retail sectors, particularly given the importance of these sectors to the national economy.  The introduction of a Code of Practice, as provided for in the Programme for Government, is intended to achieve such a balance taking into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector.  It must also be noted, however, that arrangements in the domestic market are not the primary influence on farmers&rsquo; incomes.  Unsurprisingly, with an Agri-Food industry that exported over &euro;9bn of goods last year, the bulk of most Irish farmers&rsquo; produce is exported (e.g. 4 out of 5 beef cattle produced in Ireland are consumed in other countries), so EU and world prices have a much bigger influence on the price farmers receive for their output overall than does the retail price in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRAA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":3891,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRAA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":3892,"qnumday":572,"qnumall":"[9710\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRAA01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when the agri environment options scheme 1 payment will be made available to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":3893,"content":"<p>The person named was approved for participation in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme with effect from the 1st September 2010 and full payments totalling &euro;608.11 and &euro;4,195.14 issued in respect of 2010 and 2011 respectively.

An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is working to address this issue, particularly as oil prices increase and the cost of sending trawlers full of fish to Spain, France, Scotland and Norway becomes less economical.  With the increase in the Blue whiting quota for 2013, it is anticipated that there will be increased levels of this stock landed into Ireland by foreign vessels.  I understand that negotiations are ongoing between representatives of the French fishing industry and Irish processing interests, with a view to increasing French landings into Ireland.  A pilot initiative was developed between BIM, Irish processors and French industry during late 2012.  All concerned are seeking to build on the success of this initiative in 2013.<\/p><p>  In relation to official controls carried out by the SFPA these are done in order to discharge Ireland's obligations under the Framework for the control of the Common Fisheries Policy in EU Waters  as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1224\/2009, establishing a Community control system to ensure compliance with the rules of the CFP and Council Regulation (EC) No 1005\/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.  Detailed rules for the implementation of the control regulation are set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404\/2011, and I have implemented these in national law through Statutory Instrument 320 of 2012 as amended.  This is the regulatory EU framework against which the SFPA carries out its inspection regime.<\/p><p>  These regulations contain an explicit default obligation requiring that all fish be weighed by operators at the point of landing.  In order to ensure a reasonable balance between the burden of compliance and the practicalities of fish landing, SFPA has pursued and achieved approval for landings to Ireland to avail of various derogations.  These allow, in particular for a sample weighing at landing, or a weighing after transport to an Irish premises.  In the case of landings to a Member State for transport to another Member State before weighing, the EU Regulation is prescriptive in only allowing that to occur under the terms of a Common Control Programme agreed between the landing MS and the weighing MS. I am pleased to inform you that due to active engagement by the SFPA with their French counterparts as part of overall pursuit of a level playing field for fisheries control, the EU Commission has approved the Common Control programme between Ireland and France, and anyone landing to Ireland may transport their fish directly to France for weighing, provided they work within the terms of this approved CCP.  The SFPA have engaged in a specific compliance programme including active dialogue with industry stakeholders, with view to discharging Ireland&rsquo;s obligations in this regard.<\/p><p>  At the request of the industry, I have recently added Castletownbere to the list of Irish ports at which third country landings can be processed and this is aimed  to facilitate  an increase in landings of Blue Whiting into Ireland by the Norwegian fleet.

I am aware that sheep prices for the year 2013 to date are disappointing for producers and are running at around 17% below the 2012 level for the corresponding period. This decline is reflected also in other EU member states and can be attributed to a number of factors including increased imports from New Zealand and the impact of austerity in Europe on demand generally. However, I would like to put the current difficulties in context.<\/p><p>  After successive years of decline, 2011\/12 saw an important turning point for the Irish sheep industry.  It was a period when confidence grew on the back of incremental growth in the national breeding flock.  This brought about increased throughput at farm and processing level. During that same period Irish sheep exports delivered double digit growth and retail sales of Irish lamb have grown steadily. These developments are in sharp contrast to other Member States, where sheep meat production and domestic consumption have been falling.  <\/p><p>  Throughout 2012 a higher demand from both the domestic and export markets were evenly matched with supplies, particularly during the peak periods of hogget and main season lamb supply.  Slaughterings in 2012 were up 12%, or 260,000 head to 2.43 million sheep.  This included 68,000 extra hoggets, 160,000 extra lambs and 32,000 additional ewes and rams slaughtered in 2012.   <\/p><p>  On another positive note, exports of Irish sheep meat registered a solid performance in 2012 where total value rose by 7% to &euro;205 million.  Seventy percent of our production was exported, the vast majority of which was destined for the EU market.  Just over 42,000 tonnes were exported to over 24 individual markets across the globe in 2012. France and the UK continue to be our core export markets representing three quarters of our volume exports.  Strong increases in shipments were recorded to Belgium, Germany and Sweden as exporters continue to secure new business and grow volume with existing customers. Despite the ongoing pressure on retail meat sales in Ireland, lamb held its own, with data from Kantar Worldpanel showing a rise of almost 4.5% for the 52 week period ending November 2012.<\/p><p>  Tighter global supplies that characterised the sheepmeat markets in 2011\/12 have eased slightly as global production edges up 1% to 13.6 million.  Good pastures and favourable lambing conditions in Australia and New Zealand have reversed four years of declining output. Production in both countries is forecast to grow by 3-5% this year. Due to the ongoing austerity in Europe and with an increase in the availability of cheaper lamb from the southern hemisphere, in comparison with 12 months ago, the price differential between New Zealand and EU lamb has been widening since summer 2012.  The carryover of UK hoggets into 2013 has also put downward pressure on prices in the early months of 2013. <\/p><p>  Today&rsquo;s consumer seeks value and is prepared to switch to a cheaper protein option.  Lamb is perceived as a relatively expensive meat and Bord Bia promotion campaigns play an important role in positioning lamb as a preferred choice. Increasing the frequency of purchase of Irish lamb and encouraging shoppers to look for the Bord Bia Quality Mark on-pack when shopping will be the key objective of the Bord Bia 2013 lamb promotions. Promotional activities will include radio advertising, which will be undertaken around Easter, announcing the arrival of early season lamb amongst consumers. Similarly, a series of promotional activities to include PR, publicity and in-store activities will be undertaken to coincide with peak availability of new season lamb. The TV advert highlighting the unique flavour of Irish lamb due to our ideal climate will play a central role in our 2013 promotions.<\/p><p>  Overall numbers of lamb producers in the Bord Bia Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme (LQAS) stand at just over 9,300, which roughly equates to 45% of our national throughput.  I recently launched the Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP), which I believe will be a key element in driving the ambitious target for the sheepmeat Sector in Food Harvest 2020. The STAP is intended to provide participants with the knowledge and the skills necessary to improve on-farm technical efficiency in a number of key areas. The sheep sector is a key part of the Agrifood sector, especially in marginal land areas and there is huge scope to improve farm incomes through focusing on issues such as grassland management, financial management, breeding, health and welfare and environmental efficiency. The STAP provides an opportunity to grow the membership base of the LQAS amongst lamb producers, while also promoting the adoption by farmers of best practice in the various aspects of sheep farming. I have allocated &euro;3 million to the STAP for 2013, with a maximum payment of &euro;1,000 per participant. Though the Grassland Sheep Scheme was due to expire at the end of 2012, I decided to extend it for another year and am providing some &euro;14 million for this purpose in 2013. The scheme will be funded from unspent Single Farm Payment funds. I am also providing for a continuation of the sheep fencing scheme in the amount of &euro;3 million this year to enable many farmers in the sheep sector to complete the necessary investment works in order to maintain competitiveness and introduce increased efficiencies on their farm and so secure the future of their enterprises.  I am confident that all of these initiatives will be of significant assistance in developing a strong and sustainable sheep sector for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRBB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":3971,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRBB02350"},{"type":"question","counter":3972,"qnumday":599,"qnumall":"[10240\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRBB02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the total number of farmers in the beef technology scheme in County Galway yet to be paid; if his attention has been drawn to an issue in relation to data inputting which appears to be causing a problem and which is putting farmers under severe pressure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":3973,"content":"<p>Under Food Harvest 2020, ambitious development targets were set for a number of agricultural sectors, including the beef sector.

My Department maintains a permanent presence in approved slaughter plants. Regular visits are made to other Department approved meat plants. The frequency of these inspections in plants other than slaughter plants, which focus primarily on food safety requirements, is determined by a risk assessment, as required under EU legislation, which is conducted for each plant. My Department has been able to reduce the number of inspections at non-slaughter meat plants, where there is no permanent supervisory presence, by moving to a more robust and rigorous targeted system of official controls, based on the risk assessments mentioned above. Official controls and inspections levels are monitored independently by the EU Food and Veterinary Office and by the FSAI under service contract. <\/p><p>  Food business operators in Ireland are responsible inter alia for carrying out checks to ensure that their ingredients come from approved plants. In meat plants that operate under the supervision of the Department, official controls are conducted on these checks to verify their effectiveness. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. Labelling and documentary checks also form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. <\/p><p>  Under the Department&rsquo;s National Residue Programme, and including tests on bovine samples carried out by processors, up to 30,000 samples taken at farm and factory level and covering a wide range of food stuffs are tested annually. These tests relate to microbiological and chemical standards, their primary focus being on food safety. These are fully in accordance with EU testing requirements.  <\/p><p>  In addition the Product Official Sampling and Testing (POST) programme is a microbiological testing programme on samples taken from Department approved ready-to-eat food, meat product, minced meat and meat preparation plants i.e. added value plants. This is part of the official verification of food safety controls in the plants concerned as provided for in Regulations (EC) 852\/2004, 854\/2004 and 2073\/2005. A total of 1,600 samples are taken annually and the sampling and testing is risk based.<\/p><p>  The number of inspections has not been found to be inadequate as compliance with existing food safety and food hygiene requirements was not an issue in relation to the mislabelling of meat products uncovered by the recent FSAI survey. It is clear however that the focus of checks henceforth will also need to include food authenticity and the EU wide programme of DNA testing recently agreed will provide the basis for consideration of future action in this respect.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, in the light of recent developments, officials from my Department and the FSAI met with the meat processing sector on 14th  February to agree a national protocol for DNA testing of meat to be applied at retail, catering and processing level in Ireland.

One of these measures related to the number of weeks over which the free pre-school year could be provided.  At that time, approximately 30% of children in the relevant age-cohort were in full daycare.  Therefore, in order to facilitate full daycare services in the early years of the programme, services were permitted to choose between providing a 38 week or a 50 week model.<\/p><p>  I should emphasise that the ECCE programme is designed as an educational programme for children.  It was always intended, once the programme had bedded-down, to introduce a standard 38 week model.  This is primarily because this is the optimal model in terms of ensuring a high-quality early years experience for pre-school children.  The S&iacute;olta and Aistear frameworks were developed to support this objective. The ECCE programme is designed to be delivered across 38 weeks.  It is difficult to see how the curriculum can be delivered across a 50 week period when the children spend less time (generally 2 hours 15 minutes per day) availing of it.<\/p><p>  My focus is on improving the quality of childcare services.  For this reason, therefore, services participating in the ECCE programme are now required to provide the programme on the basis of 3 hours per day, 5 days per week, over 38 weeks. It is not mandatory that children attend every day but, where they do not, the capitation fee is reduced accordingly.   <\/p><p>  The change to the 38 week model only was introduced in September 2012 and all participating services have successfully made the transition to the new arrangement.

The intern year is an integral part of medical training and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.   Under the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 it is a matter for the HSE to assess, on an annual basis, the number of intern training posts required by the health service.  <\/p><p>  There were 572 intern posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. All 2012 EU graduates from Irish medical schools who sought an intern post here that year and met the HSE eligibility criteria were successful in securing a post. Indeed, to date there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools and a number of additional posts for some non-EU applicants. <\/p><p>  My Department is in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish\/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  It should be noted that under EU law intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying. <\/p><p>  The Higher Education Authority has indicated that the number of medical graduates this year has not yet been finalised. However, the application process for internships commencing in July 2013 closed in November last. A total of 960 eligible applications were received, 652 from EEA applicants and 308 from non-EEA applicants. There is no separate figure available for Irish applicants. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test; meet the HSE English language requirements; provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate; and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams. <\/p><p>  The HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July 2013. In total there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013 and the HSE consider that there will be sufficient capacity and funding to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRCC04100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Primary Care","counter":4061,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRCC04150"},{"type":"question","counter":4062,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[9609\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRCC04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the competition issues that have arisen with regard to the introduction of universal primary care; the discussions that have taken place with other Government Departments and agencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4063,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government provides for significant strengthening of primary care services to achieve Universal Primary Care (UPC) with the removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients.

The 426 Teams provide services for almost 4 million of the population with 2,636 HSE staff members and over 1,692 GPs participating.

Part of the debate about the future of our health system overall has been about the most appropriate role for the private sector, and the balance to be drawn between it and the public and voluntary sectors.  The Government is committed to the continued development of a mixed health care system in Ireland, drawing on the strengths of all three sectors.  That said, we are committed to the development of a single-tier health service, in which the distinction between &lsquo;public&rsquo; and &lsquo;private&rsquo; patient is removed.  We can no longer accept a situation where patients can queue-jump because they can afford to pay for faster access.<\/p><p>  Within this context, I believe that the free market has an important role to play, provided that the system is regulated effectively to protect quality and to control costs. For example, private hospitals play an important role in delivering acute services in Ireland, and private companies also deliver community based services, such as home supports for older people.  The move to Universal Health Insurance will involve a very important role for the private sector, in which health insurers will compete for business in a manner designed to drive efficiencies and offer customers choice between funders of health care. While the overall approach to reform will be informed by the experience of other countries and best practice the system as a whole will be uniquely Irish.  Whatever the precise configuration of services as between public, voluntary and private, and whatever the exact role of a regulated free market within the system, my priority is to ensure that all patients and clients receive the best possible service for the lowest cost, in the setting that is most appropriate to their needs.

The FSAI then arranged further intense testing of the samples to validate the correctness of the initial analysis and to quantify the amount of horse DNA in each sample - the results of these tests were received on 11 January 2013. These results showed that, of the 10 burgers found to contain horse DNA, one contained 29% horsemeat, another 0.3% and the remainder had less than 0.1%. Traces of horse DNA were also detected in batches of raw ingredients, including some imported from other Member States.

Furthermore, the Minister for Agriculture, Food &amp; the Marine has initiated and led a rapid and collective response to the horsemeat incident in Europe in his capacity as President of Council of Agriculture Ministers.<\/p><p>  While this is not a food safety issue, officials from my Department are in daily contact with the FSAI in relation to the ongoing horsemeat incident in Europe to ensure there remains no threat to public health.  Since January, extensive sampling and testing of beef products by both regulatory authorities and the food industry has been undertaken. Testing is continuing in Ireland and elsewhere. A major EU wide programme of testing of beef products for the presence of equine DNA is now underway. While many sausage and black and white puddings are pork rather than beef based products, to date no evidence has emerged to suggest they are the subject of adulteration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRDD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Services","counter":4112,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRDD03050"},{"type":"question","counter":4113,"qnumday":648,"qnumall":"[9687\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRDD03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is satisfied with the current waiting times at the accident and emergency department in Kerry General Hospital; if there is an adequate complement of staff currently working in the the A&amp;E; the way current waiting times compare with the previous five years and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4114,"content":"<p>In relation to the query on staffing raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.

The HSE anticipates that all EU graduates from Irish medical schools who meet the eligibility criteria for intern posts and who desire to remain in Ireland for an internship starting in July 2013, will be accommodated within the Irish public health service. The HSE has in place formal agreements with the Intern Training Networks\/Universities regarding the provision of the Medical Council accredited National Intern Training Programme. <\/p><p>  The main reforms of the intern year as recommended by the Report of the National Committee on Medical Education and Training (NCMET) have been implemented by the HSE in collaboration and consultation with the Medical Council and the relevant educational partners at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. The HSE has formal agreements in place with the recognised postgraduate medical training bodies in Ireland regarding the provision of specialist medical education and training to the Non Consultant Hospital Doctor (NCHD) cohort in Ireland.  These agreements set out the number of doctors to be trained by each training body both by year of training and by specialty.  This number is determined by the HSE following consultation with the training bodies and consideration of current and future workforce requirements for qualified specialists.<\/p><p>  The HSE also has formal agreements in place with the recognised postgraduate medical training bodies in Ireland regarding the provision of professional development programmes to NCHDs not engaged in specialist training in Ireland.  The objective of these programmes is to facilitate this cohort of doctors to maintain their professional competence.  In recent years the HSE has invested significantly in the expansion and development of existing and new specialist medical training programmes including the development of a basic specialist training programme in Emergency Medicine; the expansion and reconfiguration of specialist training in Anaesthesia; and an increase in GP training numbers from 120 per year to 157, in line with GP workforce requirements.  <\/p><p>  In addition, the HSE has implemented two scholarship programmes specifically targeting NCHDs in their latter stages of training. The first programme enables NCHDs to undertake specialist training in novel medical areas abroad with a view to returning and developing their new expertise within the Irish health service as specialists. The second programme supports NCHDs in undertaking an integrated PhD research programme with their higher specialist training, thereby further developing high quality relevant clinical research in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRDD03400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Trusts","counter":4118,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRDD03450"},{"type":"question","counter":4119,"qnumday":650,"qnumall":"[9695\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRDD03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he considers that criteria such as existing partnerships, existing geographical links and patient access to appropriate services will be key in choosing the appropriate partnerships in his Department's project plan for the establishment of acute hospital groups which would support the co-location of the Rotunda and Mater Hospitals, Dublin, as indicated by KPMG report of 2008; if, at the very least, he will not make a final decision until after the publication of the review of maternity models of care currently being undertaken by the Health Service Executive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4120,"content":"<p>A key stepping stone to the introduction of Universal Health Insurance will be to develop independent not-for-profit hospital trusts in which all hospitals will function as part of an integrated group.

The Department will meet with the FSAI prior to the May meeting to ensure that Irish health policy is reflected during those discussions.  In 2012, my Department requested the FSAI to conduct a national consultation on the display of calories on menus.  Over 95% of respondents expressed their support for this initiative.  I then wrote personally to a range of fast food restaurants requesting that they display calories on menus on a voluntary basis.  Recent monitoring information from the FSAI, found that almost half of the 19 fast food restaurants, coffee shops and catering companies are now displaying calories on menus.  I consider that this will help consumers to make healthier eating choices.  To assist the companies concerned, the FSAI has published technical instructions for Irish food business operators.  It is also in the process of developing a software tool to help Irish companies to count the calories in dishes that are on menus for more than 30 days per year.  The FSAI is currently conducting a large telephone survey and quality assessment evaluating the uptake of calorie menu labelling by Food Service Businesses in Ireland. The final survey results will be ready for publication in March 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WREE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treatment Purchase Fund","counter":4167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WREE02850"},{"type":"question","counter":4168,"qnumday":673,"qnumall":"[9817\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WREE02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the annual spend from the National Treatment Purchase Fund from 2009 to 2012 for the treatment of bilateral cochlear implants abroad; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4169,"content":"<p>No spending has been incurred by the National Treatment Purchase Fund during the period 2009 to 2012 for such treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WREE03000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":4170,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WREE03050"},{"type":"question","counter":4171,"qnumday":674,"qnumall":"[9831\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WREE03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will review an application for a medical card in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare whose financial circumstances have changed since their original application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4172,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WREE03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4173,"content":"<p>Question No. 675 answered with Question No. 617.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cochlear Implants","counter":4175,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRFF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":4176,"qnumday":676,"qnumall":"[9838\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRFF00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive intends to upgrade and enhance the audiology unit in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; if the HSE intends to make resources available to enable all children who require bilateral cochlear implants to have the essential procedure carried out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1067","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":4177,"qnumday":679,"qnumall":"[9855\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRFF00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the outcome of the business plan submission made by Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, for consideration in the 2013 Service Plan for the provision of bilateral cochlear implants; the action being taken and the timeframe involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":4178,"qnumday":714,"qnumall":"[10229\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRFF00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 671, 735 and 736 of 19 February 2013, the steps that will be put in place to deal with children who suffer late onset hearing impairment or deafness which may not be picked up in new born screening; the way this group will be affected by any decision that the Health Service Executive and Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, come to in relation to cochlear implants; if he envisages an age cut off point; if guidelines will be put in place to identify which children are suitable for bilateral implants; if he will ensure that those children who suffer from late onset hearing impairment will not be discriminated against.","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4179,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 676, 679 and 714 together.<\/p><p>  The HSE undertook a National Review of Audiology Services.

As well as its long standing links with the Mater, which can and should be retained, it would also be appropriate for the Rotunda to establish links with other hospitals to meet its future aspirations for sub-specialty development and to expand and consolidate the links which currently exist.<\/p><p><br \/>  The KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin, which was completed in 2008, noted that Dublin&#8217;s model of stand alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be co-located with adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new national paediatric hospital. The intention has been that the National Maternity Hospital should be relocated to St Vincent's, the Coombe to Tallaght and the Rotunda to the Mater, and the maternity hospitals have been working with the relevant adult sites to progress this. There will be early discussions with the maternity hospitals regarding their maternity \/adult co-location plans in the context of the Government decision to build the new children&#8217;s hospital on the St James&#8217;s campus.  Notwithstanding this, I am committed to the intent of the report - that the Dublin maternity hospitals be located alongside adult acute services - while also bearing in mind the  need to plan for the provision of tri-located paediatric , adult and maternity services, as is the intention in relation to the new children's hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRHH00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services","counter":4301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRHH00525"},{"type":"question","counter":4302,"qnumday":722,"qnumall":"[10256\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRHH00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons awaiting orthodontic treatment in County Kerry; the length of time they are waiting; the progress that has been made to reduce the waiting lists in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4303,"content":"<p>The HSE provides orthodontic treatment to patients based on their level of clinical need.

where the income guidelines are exceeded.The HSE set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.  There is an emergency process for a person who is terminally ill, or in urgent need of medical attention and cannot afford to pay for it, that provides a card within 24 hours while the normal application process is completed.Once a letter from the patient's GP or consultant is received stating that the person is terminally ill and the required personal details are provided, an emergency card is issued to that person for a six-month period.  The Programme for Government commits to reforming the current public health system by introducing Universal Health Insurance with equal access to care for all.

To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0with effect\u00a0from 1st   April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.\u00a0<\/p><p>  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee\u00a0in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport. There is significant\u00a0 scope for\u00a0achieving greater levels of transport integration and coordinated delivery across a range of Exchequer funded local and rural transport services such as school and HSE transport services.<\/p><p>  I am very aware of the very valuable work done on the ground by the RTP Groups such as Westmeath Rural Transport in ensuring that the transport needs of their local community are being identified and delivered within available resources. However, given\u00a0 resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the establishment of better alignment between the 35 RTP groups and local authorities, it is\u00a0necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised. <\/p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. \u00a0One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Coordination Units be established.\u00a0 Discussions are taking place with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the County and City Managers Association and the Rural Transport Network in the context of aligning the new structure with the local authority structure. \u00a0I would emphasise that no decision has been taken but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.<\/p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the rural transport programme will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector. \u00a0Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.   While I can understand and fully appreciate that this creates a level of uncertainty for RTP groups, I am hopeful that the outcome will be a better service delivered more efficiently. I will work with all involved over the coming months to make any transition as smooth as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRJJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driving Licences","counter":4363,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRJJ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":4364,"qnumday":747,"qnumall":"[9631\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600074#WRJJ01100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will report on the process of establishing a new system of photo capture for driving licences which has been awarded solely to the National Driver Licence Service; if there was a competitive tendering process for his new system; his views regarding the impact of the ending of photo ID services in local business including local pharmacies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":4365,"content":"<p>Following a Government decision, the driver licensing service has been centralised under the Road Safety Authority (RSA).

The Bill, which has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and is awaiting Committee Stage, does not make any provision in relation to the role or status of &quot;legal executives&quot; nor is any such provision envisaged. <\/p><p><br \/>  The proposals being made by the Irish Institute of Legal Executives Ltd on behalf of its members, are far-reaching and relate <i>inter alia<\/i>  to &quot;a right of audience in the District and Circuit Courts, before tribunals and, subject to review, subsequently in all courts&quot;, and to the eligibility of members for quasi-judicial and judicial appointments (e.g as District Court judges or as members of Tribunals).  These proposals also draw heavily from the regulatory and practise models of England and Wales which do not always correspond to those of our jurisdiction nor to those set out under current Government policy in the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011.  Under Section 30 of the Bill, provision is already made for public consultation in relation to the creation of a new profession of conveyancer.  It also remains open to legal executives, who are so minded, to pursue the career of solicitor or barrister by way of capitalising on their acquired legal knowledge and experience.<\/p><p><br \/>  While recognising that there may be additional benefits and efficiencies to be found for consumers and for the legal services sector in a more developed role for &quot;legal executives&quot;, the far-reaching proposals being made on their behalf at this time lie beyond the scope of the Legal Services Regulation Bill impinging, as they do, on aspects of the courts and the judiciary.  Such matters will, therefore, need to be considered separately on their own merits, while others may come to be considered in due course by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600075#WRY02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":4444,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600075#WRY02500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Operations","counter":4443,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600075#WRY02450"},{"type":"question","counter":4444,"qnumday":536,"qnumall":"[9821\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600075#WRY02500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the British Ministry of Defence has paid out &euro;14 million in compensation to hundreds of Iraqis with a further 700 claims on the way and if it has implications for Irish troops serving abroad.","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":4445,"content":"<p>The Defence Forces serve on Peace Support Operations as part of UN mandated missions, led by organisations such as the United Nations, the European Union or NATO.

It is one of 6 Fishery Harbour Centres operated by the State, each of whose primary purpose is to provide facilities and services for the fishing industry and fisheries-related activities.  <\/p><p>  There has been significant capital investment in the Fishery Harbour Centres in recent years, underpinning both the fisheries side and, in parallel, their expanding use for leisure and marine tourism and other maritime enterprises.  Howth in particular has a long tradition in both areas.  All of the users of the Fishery Harbour need to be accommodated in a safe and secure facility, and the Department has a duty of care towards anyone entering it.  Apart from any other considerations, the upkeep of the Harbour so that it meets with current health and safety standards has a cost and this cost must be paid for out of the income generated. <\/p><p>  In the current economic climate, the State must be fully committed to maximising the return on its investment.  Furthermore, my Department is required to ensure that the Fishery Harbour Centres are run on a financially sound basis.  <\/p><p>  With over 500 parking spaces within the boundaries of the Fishery Harbour Centre at present, it is clear that a significant source of revenue exists that could assist in balancing the books, and providing funding for enhancements that would not otherwise be possible.<\/p><p>  I am reviewing all aspects of the matter at present.  I can assure the Deputy that the views of the various harbour users, the potential earnings, the possible impact on the harbour businesses and recreational users, the impact on the local economy, the impact on overall traffic management within the Fishery Harbour, are all matters that I will take into account in coming to a decision. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600076#WRZ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Afforestation Programme","counter":4507,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600076#WRZ02950"},{"type":"question","counter":4508,"qnumday":559,"qnumall":"[9640\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600076#WRZ03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding an afforestation application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":4509,"content":"<p>The application for pre-planting approval submitted by the person named is located within a Special Protection Area (SPA) designated for the protection of the hen harrier.

These measures underpin ongoing commitment to quality and sustainability as well as to the highest standards of traceability and food safety in the Irish food sector.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600077#WRAA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Imports","counter":4535,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600077#WRAA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":4536,"qnumday":568,"qnumall":"[9683\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600077#WRAA00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the value and range of meat products, including horse meat, imported each year for the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":4537,"content":"<p>The following table, drawn from the official CSO Trade Statistics gives a breakdown of meat imports into Ireland in 2012 and 2011.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/th><th colspan=\"2\"><div><b>2011<\/b><\/div><\/th><th colspan=\"2\"><div><b>2012<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Category of Meat<\/td><td><div>&#8364; 000<\/div><\/td><td><div>Tonnes<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364; 000<\/div><\/td><td><div>Tonnes<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Poultry<\/td><td><div>284,092<\/div><\/td><td><div>85,998<\/div><\/td><td><div>326,909<\/div><\/td><td><div>99,187<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Pigmeat<\/td><td><div>214,044<\/div><\/td><td><div>79,027<\/div><\/td><td><div>243,634<\/div><\/td><td><div>81,983<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Beef<\/td><td><div>158,459<\/div><\/td><td><div>46,240<\/div><\/td><td><div>150,054<\/div><\/td><td><div>40,032<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sheepmeat<\/td><td><div>14,230<\/div><\/td><td><div>3,444<\/div><\/td><td><div>18,384<\/div><\/td><td><div>3,668<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Other Meat &amp; Meat Produce<\/td><td><div>40,739<\/div><\/td><td><div>12,193<\/div><\/td><td><div>38,700<\/div><\/td><td><div>11,331<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Including, Meat of Horses, Asses, Mules of Hinnies <\/td><td><div>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                                        \u00a0 0<\/div><\/td><td><div>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                                                     0<\/div><\/td><td><div>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                                                      5<\/div><\/td><td><div>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                                                     0*<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Grand Total<\/b><\/td><td><div><b>711,564<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div><b>226,902<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div><b>777,681<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div><b>236,201<\/b><\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>* The weight of product is too low to feature in official statistics<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600077#WRAA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Safety Authority Investigations","counter":4538,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600077#WRAA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":4539,"qnumday":569,"qnumall":"[9686\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600077#WRAA00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if, following a request from the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to his Department on the 21 of December 2012 to obtain samples of raw ingredients from two meat processing plants implicated in the adulteration of food products with horse meat, this matter was brought to his attention and to the attention of the Department of Health who has responsibility for food safety; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":4540,"content":"<p>As I indicated in my detailed statement on this matter to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 5th February, the finding of 29% equine DNA in a burger first became available to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on 11th January and was made available to my Department on 14th   January. Up to that point there was no basis for any action.  My Department was requested on 21st   December by the FSAI to obtain samples of raw ingredients in the context of the FSAI survey on the authenticity of meat products, preliminary results of which indicated traces of non-bovine DNA. My Department was requested by the FSAI not to take any other action as results were inconclusive and required further evaluation by the FSAI.

I would point out, however, that the Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to enact legislation to regulate certain practices in the grocery goods sector.  The Government intends to give effect to this commitment by including an enabling provision in the legislation currently being prepared to merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, which will allow for the introduction of a statutory Code of Practice.  Work on drafting the Consumer and Competition Bill is on-going and the Bill is included in the &ldquo;A list&rdquo; in the Government&rsquo;s current Legislative Programme.  It is important to point out that in introducing a statutory Code the intention is not to protect one stakeholder over another nor is the Code intended to prevent stakeholders such as retailers and suppliers from engaging in the type of contractual negotiations that happen in most other sectors of the economy.  It is also the case that the Code is not seeking in any way to determine the price of grocery goods. Rather, the essential value of the Code is that by regulating problematic practices in the grocery goods sector it seeks to strike a fair balance between the competing interests of the various stakeholders including the interests of the end user, the consumer.<\/p><p>  The Government is strongly of the view that it important to ensure there is balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector and that Ireland continues to have strong agri food and retail sectors, particularly given the importance of these sectors to the national economy.  The introduction of a Code of Practice, as provided for in the Programme for Government, is intended to achieve such a balance taking into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector.  It must also be noted, however, that arrangements in the domestic market are not the primary influence on farmers&rsquo; incomes.  Unsurprisingly, with an Agri-Food industry that exported over &euro;9bn of goods last year, the bulk of most Irish farmers&rsquo; produce is exported (e.g. 4 out of 5 beef cattle produced in Ireland are consumed in other countries), so EU and world prices have a much bigger influence on the price farmers receive for their output overall than does the retail price in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600077#WRAA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":4547,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600077#WRAA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":4548,"qnumday":572,"qnumall":"[9710\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600077#WRAA01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when the agri environment options scheme 1 payment will be made available to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":4549,"content":"<p>The person named was approved for participation in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme with effect from the 1st September 2010 and full payments totalling &euro;608.11 and &euro;4,195.14 issued in respect of 2010 and 2011 respectively.

An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is working to address this issue, particularly as oil prices increase and the cost of sending trawlers full of fish to Spain, France, Scotland and Norway becomes less economical.  With the increase in the Blue whiting quota for 2013, it is anticipated that there will be increased levels of this stock landed into Ireland by foreign vessels.  I understand that negotiations are ongoing between representatives of the French fishing industry and Irish processing interests, with a view to increasing French landings into Ireland.  A pilot initiative was developed between BIM, Irish processors and French industry during late 2012.  All concerned are seeking to build on the success of this initiative in 2013.<\/p><p>  In relation to official controls carried out by the SFPA these are done in order to discharge Ireland's obligations under the Framework for the control of the Common Fisheries Policy in EU Waters  as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1224\/2009, establishing a Community control system to ensure compliance with the rules of the CFP and Council Regulation (EC) No 1005\/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.  Detailed rules for the implementation of the control regulation are set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404\/2011, and I have implemented these in national law through Statutory Instrument 320 of 2012 as amended.  This is the regulatory EU framework against which the SFPA carries out its inspection regime.<\/p><p>  These regulations contain an explicit default obligation requiring that all fish be weighed by operators at the point of landing.  In order to ensure a reasonable balance between the burden of compliance and the practicalities of fish landing, SFPA has pursued and achieved approval for landings to Ireland to avail of various derogations.  These allow, in particular for a sample weighing at landing, or a weighing after transport to an Irish premises.  In the case of landings to a Member State for transport to another Member State before weighing, the EU Regulation is prescriptive in only allowing that to occur under the terms of a Common Control Programme agreed between the landing MS and the weighing MS. I am pleased to inform you that due to active engagement by the SFPA with their French counterparts as part of overall pursuit of a level playing field for fisheries control, the EU Commission has approved the Common Control programme between Ireland and France, and anyone landing to Ireland may transport their fish directly to France for weighing, provided they work within the terms of this approved CCP.  The SFPA have engaged in a specific compliance programme including active dialogue with industry stakeholders, with view to discharging Ireland&rsquo;s obligations in this regard.<\/p><p>  At the request of the industry, I have recently added Castletownbere to the list of Irish ports at which third country landings can be processed and this is aimed  to facilitate  an increase in landings of Blue Whiting into Ireland by the Norwegian fleet.  This is contained in S.I 367 of 2012 Sea-Fisheries (Illegal, Unreported And Unregulated Fishing) (Amendment) Regulations 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600077#WRAA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Afforestation Programme","counter":4577,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600077#WRAA03350"},{"type":"question","counter":4578,"qnumday":582,"qnumall":"[9870\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600077#WRAA03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding further afforestation at a location (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":4579,"content":"<p>The Mullaghareirk is located within a Special Protection Area (SPA) designated for the protection of the hen harrier where restrictions apply to planting and other developments.

I am aware that sheep prices for the year 2013 to date are disappointing for producers and are running at around 17% below the 2012 level for the corresponding period. This decline is reflected also in other EU member states and can be attributed to a number of factors including increased imports from New Zealand and the impact of austerity in Europe on demand generally. However, I would like to put the current difficulties in context.<\/p><p>  After successive years of decline, 2011\/12 saw an important turning point for the Irish sheep industry.  It was a period when confidence grew on the back of incremental growth in the national breeding flock.  This brought about increased throughput at farm and processing level. During that same period Irish sheep exports delivered double digit growth and retail sales of Irish lamb have grown steadily. These developments are in sharp contrast to other Member States, where sheep meat production and domestic consumption have been falling.  <\/p><p>  Throughout 2012 a higher demand from both the domestic and export markets were evenly matched with supplies, particularly during the peak periods of hogget and main season lamb supply.  Slaughterings in 2012 were up 12%, or 260,000 head to 2.43 million sheep.  This included 68,000 extra hoggets, 160,000 extra lambs and 32,000 additional ewes and rams slaughtered in 2012.   <\/p><p>  On another positive note, exports of Irish sheep meat registered a solid performance in 2012 where total value rose by 7% to &euro;205 million.  Seventy percent of our production was exported, the vast majority of which was destined for the EU market.  Just over 42,000 tonnes were exported to over 24 individual markets across the globe in 2012. France and the UK continue to be our core export markets representing three quarters of our volume exports.  Strong increases in shipments were recorded to Belgium, Germany and Sweden as exporters continue to secure new business and grow volume with existing customers. Despite the ongoing pressure on retail meat sales in Ireland, lamb held its own, with data from Kantar Worldpanel showing a rise of almost 4.5% for the 52 week period ending November 2012.<\/p><p>  Tighter global supplies that characterised the sheepmeat markets in 2011\/12 have eased slightly as global production edges up 1% to 13.6 million.  Good pastures and favourable lambing conditions in Australia and New Zealand have reversed four years of declining output. Production in both countries is forecast to grow by 3-5% this year. Due to the ongoing austerity in Europe and with an increase in the availability of cheaper lamb from the southern hemisphere, in comparison with 12 months ago, the price differential between New Zealand and EU lamb has been widening since summer 2012.  The carryover of UK hoggets into 2013 has also put downward pressure on prices in the early months of 2013. <\/p><p>  Today&rsquo;s consumer seeks value and is prepared to switch to a cheaper protein option.  Lamb is perceived as a relatively expensive meat and Bord Bia promotion campaigns play an important role in positioning lamb as a preferred choice. Increasing the frequency of purchase of Irish lamb and encouraging shoppers to look for the Bord Bia Quality Mark on-pack when shopping will be the key objective of the Bord Bia 2013 lamb promotions. Promotional activities will include radio advertising, which will be undertaken around Easter, announcing the arrival of early season lamb amongst consumers. Similarly, a series of promotional activities to include PR, publicity and in-store activities will be undertaken to coincide with peak availability of new season lamb. The TV advert highlighting the unique flavour of Irish lamb due to our ideal climate will play a central role in our 2013 promotions.<\/p><p>  Overall numbers of lamb producers in the Bord Bia Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme (LQAS) stand at just over 9,300, which roughly equates to 45% of our national throughput.  I recently launched the Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP), which I believe will be a key element in driving the ambitious target for the sheepmeat Sector in Food Harvest 2020. The STAP is intended to provide participants with the knowledge and the skills necessary to improve on-farm technical efficiency in a number of key areas. The sheep sector is a key part of the Agrifood sector, especially in marginal land areas and there is huge scope to improve farm incomes through focusing on issues such as grassland management, financial management, breeding, health and welfare and environmental efficiency. The STAP provides an opportunity to grow the membership base of the LQAS amongst lamb producers, while also promoting the adoption by farmers of best practice in the various aspects of sheep farming. I have allocated &euro;3 million to the STAP for 2013, with a maximum payment of &euro;1,000 per participant. Though the Grassland Sheep Scheme was due to expire at the end of 2012, I decided to extend it for another year and am providing some &euro;14 million for this purpose in 2013. The scheme will be funded from unspent Single Farm Payment funds. I am also providing for a continuation of the sheep fencing scheme in the amount of &euro;3 million this year to enable many farmers in the sheep sector to complete the necessary investment works in order to maintain competitiveness and introduce increased efficiencies on their farm and so secure the future of their enterprises.  I am confident that all of these initiatives will be of significant assistance in developing a strong and sustainable sheep sector for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600078#WRBB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":4627,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600078#WRBB02350"},{"type":"question","counter":4628,"qnumday":599,"qnumall":"[10240\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600078#WRBB02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the total number of farmers in the beef technology scheme in County Galway yet to be paid; if his attention has been drawn to an issue in relation to data inputting which appears to be causing a problem and which is putting farmers under severe pressure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":4629,"content":"<p>Under Food Harvest 2020, ambitious development targets were set for a number of agricultural sectors, including the beef sector.

My Department maintains a permanent presence in approved slaughter plants. Regular visits are made to other Department approved meat plants. The frequency of these inspections in plants other than slaughter plants, which focus primarily on food safety requirements, is determined by a risk assessment, as required under EU legislation, which is conducted for each plant. My Department has been able to reduce the number of inspections at non-slaughter meat plants, where there is no permanent supervisory presence, by moving to a more robust and rigorous targeted system of official controls, based on the risk assessments mentioned above. Official controls and inspections levels are monitored independently by the EU Food and Veterinary Office and by the FSAI under service contract. <\/p><p>  Food business operators in Ireland are responsible inter alia for carrying out checks to ensure that their ingredients come from approved plants. In meat plants that operate under the supervision of the Department, official controls are conducted on these checks to verify their effectiveness. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. Labelling and documentary checks also form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. <\/p><p>  Under the Department&rsquo;s National Residue Programme, and including tests on bovine samples carried out by processors, up to 30,000 samples taken at farm and factory level and covering a wide range of food stuffs are tested annually. These tests relate to microbiological and chemical standards, their primary focus being on food safety. These are fully in accordance with EU testing requirements.  <\/p><p>  In addition the Product Official Sampling and Testing (POST) programme is a microbiological testing programme on samples taken from Department approved ready-to-eat food, meat product, minced meat and meat preparation plants i.e. added value plants. This is part of the official verification of food safety controls in the plants concerned as provided for in Regulations (EC) 852\/2004, 854\/2004 and 2073\/2005. A total of 1,600 samples are taken annually and the sampling and testing is risk based.<\/p><p>  The number of inspections has not been found to be inadequate as compliance with existing food safety and food hygiene requirements was not an issue in relation to the mislabelling of meat products uncovered by the recent FSAI survey. It is clear however that the focus of checks henceforth will also need to include food authenticity and the EU wide programme of DNA testing recently agreed will provide the basis for consideration of future action in this respect.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, in the light of recent developments, officials from my Department and the FSAI met with the meat processing sector on 14th  February to agree a national protocol for DNA testing of meat to be applied at retail, catering and processing level in Ireland. This testing will provide further reassurance to Irish consumers and consumers of Irish food abroad about the authenticity of ingredients in our meat based products. DNA testing will apply from now on as part of routine food testing across the country. The following categories of food are being tested &ndash; pre-packaged beef products on sale to the final consumer or to mass caterers, beef products offered for sale without pre-packaging to consumers or to mass caterers and meat ingredients used in processed beef products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600078#WRBB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":4636,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600078#WRBB02950"},{"type":"question","counter":4637,"qnumday":602,"qnumall":"[10421\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600078#WRBB03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Cavan will be paid their funding under the animal welfare scheme farm discussion group for 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":4638,"content":"<p>In order to qualify for the 2012 Beef Technology Adoption Programme, applicants were required to have satisfied one of the following two criteria:<\/p><p>- Farmers with suckler cows must be current participants in the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme (AWRBS), that is, they must have received payments under the Scheme on 2010 born calves <b>and<\/b> have applied to participate in ICBF HerdPlus prior to applying for the Programme.  <\/p><p>- Beef farmers without a suckler herd must have applied to participate in ICBF HerdPlus prior to applying for the Programme.

One of these measures related to the number of weeks over which the free pre-school year could be provided.  At that time, approximately 30% of children in the relevant age-cohort were in full daycare.  Therefore, in order to facilitate full daycare services in the early years of the programme, services were permitted to choose between providing a 38 week or a 50 week model.<\/p><p>  I should emphasise that the ECCE programme is designed as an educational programme for children.  It was always intended, once the programme had bedded-down, to introduce a standard 38 week model.  This is primarily because this is the optimal model in terms of ensuring a high-quality early years experience for pre-school children.  The S&iacute;olta and Aistear frameworks were developed to support this objective. The ECCE programme is designed to be delivered across 38 weeks.  It is difficult to see how the curriculum can be delivered across a 50 week period when the children spend less time (generally 2 hours 15 minutes per day) availing of it.<\/p><p>  My focus is on improving the quality of childcare services.  For this reason, therefore, services participating in the ECCE programme are now required to provide the programme on the basis of 3 hours per day, 5 days per week, over 38 weeks. It is not mandatory that children attend every day but, where they do not, the capitation fee is reduced accordingly.   <\/p><p>  The change to the 38 week model only was introduced in September 2012 and all participating services have successfully made the transition to the new arrangement.

It is my intention that the Agency will have a role in supporting families and communities.

The FSA, like all other State bodies, has been asked to make savings across all the programmes which it administers.

The intern year is an integral part of medical training and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.   Under the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 it is a matter for the HSE to assess, on an annual basis, the number of intern training posts required by the health service.  <\/p><p>  There were 572 intern posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. All 2012 EU graduates from Irish medical schools who sought an intern post here that year and met the HSE eligibility criteria were successful in securing a post. Indeed, to date there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools and a number of additional posts for some non-EU applicants. <\/p><p>  My Department is in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish\/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  It should be noted that under EU law intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying. <\/p><p>  The Higher Education Authority has indicated that the number of medical graduates this year has not yet been finalised. However, the application process for internships commencing in July 2013 closed in November last. A total of 960 eligible applications were received, 652 from EEA applicants and 308 from non-EEA applicants. There is no separate figure available for Irish applicants. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test; meet the HSE English language requirements; provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate; and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams. <\/p><p>  The HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July 2013. In total there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013 and the HSE consider that there will be sufficient capacity and funding to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600079#WRCC04100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Primary Care","counter":4717,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600079#WRCC04150"},{"type":"question","counter":4718,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[9609\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600079#WRCC04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the competition issues that have arisen with regard to the introduction of universal primary care; the discussions that have taken place with other Government Departments and agencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4719,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government provides for significant strengthening of primary care services to achieve Universal Primary Care (UPC) with the removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients.

Part of the debate about the future of our health system overall has been about the most appropriate role for the private sector, and the balance to be drawn between it and the public and voluntary sectors.  The Government is committed to the continued development of a mixed health care system in Ireland, drawing on the strengths of all three sectors.  That said, we are committed to the development of a single-tier health service, in which the distinction between &lsquo;public&rsquo; and &lsquo;private&rsquo; patient is removed.  We can no longer accept a situation where patients can queue-jump because they can afford to pay for faster access.<\/p><p>  Within this context, I believe that the free market has an important role to play, provided that the system is regulated effectively to protect quality and to control costs. For example, private hospitals play an important role in delivering acute services in Ireland, and private companies also deliver community based services, such as home supports for older people.  The move to Universal Health Insurance will involve a very important role for the private sector, in which health insurers will compete for business in a manner designed to drive efficiencies and offer customers choice between funders of health care. While the overall approach to reform will be informed by the experience of other countries and best practice the system as a whole will be uniquely Irish.  Whatever the precise configuration of services as between public, voluntary and private, and whatever the exact role of a regulated free market within the system, my priority is to ensure that all patients and clients receive the best possible service for the lowest cost, in the setting that is most appropriate to their needs. The reform of our health system will be developed on these principles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600080#WRDD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres","counter":4736,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600080#WRDD00750"},{"type":"question","counter":4737,"qnumday":635,"qnumall":"[9624\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600080#WRDD00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1052 of 16 January 2013, if he will confirm the exact date in June 2012 that the development of a primary care centre at Deanrock, Togher, Cork City, was added to the public private partnership list and to confirm the person who made this decision.","asker":"993","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4738,"content":"<p>Delivery of healthcare infrastructure is a service matter.

A total of 27 beef burger products were analysed.  The FSAI then arranged further intense testing of the samples to validate the correctness of the initial analysis and to quantify the amount of horse DNA in each sample - the results of these tests were received on 11 January 2013. These results showed that, of the 10 burgers found to contain horse DNA, one contained 29% horsemeat, another 0.3% and the remainder had less than 0.1%. Traces of horse DNA were also detected in batches of raw ingredients, including some imported from other Member States.

It is neither intended nor anticipated that the Rotunda will be constrained by being positioned within a particular group.  As well as its long standing links with the Mater, which can and should be retained, it would also be appropriate for the Rotunda to establish links with other hospitals to meet its future aspirations for sub-specialty development and to expand and consolidate the links which currently exist.<\/p><p><br \/>  With regard to the framework within which maternity services are delivered, the Deputy refers to the KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin Area and to a review of maternity models of care. The KPMG report, which was completed in 2008, noted that Dublin&#8217;s model of stand alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be co-located with adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new national paediatric hospital.  In regard to the review of maternity models of care referred to by the Deputy, work is currently ongoing in the HSE's Clinical Programme for Obstetrics and Gynaecology  on the development of models of care for maternity services, which includes a review of current models with the development of a proposal for future developments. Both the KPMG report and the review to be carried out by the Clinical Programme will inform the delivery of maternity services in Dublin and nationally, as appropriate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600080#WRDD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":4777,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600080#WRDD03650"},{"type":"question","counter":4778,"qnumday":651,"qnumall":"[9720\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600080#WRDD03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an early date for a hip operation will be arranged in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Carlow","asker":"965","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4779,"content":"<p>The management of inpatient and daycase waiting lists for patients awaiting public health care is based on the principle that after urgent and cancer patients are treated, then clinically assessed routine patients should be seen in chronological order (i.e. longest waiter first).

The Department will meet with the FSAI prior to the May meeting to ensure that Irish health policy is reflected during those discussions.  In 2012, my Department requested the FSAI to conduct a national consultation on the display of calories on menus.  Over 95% of respondents expressed their support for this initiative.  I then wrote personally to a range of fast food restaurants requesting that they display calories on menus on a voluntary basis.  Recent monitoring information from the FSAI, found that almost half of the 19 fast food restaurants, coffee shops and catering companies are now displaying calories on menus.  I consider that this will help consumers to make healthier eating choices.  To assist the companies concerned, the FSAI has published technical instructions for Irish food business operators.

While no dedicated programme for simultaneous or sequential cochlear implantation is being carried out in Ireland at this time, some bilateral implantation has already occurred for patients, mainly very young children with certain medical conditions such as a history of meningitis or blindness. It is estimated that there are approximately 200 children in Ireland today who may be suitable for a second implant. Not all suitable patients proceed with the second implant when appraised of all the issues involved.<\/p><p>  I am aware that Beaumont Hospital, HSE Management and the HSE&rsquo;s Audiology Clinical Care Programme have met recently to discuss a joint process to identify the options for developing and resourcing a programme of simultaneous and sequential cochlear implantation.

where the income guidelines are exceeded.The HSE set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.  There is an emergency process for a person who is terminally ill, or in urgent need of medical attention and cannot afford to pay for it, that provides a card within 24 hours while the normal application process is completed.Once a letter from the patient's GP or consultant is received stating that the person is terminally ill and the required personal details are provided, an emergency card is issued to that person for a six-month period.  The Programme for Government commits to reforming the current public health system by introducing Universal Health Insurance with equal access to care for all.  As part of this, the Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, GP care without fees within its first term of office. Primary legislation is required to give effect to Government commitment to introduce a universal GP service without fees.<\/p><p>Legislation to allow the Minister for Health to make regulations to extend access to GP services without fees to persons with prescribed illnesses is currently being drafted by the Office of the Attorney General and the Department and it will be published shortly. Implementation dates and application details will be announced in due course.  There are no plans to abolish the LTI scheme and give medical cards to patients with defined long term illnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600084#WRHH02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Review","counter":4981,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600084#WRHH02250"},{"type":"question","counter":4982,"qnumday":732,"qnumall":"[10282\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600084#WRHH02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the total cost of assessing persons for eligibility for medical cards for the years 2009 to 2012 inclusive","asker":"1067","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4983,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available.

To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0with effect\u00a0from 1st   April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.\u00a0<\/p><p>  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee\u00a0in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport. There is significant\u00a0 scope for\u00a0achieving greater levels of transport integration and coordinated delivery across a range of Exchequer funded local and rural transport services such as school and HSE transport services.<\/p><p>  I am very aware of the very valuable work done on the ground by the RTP Groups such as Westmeath Rural Transport in ensuring that the transport needs of their local community are being identified and delivered within available resources. However, given\u00a0 resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the establishment of better alignment between the 35 RTP groups and local authorities, it is\u00a0necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised. <\/p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. \u00a0One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Coordination Units be established.\u00a0 Discussions are taking place with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the County and City Managers Association and the Rural Transport Network in the context of aligning the new structure with the local authority structure. \u00a0I would emphasise that no decision has been taken but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.<\/p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the rural transport programme will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector. \u00a0Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.   While I can understand and fully appreciate that this creates a level of uncertainty for RTP groups, I am hopeful that the outcome will be a better service delivered more efficiently. I will work with all involved over the coming months to make any transition as smooth as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600085#WRJJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driving Licences","counter":5019,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600085#WRJJ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":5020,"qnumday":747,"qnumall":"[9631\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022600085#WRJJ01100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will report on the process of establishing a new system of photo capture for driving licences which has been awarded solely to the National Driver Licence Service; if there was a competitive tendering process for his new system; his views regarding the impact of the ending of photo ID services in local business including local pharmacies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":5021,"content":"<p>Following a Government decision, the driver licensing service has been centralised under the Road Safety Authority (RSA).
