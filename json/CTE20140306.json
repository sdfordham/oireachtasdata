The collection of information on forests will also provide information to the Minister on how forests are being managed and will help to determine the direction of future policy, including the provision of financial support and incentives.<\/p><p>  I have listened to stakeholders' comments and I am introducing amendment No. 56, which highlights the main information that forest owners may be required to supply.  The collection of data will mainly relate to information on timber felled.  I believe that the amendment while not addressing all the issues of concern to landowners does go some way to reducing the burden on them.  I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 57 and 58.  I reiterate the importance of the legislative provision in this regard for the collection of statistical information on the national forestry estate which complements national and EU reporting requirements.  For this reason I cannot agree to the removal of the section.  Although owners or managers may be required to furnish such information within 28 days, a longer period will be specified in such notices depending on the practicality of complying with such information.  For example, when a licence is issued to fell timber the forest owners may be required to provide information on the trees actually felled and confirm that replanting has taken place as specified in the licence.  This information is important to determine the level of felling activity and replanting that has taken place in connection with the licences that have issued.  The timelines required to provide such information will depend on several factors, such as the level of felling activity or the size of the property.  I emphasise that any timelines specified in any notice will provide sufficient time for forest owners to compile such information.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the Deputy's intention in amendments Nos. 59 and 60 to limit the 28 day requirement to investigate the alleged offences.  My preference is to stick with my amended wording for the section.  Although owners or managers may be required to furnish information within 28 days, I assure Deputies that a longer period will be specified in notices where the practicality of complying with such information demand it.  It is not my intention to place unreasonable demands on anyone and the timescale for receipt of information will reflect the complexity and the need to collate the information required.<\/p><p>  I believe the proposal in amendment No. 61 to limit the requirements to information that is readily available is far too loose and would make the provision of information discretionary rather than mandatory.  Under the proposed wording a person could, at any time, claim that the information was not available.<\/p><p>  The amendment in respect of commercial sensitivity of information supplied is also subjective and could obstruct the investigation of alleged offences or compliance with the relevant statutory provisions by authorised officers.  In the circumstances I cannot agree to this amendment.<\/p><p>  Under amendment No. 62, I am reducing the fine which applies to a person who fails to comply with a request under the section from a class A fine to a class E fine, that is, a reduction from &euro;5,000 to &euro;500.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014030600003#B00100","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1394098200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>My amendments are Nos. 58 and 61.  I often wonder what happens to all the statistics collected and whether decisions really get changed based on all the mounds of statistics collected.  I also often wonder whether the Minister has the staff to deal with all the statistics collected or has the information become something that gathers in rooms and dark places and keeps mounting more and more as more and more detailed information is sought?<\/p><p>  It is interesting that when the State wants something there is a time limit but when a person wants something from the State there is rarely a time limit.  There are times limits on some things.  One must appeal within 28 days but the appeal may not be decided on by the Department for a year.  One must provide information within 28 days but when one is looking for a decision on a felling licence or whatever it is not half as time-limited.<\/p><p>  Will the Minister of State get me some detail on the absolute minimum European requirements that a person must collect before Report Stage?  He may tell me that I could find it myself and I probably could but he knows where it is.  It is rather like looking for a particular tree in the forest in that if the Minister of State knows where the tree is, he may as well save me the time of examining every tree in the forest.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State said that the my proposed provision regarding commercially sensitive information is too loosely worded.  However, it seems strange that he will know the volume, the potential end product and the variety of timber sawn, converted, processed, bought, sold or otherwise disposed of within a specific period.  Sections 13(1) states that the Minister \"may\" do such and such.  However, what will happen is that every relevant person, whether the owner or manager of a forest or the owner or manager of a timber mill, will have to provide all of this information as a matter of routine.  I often wonder what the Department will do with all of it.  Does the Department have the staff to collate all of this and use it in any meaningful way?  I take it that the provisions mean the information will have to be provided and that it is not only a question of how frequently the Department seeks all the information but that it will demand it.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State said something that every Minister in his position tends to say.  He said that he has no intention of doing X, Y and Z.  We pass laws in the House on the basis that we do not know who will be in the Minister of State's position in future or what attitude that person will take to the legal provisions.  Therefore, the attitude of a particular Minister who might be before the committee does not really count when we are making legislation because we are legislating for the eventuality that different people will hold ministerial office and they might do what it is legally possible to do although it may not be the Minister of State's intention to do those things.  Therefore, it is not any defence for the Minister of State to say he will not do it.  I accept the good faith of the Minster of State but that is irrelevant because this is law, it is not simply what the Minister of State might do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014030600003#B00200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1394098200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett, you are nominated as a substitute for Deputy Pringle.

It is important to bear this in mind.<\/p><p>  Is firewood included in the provisions of section 13(1)(b)?  There is a big market for firewood in Ireland.  We are very careful to ensure that the beef market in Ireland is regulated and is supplied by people who engage actively in the beef industry.  The same applies to the milk industry.  This committee debated whether raw milk should be allowed to be sold.  Many people have wood-burning stoves and the market for firewood has increased dramatically across the country.  That market should be supplied by active wood-farmers, people who grow a crop and want to sell it.  Does the definition of an owner-manager of a timber processing business or a dealer in timber, include a dealer in firewood?  It would be very wrong if people who go to the trouble of growing a commercial crop - thinnings can be sold for a number of purposes including firewood - were to be put on the back foot by unlawful or illegal felling.<\/p><p>  With regard to the amendment which changes a class A fine to a class E fine, a fine of &euro;500 is not a lot of money.

It is obviously a legitimate exercise, particularly in view of the fact that it protects forests.  In order to be lawful at all, any interference with private property must be for the common good.  The removal of vegetation, as envisaged, would be for the common good, but I am concerned about the absence of compensation.  I accept that what is contained in the Bill mirrors the provisions of the 1946 Act and that there is a presumption of constitutionality in both instruments.  However, there have been such presumptions in respect of many matters and these have been overturned by the Supreme Court.  I flagged this matter on the previous occasion.

It allows the Minister to serve a notice on a landowner requiring him or her to take specified action to protect trees from damage by vermin.  Where land is unoccupied or the owner fails to comply with such notice, the Minister may authorise a person to enter the land and deal with the particular species.

It is important that the power to remove vermin which present a threat to forestry remains within the legislation, but such power should also be reasonably applied and recognise the difficulties involved in removing the threat completely.

If we look at what the Minister is doing here, there are two approaches.  The first is what I would call the legislative approach to which county councils have to adhere in planning.  It is the eight weeks approach, that is, eight weeks from the time one put in the last information.  If there is a further information request, it is eight weeks from the time the further information is submitted.  That works.  If the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, or anyone else wants to make an observation, they simply have to get it in on time.  It is not a big deal.  The citizen is owed that duty from the State, namely, people can come back in a timely manner and give their opinion.  If it can be done for all planning permission applications, I cannot understand why it cannot be done here for a felling licence application.<\/p><p>  The second approach is what I would call the An Bord Plean&aacute;la approach.  As the Minister is probably aware, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has a statutory objective, similar to the Minister's proposal, to do this within four months but that is observed assiduously in the breach on every occasion.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la appeals, even on a single house, can take up to a year or more to decide and there is no sense of urgency on its part.  It sends out a letter stating it cannot do it within the guidelines of the statutory objective, that it is sorry, and that it will take as long as a piece of string, so to speak, before it is addressed.  After six months it might send out another letter stating it still cannot do it within the statutory objective, that it cannot do it without the statutory objective and that it will extend the period again.  I understand the Minister's good intention in this measure but in legal terms what he is proposing is worthless because it adds more to the bureaucracy and people will continue to get these letters stating the period will be extended again.<\/p><p>  I am opposed to this and I will table an amendment to my amendment No. 78 on Report Stage stating that all licence decisions will issue within eight weeks of the required information being provided by the applicant.

I have considered the submissions made by the stakeholders and I am tabling an amendment to increase the duration of a felling licence from five to ten years.  The Bill will still allow for further extensions of up to five years in effect providing the possibility to have a licence for a period of 15 years in total.  That will allow a number of thinning operations to take place.  This is a significant change to the Bill and will provide greater flexibility for forest owners to carry out multiple harvesting events over a longer period in accordance with good forest practice.  I am also conscious of the need to strike a balance between long-term forest management and the need for sufficient safeguards to cater for a change in environmental circumstances.  Other sections of the Bill, such as section 7(2), provide these safeguards.  In extreme cases a licence could be suspended where unforeseen circumstances have occurred, for example, a large siltation event impacting negatively on a water course.  However, as I have stated previously, forest owners who require the flexibility to manage their forest over a long period would need to adopt changes if required.  I believe the provision in this Bill provides these safeguards to allow felling licence duration to be extended as proposed.<\/p><p>  All forestry harvesting operations, including thinning, have the capacity to cause significant environmental damage and some level of control over such activities must be in place.  I believe my amendment to this section allowing the Minister to issue a felling licence for up to ten years is fair.  In addition, the provision of licences for thinning and clearfell will facilitate growers in forest certification and other traceability systems.

There is a further provision that no felling licence is required where a tree is removed by a public authority in the performance of its statutory duties.  That is also sensible.  However, I do not accept that every read within 10 m of a public road poses a risk to the public.  If that is the case, the NRA has wasted a great deal of money over the last ten years.  If one drives from Galway to Dublin on the M6 or from Limerick to Dublin on the M7, one sees a great many trees which have been planted at taxpayers' expense along the motorways.  Every tree within 10 m of a public road either poses a risk or it does not.  Some trees clearly poses risks.  Many trees which are standing should be got rid of.  However, as I said on Second Stage, I have seen many trees cut down beside public roads in Clare which posed no risk to anyone.<\/p><p>  I question the purpose of the provision.  Are we talking about cutting down trees because they pose a risk to the public or are we talking about cutting down trees for firewood?  I have seen many more trees cut down for firewood near public roads than have been cut down because of a risk to the public.  I have no qualms about the fact that trees must be cut down if they are dangerous.  I do not consider, however, that every tree within 10 m of a public road poses a risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014030600009#H01000","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1394101500,"counter":186,"content":"<p>The section is being introduced to allow landowners to manage trees adjoining public roads without the requirement for a felling licence.

Where trees are overhanging a road and there is a requirement on the property owner to cut them down on foot of a health and safety risk, it is virtually impossible for that property owner to act.  He or she would have to stop the whole road.  It should really be the local authority which has the responsibility for doing it.  A complicated balance is involved.  Certainly, the idea that one could have free rein to cut down any tree within 10 m of a public road means trees that should not be cut down will be.

There is a contradiction inherent in the Bill, although the Minister of State might say otherwise.  I am reiterating what I said earlier.  It is very important that hedgerows can be cut and that trees of a certain size can be cut as part of a hedgerow.  Otherwise, it is not possible to do it, and farmers have a problem in that when they are cutting a hedgerow, if there is a sapling that has been growing for four or five years, they might be in trouble for cutting it.

There is a problem with the criteria for making decisions on what can be cut down and it needs to be examined.  Perhaps there is no perfect solution.  The person in question is from Mullingar and the issue never even occurred to me beforehand.  That said, some roads near the edge of my constituency towards the mountains experience these problems.  Clearly the local authority must have a role in assessing what is dangerous and a responsibility to assist property owners on the basis of the common good.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State should take all of these points on board.  I certainly must consider some of them.

The amount of timber in 15 cubic metres is very little.  We have to distinguish between active and passive farming.  If one is growing trees as a crop, one should be able to thin out the forest and use the timber for firewood and also for sale as firewood.  This Bill is unique in terms of Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine policy in that it does not differentiate between active and passive farmers.  Farmers who grow a crop should have as little as possible to limit what they can do with the crop.  In terms of forestry, this should mean that they can cut down trees for use as firewood, either for themselves or for sale.  That is one element of the Bill.  The Bill is limited to trees outside afforestation.  If one goes to the trouble of planting a forest, one cannot cut the trees for one's own use, but if one has an oak tree that is 800 years old on the farm, it can be cut and put into the wood burner.  In my view, that is nonsensical.  It is allowing people who have mature beech, oak, or ash on the land to cut it to supply a firewood market in the local town while a person who has 200 acres of forestry cannot cut trees or even use the thinnings to supply the firewood market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014030600013#M00900","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1394103900,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Will the Deputy clarify what he means when he said they cannot cut or even use the thinnings?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014030600013#M01000","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1394103900,"counter":295,"content":"<p>The person must apply for a felling licence.

That undermined the bank's confidence in the grant because the accumulation of even a very small amount of money over 20 years amounts to a considerable amount of money.  The banks then get concerned as to whether these grants are worth the paper they are written on given that the Department can come after the person who got the grant well into the future.  The five-year retrospection on the LPIS is a warning to all of us as to what can happen.<\/p><p>  The Bill allows for up to 20 years for somebody to come back with a better measuring tape on something that was approved for a grant, claim there was a miscalculation and ask for the money back.  It is outrageous and will undermine not only the confidence of farmers investing in forestry but will also undermine the confidence of financial institutions lending money to people to invest because banks are always worried that a grant might be clawed back.  If somebody is overpaid by &euro;500 each year for 20 years, the person can suddenly get a bill for &euro;10,000.

No. 125 of 2012)&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>This amendment - to sections 5 and 7 of the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001 - involves technical changes to allow for the ongoing updating of the list of schemes that come within the remit of the agriculture appeals office and to extend the office's remit to include, in a new Schedule 2, appeals against felling and aerial fertilisation licence decisions and consents that are not covered by the various forestry schemes.  While this is a lengthy amendment to the original text of the Bill, it is important to stress that it does not alter in any way the purpose of the original provision which is to have all forestry appeals dealt with by the independent agriculture appeals office.<\/p><p>  The only distinction being made is that scheme applications - including afforestation, roads and woodland improvement - will be dealt with by the agriculture appeals office in the very same way as most other agriculture scheme appeals, while appeals against licence and consent decisions will be dealt with by a forestry appeals committee appointed by the Minister, as provided for under section 14A, under the auspices of the agriculture appeals office.  Similar committee systems already operate on an <i>ad-hoc<\/i> basis to deal with various aspects of the single payment and disadvantaged areas schemes.  This committee system has worked effectively and efficiently for such appeals and I envisage that the forestry appeals committee will operate equally well.  The chairman and members of the forestry appeals committee will be appointed by the Minister and while it is not specified as to who should be chairman or who should serve on the committee, the appointment of officers of the Department is not precluded.  The composition of the committee may comprise a mix of departmental and private individuals as was the case with the single payment appeals and disadvantaged areas scheme appeals committees.  Decisions on such appointments will be made at the appropriate time and I will keep an open mind as to the composition of the membership of the committee and the appointment of its chairman.<\/p><p>  Members may ask why we are distinguishing between scheme applications and such licence applications.  The reason for this relates to the original purpose for which the appeals office was established, which was to consider and make determinations on appeals in respect of applications for entitlement under various schemes operated by the Department.  The extension of the Agriculture Appeals Act proposed in the amendment will for the first time bring under the remit of the appeals office the consideration - on appeal - of licence applications.  It is the view of the appeals office, in light of its experience with the operation of committees, that these appeals would best be considered within the context of a committee which can deal efficiently and effectively with complex issues and draw on the necessary expertise from other resources.<\/p><p>  As regards amendment number 99, section 6 of the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001 provides that &quot;Appeals Officers shall, subject to this Act, be independent in the performance of their functions&quot;.  As a result, there is no need for the amendment because the matter to which it refers it is already adequately provided for in the 2001 Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014030600017#Q00800","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1394106300,"counter":385,"content":"<p>It is good that there will be a forestry appeals committee.  However, independence and composition are two important considerations in that regard.  In light of what the Minister of State just said and in view of what is concerned in the amendment, I am of the view that it should be stipulated that stakeholders should be involved.  Given that we are dealing with issues which affect farmers, they should be represented.  In addition and given that there are also issues relating to the environment involved here, why is it not stipulated that environmental experts should serve on the appeals committee?  There are probably other stakeholders who should also be involved.  The Minister should not have a free hand.  What is proposed somewhat resembles an insider appeals mechanism.  In other words, the appeals committee will comprise individuals similar to those who will make the decisions in the first instance.
