A number of Senators from across the House attended a good briefing on the matter this summer.  I wonder whether in the next couple of weeks the Leader could find time to schedule that because it would be an important debate.  I will leave that with him but I ask him to try to find time for it.<\/p><p>I have raised on four occasions the vacancy in the area of paediatric cystic fibrosis at Temple Street Children's Hospital, where 94 children attend on a regular basis for cystic fibrosis physiotherapy.  I raised it directly with the Minister, Deputy Reilly, when he was here.  My colleague, Deputy Kelleher, has tabled parliamentary questions on the matter.  As I stated, I have raised it here on two separate occasions with the Minister and also with the Leader.  I am glad the Minister responded by saying that the vacancy would be filled, but he provided no timeframe.  The post has been vacant since the start of September.  The Minister also said, to this House and to me - this is where I want clarification - that children who require cystic fibrosis physiotherapy will be seen.  A number of parents have been in touch with me about this, and that is not true at all.  One of the parents with whom I was involved had an appointment on 10 October, and that appointment was cancelled.  Other parents have also had their appointments for necessary physiotherapy treatment for their children cancelled.  As anyone who is familiar with cystic fibrosis will be aware, early intervention can extend the lifespan of an affected child substantially.  The only circumstance in which treatment is available to children at Temple Street hospital for cystic fibrosis physiotherapy is when the child presents him- or herself to the accident and emergency unit following an attack or if his or her ailment is deteriorating significantly.  There is still no service available in the hospital for the 94 children who require this treatment.  I have written to the Minister again today because in his D\u00e1il reply and in the reply he gave here he stated that those children would be seen, but they are not being seen and their appointments are being cancelled.  I ask the Leader, through his good office, to raise this as a matter of urgency.  We all recognise the importance of looking after our children, particularly those with such a debilitating illness as cystic fibrosis.  We need urgency injected immediately into this matter.  I will seek further clarification from the Minister but if I am not getting responses, I intend to raise it continually.<\/p><p>On the so-called reforms of local government announced today by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, it is advisable that people get an opportunity to look at the report.<\/p> <p>It was only announced today, between 1 p.m. and 1.30 p.m.  I ask the Leader, well in advance of the legislation being published, to arrange for this House to debate in detail with the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government the findings and recommendations of the report.  I also ask that the debate be arranged for this week, given that our schedule is light.  There would be ample time on Thursday to debate these matters.  The abolition of town councils and town commissioners is not reform.  Reform of local government is needed.  This would be the right Chamber in which to debate the report well in advance of the legislation being published.  It appears that the report has been written as a sop to the Labour Party because it proposes an increase in the numbers of councillors in urban areas to offset potential losses the party might suffer in the 2014 local elections.  Leaving all that aside, an early debate on this issue is appropriate and I suggest it be held on Thursday.  We do not need to wait weeks to have the debate.  There will be statements on social welfare on Thursday, following which at 2.15 p.m. the House is due to rise.  The Fianna F\u00e1il group would be more than happy to sit late on Thursday to debate the issue of local government reform with the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600003#B00500","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350394500,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Like Senator Darragh O'Brien, I would like to have a debate on the Minister's plans for local government reform.  However, I refute entirely the Senator's suggestion that the report is a sop to the Labour Party.  This was agreed between the two coalition partners as part of the programme for Government.  Proper local government reform is long overdue to ensure the system will be more efficient and have greater powers of subsidiarity and decision-making at local level and that will be greater representation at local level.  I agree with the Senator that it is important that we debate the issue in the House.  While I am not sure it needs to be debated on Thursday, I would like to see such a debate taking place in the coming weeks.  We have a very important pre-budget debate on social welfare with the Minister for Social Protection arranged for Thursday.  The report requires very careful reading and it is important that we have an informed debate on it in the House.  <\/p><p>  There is more to the report than simply reducing the number of councils or merging town councils in municipal districts.  There are also some very important and radical measures proposed, for example, making arrangements to conduct business in a manner which would encourage greater participation by women in local politics.  I am delighted to see that proposal because I have raised in the House the need to ensure parliaments are run in a gender sensitive way.  This is part of an international movement.  It is also true that local authorities must be run in a gender sensitive way.  Another proposal envisages local authorities being funded through a new local property tax which would ensure local responsibility for decision-making and proper powers at local level.  As I said, reform is long overdue.  Some of the reforms have been mandated or are required in the light of the findings of the Mahon tribunal to ensure greater scrutiny and transparency in the planning process.  The report, therefore, deserves a detailed and thorough debate.  I agree that we should invite the Minister to come to the House in the coming weeks to engage with us before the legislation is produced.<\/p><p>  I welcome the report commissioned by the Department of Social Protection on food poverty, although I do not welcome its findings, as I do not think anyone in the House does.  However, it is very important that we are aware of the data covering the years 2009 and 2010 produced by <i>safe<\/i>food for the Department of Social Protection.  The report makes for very worrying reading because it highlights a 3% increase in the number of people living in food poverty in these years.  It finds that 10% of people were living in food poverty in 2010.  We have to try to ensure targeted interventions by the Department of Social Protection and others to tackle this issue and ensure the groups most at risk are provided for.  It is very useful that, at last, we have a proper, scientific measure of food poverty and the risk factors involved.<\/p><p>  There was some good news today about the young Pakistani schoolgirl, Malala Yousafzai, who is an icon in terms of the education of young girls and who was shot, tragically, by the Taliban last week.  She is making a good recovery in a hospital in England.  We celebrated International Day of the Girl last week, but the plight of Malala and her colleagues who are just trying to receive an education in their own country and encountering huge resistance from very conservative elements reminds us of the need to fight for gender equality in education across the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600004#C00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1350395100,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I support the call by Senator Darragh O'Brien for a debate on perinatal hospices.  We were all impressed by the families who addressed us prior to the summer break, but the core question is how to create a society that welcomes families with children who have been diagnosed with disabilities or foetal abnormalities which may be fatal in the short term, and provides the necessary legal and social support for parents and their babies.  It is important to revisit some of the themes that were opened up on the last occasion in order that we can learn the Government's plans, even in these straitened times, to ensure families in this situation receive the proper support.<\/p><p>The proposal last week to open a Marie Stopes clinic in Belfast caused concern for a significant number of people.  These events are, of course, taking place in a neighbouring jurisdiction but what happens there matters a great deal in terms of how these issues evolve in this jurisdiction.  We should welcome the warning from the Northern Ireland Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Edwin Poots, MLA, that the clinic must be careful to remain within the law.  I would go further to argue that Marie Stopes is an organisation that cannot be relied on to respect the law of the land.  It has no respect for human life, for mothers or for children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600005#D00200","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1350395100,"counter":13,"content":"<p>That is not true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600005#D00300","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1350395100,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I am surprised to hear Senator Bacik defend Marie Stopes, of all organisations.  Last year an Irish woman nearly died after a botched abortion by one of its doctors.  This doctor did not even have indemnity insurance.  He had been responsible for a death ten years earlier while he was working for the British pregnancy advisory service.  <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i> revealed how Marie Stopes appears to be abusing the law by its link with the organisation in Britain.  These are not the people to put in charge of caring for women's health.  What we see in the Northern situation is how an apparently narrow ground for abortion, namely, an alleged threat to life or health, gets used by people with an agenda.  In the Republic we have successfully guaranteed necessary medical treatment to women at all times without recourse to abortion by always guaranteeing a woman's life and health, even when it is not possible to save her child.  That approach of caring for two patients is the model we must follow and I hope it informs the Government's decisions and our debates in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  There is something inevitable about the proposal to cut the money going to fee-paying schools.  The Minister for Education and Skills has to find &#8364;77 million out of &#8364;9 billion.  It is understandable that fee-paying schools would be recognised as a legitimate target.  However, the Department of Education and Skills has asked for details on how the schools are spending their fee income and it may emerge that some of the schools are not in a position to sustain cuts because of the good commitments they have made.  I hope diversity will not be attacked, that Protestant schools in areas where they may be vulnerable will be exempted from any cuts and that serious consideration will be given to schools that cannot afford to sustain cuts.  In the end, these parents and families cost the State less when it comes to educating their children because they are putting in more.  That deserves credit rather than derision, and I hope the approach taken to the issue is not overly ideological.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600005#D00400","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1350395100,"counter":15,"content":"<p>As today is Michael Collins's birthday, we should remember one of the founding fathers of the State as a man who risked his life on numerous occasions before eventually giving his life for his country.

This is something for which I have been hoping and on which I have been working for a long time.  Following the granting of planning permission by the Northern Ireland Environment Minister last week, I am delighted the project can go ahead.  Provided funding under the INTERREG 4 scheme comes through, I hope the bridge will open in 2015.<\/p> <p>It is a great symbol, not only because Narrow Water was the site of where so many British soldiers were killed in one of the worst atrocities in the Troubles in the North, but because this project can be a step forward and the way towards unity of North and South.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600006#E03700","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350396000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I agree with what Senator Moran said about last Friday.

There were superb presentations by Geoffrey Shannon and Ian Elliott on the cross-Border dimension of child protection.  For lighter relief in the afternoon Brian Cassells and John Martin spoke about the restoration of the Ulster Canal as a tourism facility.  Great credit is due to everyone who ensured that part of the Good Friday Agreement was finally implemented.  Thanks are due to the Speaker, the Cathaoirleach and the secretariat.  It was a most important day.  One of the remarkable parts was that virtually everyone on the Unionist side claimed to be originally from places such as Monaghan or Donegal.

Ironically, however, there is no speaker listed who will represent distressed mortgage holders.  I heard the comments of Fiona Muldoon, director of credit institutions and insurance provision in the Central Bank, who was, to put it mildly, very critical of the role of the banks and their actions in dealing with distressed mortgages.  She described them - I paraphrase - as behaving like teenagers in their relationship with the Central Bank and the regulator.  She did not put too fine a tooth in it.<\/p><p>I realise this debate has been called for on a number of occasions but it is really high time we had the Minister for Finance in the Chamber to explain to us exactly what progress has been made in dealing with the situation of distressed mortgage holders.  The Central Bank gave some preliminary figures today which show that, particularly in the wider area of buy-to-let mortgages which has not really come into the public domain, the situation is deteriorating rapidly.  The bottom line is that the banking sector in this country, as Ms Muldoon, again, pointed out, has been kicking the can, waiting for some magic solution such as house prices beginning to rise once more, the level of employment rising dramatically by 20%, or whatever it may be.  All the while, every day of the week, there are distressed mortgage holders in this country who are in deeply disastrous situations.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to move the calling of that debate up the agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600008#G00400","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1350396600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I do not know how many Members were watching the RTE programme which followed the news last night.  It was about the issue of assisting people, some of whom were quite ill, to take their own lives.  There was an effort at balance by the inclusion of a person who was opposed to that concept.  However, like most RTE programmes on such social issues, there was an editorial agenda.  Certainly, judging from the presentation it was obvious where the programme makers stood in supporting that issue.  It troubled me, not only because of the actual issue but by the manner in which it was presented.  I kept asking myself about young people.  We have a tremendous problem in this country at present given the level of suicide.  One can think back on the number of times we have had debates in this House about people being killed in traffic accidents.  It was a significant issue and was often highlighted in this Chamber and in the Lower House.  As a consequence, efforts were made and the numbers of deaths have been reduced to about half the original number.  The number of suicides, however, is twice that of those killed annually on the roads.  This is a matter of great concern and has been raised here by other Members.<\/p><p>I have concerns about the manner in which these programmes are presented.  I am not an expert, not being a psychologist or psychiatrist.  However, I ask Members who are on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children to raise this issue and perhaps get some professional psychiatric advice in order to see what effect this type of programme that, so to speak, makes suicide look like a very reasonable decision for people to take, has on the minds of people who are troubled and who might find themselves taking that course because it has been presented as a reasonable option.<\/p><p>Will the Leader ask for a timely debate on the issue of suicide?  There are many people involved, including Deputy Dan Neville on the Government side who has done great work in this area.  I would like to acknowledge that, as I am sure would others.<\/p> <p>We should highlight the issue and ask the Minister to focus on it as many families have been devastated by the consequences of suicide.

A code of conduct on same is being established by the banking federations.  A problem with the code is that a statement of financial assessment consisting of 110 questions must be filled out.  One borrower with broadly similar circumstances to another could fill out the form but the result would be different.  One may be given the facility of interest-only or a break in his or her mortgage, whereas another could be forced to engage in a voluntary sale scenario.  Effectively, the banking sector is completely delinquent when it comes to dealing with these situations.  In my office I have met people with broadly similar financial circumstances who have been given completely different scenarios after undergoing stress tests and assessments that were conducted by a bank.  <\/p><p>If we want to get the banking sector right we need to wake up to its antics.

Why is Waterford being singled out for such treatment?  There is a perception in Waterford - I do not know whether it is just a perception or a reality - that its councils are being singled out.  The city must compete on an uneven playing field.  For example, the city does not have a university and there is high unemployment that is way above the national average.

The city has different needs from the county that require different responses to issues which are unique to different parts of the city.

This serious task should be conducted in a non-partisan way.  We need to tease out what the reform of local government entails - is it about economics, democracy or politics?  We do not sit on local authorities, but we must consider how these proposals affect the people on the ground.  There is a public perception of a creeping centralisation when it comes to the local democratic process and as a result accountability and responsibility suffers.  We know from personal experience that the power of local pride is unique.  We can see this at a time of achievement.  We can see it at a time of challenge and also in the time of need.  If we want to know how town councils are respected, we need only look at the turnout at election time, which is always exceptionally high.  One of the main reasons is the accountability at local level.<\/p><p>I sat on Cashel town council for 18 years.   I can remember the annual Estimates meeting.  People were waiting outside to ask councillors to account for the striking of the rate.  That is immediate accountability.  The greater the level of centralisation, the more one dilutes the local input.  <\/p> <p> Another aspect is its historical significance.  We have a charter in Cashel dating back several hundred years.  History tells us that the charter for the town council was given on the bridge of Golden by King William.  Whether we like King William is not the issue.  It is vital that the ceremonial nature of the councils and the heritage that goes with it are kept intact.  They will not be kept intact if this comes down to enlarging a county council and the removal of the local focus.  We should give great thought to the impact of this reform in the context of tourism.  We have seen time and again dignitaries coming to a town, meeting the mayor and the local council and getting a sense of stability and often an industry has been won for an area.  The same applies to tourism which I have no doubt is one of our most important industries.  The local council has been a vehicle for presenting it in the best fashion.  I, therefore, repeat my question: is this about economics?  Is it about democracy, or is it about politics?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600010#J00700","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350397800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I join my colleague, Senator Imelda Henry, in welcoming the good news we received in Sligo yesterday.

The Taoiseach and two Ministers were there yesterday, while the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, was in County Leitrim on Sunday to examine a number of very good projects, which is all very good news.  I call on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to meet public representatives in the Sligo-north Leitrim area regarding the provision of funding for the stretch of the N4 at Castlebaldwin.  While some work is being done, 29 people have lost their lives on it in recent years.  We must focus on this issue and make sure the road is realigned.  It is the last bad stretch between Sligo and Dublin and I call for funding to be made available for it.  It would also encourage the creation of more jobs in the region.  It is believed the condition of this stretch of road in terms of the difficulty presented in travelling into and out of the area is preventing people from approaching IDA Ireland and creating jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600011#K00200","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1350397800,"counter":98,"content":"<p>As my colleagues opposite congratulated Sligo Rovers, I had better strike a balance by congratulating Kenmare GAA Club on its victory in the county junior championship final.

Up until yesterday in Ireland there was one public representative per 2,600 people; in France there is one public representative for every 118 persons.  Our level of public representation will now be worse than that in our near neighbour, the United Kingdom, by some 2,000 people per public representative.

They caused significant damage to property in the theft of goods.  Apparently, the suspects are well known to the Garda.  They are using high speed vehicles and very difficult to apprehend because of our new road structure; therefore, Garda transport must be of a particularly high standard to ensure garda\u00ed are capable of pursuing these criminals.  I am aware that in the incident which occurred in east Galway a Garda vehicle packed it in during the course of the garda\u00ed's work.  It is welcome that 170 new vehicles will be made available.  The number of Garda stations is not as important as ensuring the Garda has the technology and transport required to pursue dangerous criminals who are causing devastation and instilling great fear in business people and ordinary people living in their homes.

Louth County Council, with its key partners in Newry and Mourne District Council, is anxious to build this bridge.  It will be a major tourism project for Newry and its hinterland, Cooley, Carlingford and the north Louth region, in particular, all of which will gain significantly from it.

I imagine that project will be welcomed on all sides.  <\/p><p>Senators Henry and Comiskey have commented on Stiefel Laboratories and the fact that the associated jobs will now be retained.  This is to be welcomed and I note the comments of both Senators in this regard.  <\/p><p>Senator Comiskey commented on the N4.  Perhaps the matter could be tabled by the Senator as an Adjournment matter and he could get an up-to-date report.<\/p><p>Senator Hayden and others, including Senators Noone and Conway, commented on the conference of the Irish Banking Federation and I note their points in this regard.  The issue of distressed mortgage holders is a serious matter and I imagine we will have many hours of debate on it when we deal with the Personal Insolvency Bill in the House.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Hayes, have dealt with the issue of mortgage arrears.  I agree with Senator Hayden that we should continue to receive updates on the matter as regularly as possible and I will try to arrange that.<\/p><p>Most of the other Senators dealt with the area of local government.  Senator Mullins remarked on the 170 new vehicles for the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  I imagine this will be welcomed by all.  It is of paramount importance to the force which has made strong representations to have the number of vehicles increased because of the poor quality of some in use.  The provision of the new vehicles will be welcomed by all and they will provide the Garda with the necessary resources to combat crime.<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke referred to the \u20ac440 million in savings with regard to drugs announced yesterday.  The new deal over the next three years will mean a significant reduction in the cost of drugs for patients, a reduction in the drugs bill for the State, greater access to new cutting edge drugs for certain conditions and an easing of financial pressure on the health service in future.  All of these will be welcomed by all Members and the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600015#O00300","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1350399600,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Bill 2012: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1350399900,"counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600016#P00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1350400200,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Dinny McGinley, to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600017#Q00100","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1350400200,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1350400200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>SECTION 3<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1350400200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, have been ruled out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600017#Q00350","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1350400200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>On a point of order, we were not notified of this in advance.

The prevalence of unsafe driving practices in this area has increased in recent years.  It has not been possible to curtail this behaviour because of jurisdictional issues along the stretch of road in question.  Members of Clones Town Council have tried various ways of stopping it, for example, through the council, the Oireachtas and the North-South Ministerial Council and by meeting representatives of the PSNI and the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  Nothing concrete has really happened yet to actually resolve the matter.  There is a serious concern that one of those who partake in these unsafe driving practices, or another user of the road, will lose his or her life or suffer a serious injury.  The practices to which I refer are taking place on the N54-A3 concession road.  While some of the joint operations of the Garda and the PSNI have acted as a deterrent, they have not brought about a lasting solution.  The road passes in and out of the North approximately five times, which makes it very difficult to police.<\/p><p>Representatives of the local community are concerned for the safety of those who travel on the road on a daily basis, including those who participate in these unsafe driving activities.  It is the main route that is used to transport patients to Cavan General Hospital.  In the past, the emergency services have been delayed on the road.  That could have serious consequences in the event of a rush on the ambulance service.  Many commuters use this road to travel to and from work.  The residents of the area go into lock-down, in effect, when practices like doughnutting are going on.  The road is taken over by the dangerous drivers and those who go to the area to view their activities.  As a result of the increase in social media and texting, these things can be organised at the drop of a hat.  Crowds form and disperse again.  The residents believe they are living in no-man's-land.  Nothing is being done to assist them.  This stretch of road will be the main route for tourists travelling to use the Ulster Canal when it is restored.  That project will have an effect on tourism in the area.<\/p><p>Some options have been considered as part of the effort to resolve the matter.  Both police forces - the PSNI and the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na - co-operated with a joint checkpoint operation at the location in question.  The use of CCTV, helicopter cameras, traffic calming measures or a new road surface has been considered.  It was felt that the most effective and long-lasting solution would be to extend the remit of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na to cover the entire local area.  That is why I have raised this issue with the Department of Justice and Equality.  Members of the Garda are frustrated because they are watching this activity going on ten yards away, but they are unable to do anything about it if it takes place outside the jurisdiction of the force.<\/p> <p>The PSNI has stated that this activity does not happen on a regular basis but this means it cannot plan for it or respond quickly.  These events can be organised quickly through social media and they are sporadic and difficult to monitor in that respect.  This activity is ongoing.  It is being perpetuated and it cannot be stopped because of the questions relating to the jurisdiction.  A road traffic accident occurred not too far up the road but the all the Garda could do was to alert oncoming traffic that there was an accident.  It was a long time before the PSNI was able to get on the scene.  This is why I am asking the Department about jurisdiction and what can be done to allow the Garda to go into these areas.  I realise this issue cuts across several Departments, including the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is relevant to the North-South Ministerial Council, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade previously answered questions on the matter.  I call for a response on the jurisdiction issue and I want to know what can be done.  The questions relating to jurisdiction are preventing the issue from being resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600029#CC00300","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350407100,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter on the Adjournment.  I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who regrets that he is unable to be present due to other business.  The Minister shares the Senator's concern about these incidents of anti-social driving behaviour and the impact they have on local communities.  On behalf of the Minister, I assure the Senator that the level of road traffic enforcement is high throughout the country and that effective roads policing is central to the Garda policing plan.  Enforcement activities are focused on the main causes of deaths and serious injury on the roads and members of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na use planned and unplanned checkpoints to detect breaches of a range of road traffic and transport legislation.  Effective roads policing has been a critical component in the success of the current road safety strategy and the substantial reduction we have seen in road traffic fatalities during recent years.  This emphasis in policing strategy will continue in future.<\/p><p>As far as the particular incidents described by the Senator are concerned, the Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that the activity referred to occurs, as the Senator pointed out, on a stretch of the N54 and A3 that traverses County Fermanagh.  Responsibility for road safety enforcement on that stretch of road rests with the PSNI.  On behalf of the Minister, I assure the House that An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na monitors traffic and performs static checkpoints at strategic locations on the portion of the road that is in the State.  The incidents in question are of great concern and, the Minister understands, can include occasions when traffic is stopped on the stretch of road and law-abiding motorists are prevented from proceeding while individuals perform dangerous driving manoeuvres before gatherings of spectators.<\/p><p>In light of the seriousness of these incidents and the particular geographical circumstances, there is close collaboration between An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the PSNI, with joint operations conducted to target these anti-social driving practices.  The Minister understands that there has been positive feedback with respect to these joint operations and their deterrent impact and that the Garda authorities and the PSNI have been proactive with regard to road safety enforcement measures in this area and its surrounds.  The Garda authorities have assured the Minister that these operations will continue to be prioritised in the future.  Further, the Minister assures the House that An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the PSNI maintain ongoing close liaison with local public representatives on both sides of the Border in respect of this matter, including local joint policing committees.<\/p><p>A delegation of local public representatives met the North-South Ministerial Council joint secretariat last year, but the Senator will appreciate that what is at issue is principally an operational policing matter and, accordingly, police co-operation on the ground is important.  The Minister has been assured that this is taking place.  Specifically, the Commissioner has assured the Minister that these joint operations to combat and disrupt the behaviour concerned will continue to be prioritised.  Naturally, I will share the Senator's concerns on the matter with the Minister as soon as I meet him.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, it is an issue of jurisdiction, but I am unsure whether that question is easily solved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600030#DD00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","time":1350407100,"counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600030#DD00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1350407100,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire St\u00e1it.<\/p> <p>T\u00e1 m\u00e9 thar a bheith bu\u00edoch di as teacht isteach agus t\u00e1 m\u00e9 an-s\u00e1sta gur ise at\u00e1 anseo chun an cheist seo a fhreagairt mar t\u00e1 a fhios agam go bhfuil an-suim aici san \u00e1bhar seo.

Probably the best way for me to highlight the issue is to tell the Minister of State of a case brought to my attention.  It involves a 92 year old woman in County Galway who is dependent on three carers in her home.  Unfortunately, she is not fully <i>compos mentis<\/i>.  She has a difficulty with memory loss.  She gets confused about what is happening around her and so on.  She is dependent on the three carers, two of whom are not with the HSE but the third is a HSE carer.  Her relatives tried to put in place a system such that they could keep track of whether she had been to the bathroom, whether she had had a bath, what tablets she had taken, etc.  They put in place a log book in the house such that each of the carers could make notes about what exactly had been done with the lady and what the position was when they were handing over.  This appears to be fine in the case of the two non-HSE carers but it has been an issue with the HSE carer.  It may simply be a blip in the system or it may be a HSE West scenario.<\/p><p> I have been told that this was brought to the attention of the HSE authorities.  Apparently, the superintendents in charge said that the only thing that the HSE carer was obliged to do was sign a timesheet indicating the time of arrival and departure and that the carer was under no obligation to fill in any log book or record detailing the medication given, whether the person had been to the bathroom, whether she had been washed, whether there had been any incidents during the day and so on.  The family are concerned because they are not in a position to be with the lady full time and they are dependent on what the carers say to them.  She is getting on in years and it is important that they know whether she is being fed and so on.<\/p><p> Is this is HSE policy nationally?  If so, can anything be done about it?  It seems to raise serious questions about the continuity of care in such a setting.  It is not necessarily anything to do with the cutbacks in the home care packages.  One imagines it is more a procedural issue.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State could provide clarification on the issue.  It is a personal issue and a serious one.  This incident and the personal situation may be the best way to highlight what we are trying to ascertain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600030#DD00400","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350407700,"counter":240,"content":"<p>This issue may become more prevalent as time goes on.  It provides me with an opportunity to update the House on the matter.  Government policy relating to older people is based on supporting people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  It is widely acknowledged that the home help service is one of the key services in community care.  The service is flexible, allowing it to be targeted at those in most need.  The service primarily includes the provision of personal care and essential domestic support, mainly for older people.  The level of service provided depends on resources available and is provided, depending on local arrangements, by HSE staff or through the use of private or voluntary organisations.<\/p><p>In 2011, there were 3,273,000 home help hours provided to approximately 13,550 clients in the HSE West region.  Some 2,300 clients were in receipt of a home care package at the end of 2011.  At the end of August 2012, approximately 2,140,000 home help hours were provided for clients in the HSE West region.  The number of people in receipt of home help services in the HSE West region at the end of August was 13,365.  The vast majority of clients in receipt of services were older persons.  I realise I am not answering any of the questions put by the Senator, but it is worth pointing out that the service is not only for older people but for people with disabilities and those with mental health issues.  Sometimes families experiencing social difficulties receive such support as well.<\/p><p>There is ongoing monitoring, mainly done through the public health nursing service and by the home help co-ordinators in each area.<\/p> <p>As part of the process of ensuring high standards of care, all home-help staff receive training in lifting and manual handling, health and safety, personal care and infection control.  All home helps undergo a Garda vetting process.<\/p><p>On indirectly provided services, all organisations are required to sign a service level agreement with the HSE setting out standards of service expected of providers as well as monitoring arrangements, staff training and Garda vetting.  The executive also provides, either directly or indirectly through voluntary or private organisations, home care packages.  A home care package provides an enhanced level of community services and supports above the normal levels available from mainstream community services.  These packages do not replace existing services.  At end-August in HSE West, approximately 2,370 persons were in receipt of a home care package.<\/p><p>Following a national procurement process concluded earlier this year, approved external providers of home care packages must meet certain criteria, including requirements on quality, safety and monitoring.  This procurement process is part of continuing efforts by the HSE to improve its standards overall for home care.  The Government is committed to developing and implementing national standards for home support services, which will be subject to inspection by the Health Information and Quality Authority.  Primary legislation and resources will be required for the introduction of a statutory regulation system for home care services.  The question of possible changes to legislation, including regulation and inspection, for home care services for older persons is under consideration in the context of the need to prioritise legislation for the areas of children and disability.  I trust the House will agree that we need to ensure that the highest standard of care will continue to be provided to all in a safe and secure environment.  Providing quality and safe care will always remain at the heart of any service provision.<\/p><p>I am not certain that any of that answers the Senator's question but I have taken a note of the matter.  He can understand that I would not have that level of detail and it is not right that I should have that level of details.  Sometimes to have that sort of detail floating around may not be good.  However, I will inquire and find out.  Clearly, being able to have that handover is important.  As he stated, whether there was an incident, whether the person has a cold or a temperature, or whether the person's behaviour has changed, is vitally important in terms of the person's ability to continue living in his or her own community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101600031#EE00200","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350408300,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I appreciate the answer.  I appreciate that perhaps I was not specific enough in the question on monitoring but the Minister of State will appreciate that it is the handover and the monitoring between carers even on a daily basis that we were looking at.  I appreciate that the Minister of State will come back to me on it.  I note that she spoke about implementing national standards for home support services.  The suggestion might be that, when that is being looked at on a daily routine basis, part of those national standards for home support include that if there is a change in the person who is giving the care, be that because of a change of shift or whatever, part of the handover includes the handing over of notes.  Apparently, it was not a one-off.  The person who brought this to my attention is a reasonable person and it was happening on a continual basis, and only with a HSE employee in that scenario.  If there are guidelines in place, they might need to be looked at before something serious happens.

We had a choice and had to prioritise.  Clearly, with all the different reports, children had to come first, and then disability services in an institutional setting.  The third on that list are the home-based services, not only for older persons.  When HIQA sits down to put in place the compliance standards that will be necessary in order to get a licence from it, we will see all of that and those matters will be brought to HIQA's attention.<\/p><p>HIQA recently completed the standards on disabilities and it will be commencing those inspections on 1 July next.
