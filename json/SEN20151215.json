One has only got to look at the images coming out of Athlone and further down river, and in south Galway, at the devastation that has been caused.  The IFA yesterday indicated that a further 10,000 acres of farmland have now been flooded.  It is past time that the Government took remedial action.  The multi-agency approach should be abandoned immediately.  My party would propose that there would be one co-ordinating agency set up, similar to what has happened in Holland where they got rid of all the agencies involved with their flooding problems, and that the Taoiseach should chair that co-ordinating body as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p>I, therefore, am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, come before the House to outline exactly the Government's proposals.  The message, whatever it is in Government Buildings, is not getting through to the general population and it certainly is not getting through to the business people and residents of Leitrim village, Carrick-on-Shannon, Athlone and all down along the river as a result of what is happening with the ESB and the weir at Parteen.  All of this is affecting the entire country - this is not a sectional issue - and in any other country, it would be deemed a national crisis.  It is heartbreaking to see the interviews with residents in the most beautiful of homes and the water damage that is being done that will probably result in the houses never being restored to their former glory.<\/p> <p>I want to get some indication from the Leader as to when the Minister for Justice and Equality will come before the House because it would afford an opportunity to highlight the dramatic increase in crime in Dublin, coupled with the Government's policy of slashing Garda numbers which has resulted in many living in fear in their own homes, in businesses under continuous threat of theft and anti-social behaviour on the streets.  The most recent crime statistics show burglaries in Dublin were up almost 15%, year-on-year, rape and sexual assaults up 15.4% and public order offences up 8.4%.<\/p> <p>We, on this side of the House, would submit that this cannot continue.  In fact, Dublin has almost 700 fewer garda&iacute; this year compared to 2010.  Fianna F&aacute;il will reverse this unimaginative and dangerous policy of the Government over the past five years.  We will not only restore the totality of the Garda force to 14,000 but also establish a dedicated Garda public order unit for the city centre to combat drug dealing and anti-social behaviour on the capital's main commercial streets.  When will there be an opportunity for us to outline these policies in more detail in the House before the Minister for Justice and Equality?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#P00100","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We have had the Minister for Justice and Equality in this House on a wide variety of legislation in the past few weeks, and this week is no exception.

I welcome also the jobs announcements - an issue we often overlook - of recent days.  Hundreds of jobs have been announced this morning and yesterday morning.  <br\/><br\/>I welcome the news that at today's Cabinet meeting a change was agreed to the current marriage exemption for children under the age of 18.  This change has been agreed on foot of a motion raised in this House by me, on behalf of Labour Party Senators, proposing the motion, and seconded by Senator Jillian van Turnhout who had also raised the issue.  We had tabled this motion because of concerns arising that a large number of exemptions were being granted to the general rule that children cannot enter marriages in Ireland.  We asked the Minister on 25 June 2014 to look at sections 31 and 33 of the Family Law Act 1995 with a view to ending the practice of allowing exemptions from the rule that parties to a marriage must be over the age of 18 years.  On that date we set out our serious concerns about the possibility of coercion or of children being forced into marriage at a young age.  We noted that approximately 30 weddings had been contracted in Ireland in 2012 where either or both parties were under the age of 18 years.<br\/><br\/>Quite a number of exemptions are being granted in the High Court.  These applications are carried out <i>in camera<\/i>.  We do not have any data on who is applying or the context of the applications but we did refer to a High Court judgment from 2013 where Mr. Justice McMenamin had referred, with concern, to the practice of young people being coerced in some way into marriage contracts.  I am delighted the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, who, on foot of our motion, set up an interdepartmental working group, has brought before the Cabinet a proposal to end the practice.  It is a good day for the Seanad to see a change in policy as a result of a motion tabled in this House.  I commend Labour Women who first raised this as an issue with me and, Senator Jillian van Turnhout, who had also raised the issue.  It is an important child protection issue and a good step forward for children's rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#P01300","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>On my way to work this morning I passed Firhouse, an area of Tallaght, and I thought that is where Ibrahim Halawa should be still celebrating his 20th birthday with his family.

He lacks medical treatment.  Letters from him describe regular beatings, being stripped naked in front of inmates and guards and being hit with metal chains.

After last weekend, we know that no single body is responsible for the Shannon.  A Shannon river basin authority is necessary.

In New Zealand, which is the top ranked country in terms of the ease of starting a business, it takes just one procedure and half a day, and costs less than &euro;100.  We can do this, but we need to set our minds to it and determine what to do.  The job creation of recent years has been successful, but this needs a determined effort.  One approach would be to encourage entrepreneurship and make it easier to start a new business.

The moment the green hammer came down - I think it was at 6.07 p.m. - to say that 196 of the world's nations had reached an agreement on how to regulate climate change was incredible.  It has been hailed as one of the greatest diplomatic successes of this century and, indeed, the last, particularly after the Copenhagen talks collapsed in bitterness and disarray.  At the end of the day, the answer to what we are seeing in terms of the Shannon and all the other issues, such as flooding, rising sea levels, heatwaves and so forth, lies in international co-operation.<\/p> <p>I would also like to raise two points about what is happening, particularly in the Shannon.  It is appalling to see people's homes and their lands being flooded.  I took the train back from Galway the weekend before last and the level of flooding was unbelievable.  It was shocking.  There are impacts on people's farmland and animals as well, not just on people's homes.  The first issue is that for too long we have allowed people to build on floodplains, and that is clearly something that has to stop.  Second, even where successive governments have taken measures to tackle flooding, in the Dargle area in Dublin, for example, people in those homes still cannot get insurance.  There is no obligation on insurance companies to take into account any of the flood defence mechanisms that have been put in place.  I have done some investigation into this with Dublin City Council, which confirmed what I had been told by residents: they cannot get insurance, despite the fact that millions of State money has been spent on putting in place very effective flood defences.<\/p> <p>There is a need to have some type of State-backed insurance policy for people who have been the victims of flooding.  This is the situation in many other countries, but in Ireland, the insurance industry is purely commercial.  The bottom line is that people whose homes have been flooded even once have a duty to declare it and may never get insured.  That is an appalling situation, and one that needs to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#S00100","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I call for a debate on health care.  The Leader arranged for a debate a few weeks ago.  Unfortunately, that was only 45 minutes long and it was not sufficient to critique the Government's failed health service plan and policies.  Even top officials in the HSE over the weekend were talking about a lack of vision, a lack of resources and a lack of capacity.  We saw from the now-averted nurses' strike that we have very real problems on the front line in our health service.  None of that happened by accident.  It happened through five budgets supported by all the Members on the Government benches who took money and capacity out of our health services.  Our hospitals, primary care, mental health services and supports for people with disabilities were all stripped of resources and hacked away at over the past five years.<\/p> <p>Today, Sinn F&eacute;in launched its Better for Health policy document, which is the first time any party has set out a costed plan for universal healthcare.  Obviously during the course of the election campaign, we will go toe-to-toe with the Government parties and others on that.  The Government has now abandoned its policy of universal health insurance, and very senior officials in the HSE are now saying what many of us in the Opposition had been saying for a long time, namely, that the Government and the country is rudderless when it comes to health care and that there is no leadership coming from the Government, the Minister or the Department.  It is very serious and is having an impact on patient care.  The crisis has driven up waiting times in many specialties, including in Waterford, the Leader's own area, where key services, such as opthalmology, ENT and others, are at crisis point.

Sinn F&eacute;in has made out that consultants are being paid too much.  We have a big challenge in this country with the recruitment of medical staff.  One of the challenges we are going to have to face over the next four or five years is the appropriate remuneration for people who have worked to get to the grade they are in and who can provide the expertise that is required in areas like orthopaedics and ear, nose and throat.  The whole transplant area is of particular concern.  Approximately 150 kidney transplants are done in this country each year, whereas more than 300 such procedures are done annually in Norway, which has a similar population.  The reason for this discrepancy is that we cannot get the consultants we require to provide the service we want to provide.<\/p> <p>I want to speak about last week's incident when two Members of the Oireachtas were conveyed to Limerick Prison to avoid having to pay fines.  It is important to outline for the public that the attachment of earnings legislation comes into place on 11 January next.  The day when those who fail to pay the fines imposed on them for committing crimes are carted off to prison will be behind us from that date because the courts will have the power to make an order to have the payment come from the earnings of such people.  This is a welcome development, particularly at a time when over 50% of those admitted to our prisons are admitted for non-payment of fines.  Approximately 89,000 warrants are with the Garda to be executed for non-payment of fines.  We should have implemented this significant change a long time ago.  I am delighted this measure is coming into place on 11 January next.  Members of the Oireachtas who want to break the law from now on have to realise that the fines imposed on them will be taken from their earnings.  This will prevent the time of the Garda, the Prison Service and the Courts Service from being wasted as it was last week.  It is a welcome development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#T00800","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#T00900","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>We will see it put in place on 11 January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#T01000","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I second the proposal on the Order of Business that has been made by Senator Mooney.<\/p> <p>I do not think the Minister for Health is doing his job.  He has been a complete failure since he was appointed.  I know he was put in there to bury his political ambition to become the leader of Fine Gael.  The Taoiseach's decision to appoint him to the Department for Health has been very successful from that perspective because he has proven to be a complete and utter disaster in that role.  This was evident once again last night when it was decided to postpone elective surgery that was due to take place today.  People were waiting and ready to have their operations, but they were all cancelled because the HSE and the Minister would not make an agreement with Liam Doran and the nurses.  They subsequently got a great deal, and now there are claims coming in.  I heard Mr. Bell of SIPTU on the radio today saying that the ambulance drivers, attendants, doctors and everyone else he represents who is involved in accident and emergency all want whatever the nurses are getting.<\/p> <p>I will put this into context.  The former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and the Taoiseach closed the accident and emergency unit at Roscommon acute general hospital.  If that unit were available now - it was very successful when it was open - it would take pressure off Galway.  Its closure is one of the greatest failures of the Government.  The people of County Roscommon were lied to and betrayed by those who gave a commitment prior to the 2011 general election.  The commitment in question resulted in the election of two Fine Gael Deputies in the Roscommon-South Leitrim constituency.  Given the chaos that will ensue in the future in the whole hospital system, the Minister would be better engaged going to the accident and emergency department at University Hospital Galway and other such departments throughout the country to study what is happening on the ground and to see how things can be improved.  There is no reason a patient who needs attention and immediate treatment cannot be brought directly to a bed in a hospital if a doctor feels that person should qualify.  That is happening without going through the accident and emergency process in some hospitals where there is a relationship between the consultants and the general practitioners.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Terry Leyden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=636\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is an old system which needs to be changed but the Minister will certainly not change anything.

However, it is not the only area in which the Government is in serious dereliction of its duty.  Last Thursday, the Master of the High Court highlighted an area where the failure to address the concerns of people who are finding themselves before the courts, brought there by the banks, is a scandal.  The Master did the State some service by highlighting the case of a person whose house could have been sold for &euro;90,000 but was subsequently sold off as part of a bulk lot to an equity fund.  It transpires that only approximately &euro;60,000 was obtained and the person is responsible for the difference.  Therefore, the failure of the State to address this is adding to the crises people are experiencing.  It is indicative of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act under which a veto was given to the banks and the bankruptcy legislation in respect of which the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, spent two to three years vacillating before introducing an inadequate Act which we argued against in the House.

This is the tenth time his court case has been postponed.  Some 493 other people are on trial with him at the same time.  It is a mass trial.  He has been held in captivity for over 852 days and has not been afforded a fair trial.  The concern is about the Irish Government's activities, or lack thereof.  As I have said many times before, Egyptian law 140 allows for a prisoner to be repatriated to his home country before a trial.  Although the Government and Minister said it could not be done, they silently supported a law 140 application in February.  They forgot to tell anybody about it.  During the summer, they repeatedly said they could not enforce law 140 or ask the Egyptian President to invoke it until after a trial.  Now, they have admitted it could be done but have said it would not be the best possible course of action.  Given the trend of what the Government has said about the case during the past 12 months, it is shocking that it has been inconsistent.<\/p> <p>The Minister was here last week.  The fact that the case is to be heard next Saturday is a cause of concern.  There is grave concern that a death sentence could be passed, as has happened in other cases.  The Government seems unaware that, unlike in the case of Peter Greste, an Australian national whose release was secured by the Australian Prime Minister before his trial, if Ibrahim Halawa is found guilty and sentenced to death, law 140 may not be applicable, given that it applies only in cases in which the sentence can be carried out in the jurisdiction to which a person is repatriated.  The Government does not seem to be concerned about it or aware of it.  Ibrahim Halawa has been tortured and kept in detention for a long time.  Last Sunday was his 20th birthday and he has been in jail since he was 17.  The myriad UN declarations and conventions the Egyptian Government has breached is astonishing.

However, we need to get the message out that towns and villages are open for business.  Unfortunately, many people stayed away from shops in towns over the weekend because of a perception that every place was flooded.  Traders throughout the country want to get the message out that, in the main, businesses are open.<\/p><p>There is a lot of work to be done when the floods have receded and we need the 300 schemes in line for funding under the CFRAM programme to be expedited.  As Senator Hayden said, we also need to have a discussion on flood insurance.  It is an absolute shame that, where major moneys have been expended and good defences put in place, insurance companies have not recognised it.  I was pleased that the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, spoke extensively about this over the weekend and I welcome his determination to address this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#W00700","speaker":"1118","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Senator Mooney said the multi-agency approach to flooding had not worked and should be abandoned in favour of a single agency approach.

The Bill serves two primary purposes.  First, it is necessary to authorise in law all the expenditure that has been undertaken in 2015 on the basis of the Estimates that already have been agreed during the year.  The amounts included in section 1 and Schedule 1 to be appropriated for supply services all relate to amounts included in the Estimates set out in the Revised Estimates Volume 2015 of &euro;41.7 billion in aggregate, as well as the Supplementary Estimates of &euro;1.4 billion.  Second, the passage of the Appropriation Bill 2015 is essential to provide a legal basis for all existing voted expenditure to continue into 2016 in the period before the D&aacute;il votes on the 2016 Estimates.<\/p> <p>Under the rolling multi-annual capital envelopes introduced in budget 2004, Departments may carry over from the current year to the following year unspent capital up to a maximum of 10% of voted capital.  The multi-annual system is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the management by Departments and agencies of capital programmes and projects.  It recognises the difficulties inherent in the planning and profiling of capital expenditure and acknowledges that capital projects may be subject to delay.  The carryover facility allows for a portion of unspent moneys, which would have been lost to the capital programmes and projects concerned under the annual system of allocating capital, to be made available for spending on programme priorities in the subsequent year.  The Appropriation Act determines definitively the capital amounts that may be carried over to the following year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The aggregate amount of proposed capital carryover is just under &euro;112 million, which represents less than 3% of the total capital programme of &euro;3.8 billion.  The proposed amounts to be carried over by Vote are set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill.  The 2016 Revised Estimates volume, to be published in the coming days, will set out detailed financial and key performance information for Departments and offices.  In Part II of the Estimates, for each Vote availing of the capital carryover facility, a table will be included listing the amounts to be deferred by subhead.<\/p><p>The first payroll payments of 2016 are to be paid to staff and pensioners on 1 and 4 January 2016.  Departments and offices must have the funds for these payments in their commercial bank accounts before the end of this year to ensure that staff and pensioners have access to their money by the due dates.  In addition, An Post makes certain payments on an agency basis on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  To disburse payments to social welfare recipients in the first week of January 2016, An Post needs to be pre-funded before the end of 2015 to be in a position to convert electronic fund transfer payments from the Department of Social Protection into real cash and physically transfer it to its network of post offices throughout the country.  These Exchequer pay and pension and social welfare payments will form part of the supply services for 2016 and, consequently, the funds to cover these costs will be included in amounts disbursed from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General's supply account as part of the 2016 supply issues and will come under moneys voted by the D&aacute;il in 2016, in respect of which the usual processes and mechanisms for voted moneys in 2016 will apply.  However, as the funds need to be available in the Paymaster General's supply account before the end of the year to facilitate timely payment, section 3 of the Appropriation Bill includes a specific provision to allow for an advance from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General's supply account of the appropriate amounts of money.  Any amounts advanced to the supply account will be repaid to the Central Fund in January.<\/p><p>The signed Act is required by the Comptroller and Auditor General for clearance of the end-of-year issues from the Exchequer.  Under Article 25.2.1&deg; of the Constitution, the President may not sign a Bill earlier than the fifth day after the date upon which the Bill is presented to him.  However, there is provision in Article 25.2.2&deg; whereby, at the request of the Government and with the prior concurrence of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the President may sign a Bill on an earlier date.  In view of the urgency of this Bill, the provision in Article 25.2.2&deg; is sought and a motion to this effect is placed before the Seanad.  Such an earlier signature motion has been sought in relation to the Appropriation Bill in previous years.<\/p><p>I remarked at the outset that the Appropriation Bill is an essential element of housekeeping which those of us in both Houses of the Oireachtas are required to undertake.  The passing of the Bill will authorise in law all of the expenditure that has been undertaken in 2015 on the basis of the Estimates debate and voted on by the D&aacute;il during the year.  Of fundamental importance to those who depend on our essential public services, and to those on public sector pay, pensions and social welfare payments, the passage of the Appropriation Bill will allow the payments required to deliver these public services to continue into 2016 in the period before the D&aacute;il approves the 2016 Estimates.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#CC00600","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I compliment him on doing a fine job.  Every time we have emergency situations he is certainly doing a good job.  The big debates in this House over recent months were on issues such as health, law and order, legislation on burglaries, home care for the elderly and child care.  Those are the big issues.  We all appreciate that the books must be balanced, and it is very easy to get up on a soapbox and make a speech, but I do not think that is what it is about.  However, there are areas that need to be examined as priorities.  We did not expect the recent terrible flooding.  I do not know how people are able to put up with that, and some of the stories are heartbreaking.  Some of these people have been hit repeatedly and flooded on two or three occasions.  Whatever is decided financially for the future, we have to deal with the flooding as an emergency in the same way that any other country would.  I was very impressed to see the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, lay aside the European rules during the UK's flooding events and order the rivers to be dredged.  I know there is a fisheries element there which needs to be looked at.  Compensation has to be realistic, because even though money has to be found quickly, &euro;5,000 or any money like that is not going to be sufficient to repair the affected properties.<\/p> <p>Regarding An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I do not think there is any value in asking who closed this station or who closed that station.  Burglary is a big issue at the moment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1968\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1968&amp;amp;pid=LabhrasOMurchu&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is not an exaggeration to state that people are petrified in their homes.  We all agree with Mr. Justice Hardiman that, apart from the theft of property involved, breaking into a person's home is an act of aggression.  Having listened to all the arguments, I believe garda&iacute; are still needed at local level.  Neighbourhood Watch and so forth should also be funded.<\/p><p>On the issue of health, which was raised by several Senators, no right-thinking person would agree to allow someone to lie on a trolley for an excessive period.  However, when we see a person of 80 or 90 years on a trolley it strikes at the heart of our compassion.  I am not sure money is always the reason.  There are vested interests in the health service and everyone involved in the system must be prepared to co-operate.  If money is needed to ensure people are given proper care and maintain their dignity, it must be provided.<\/p><p>There is much to be said for providing assistance to allow elderly people to remain in their homes.  I have never met an elderly person who wanted to move into a nursing home because this is invariably viewed as marking the end of their lives.  There are some wonderful nursing homes and Senators will have seen how well they look after elderly people.  If an elderly person can remain at home with a degree of independence, we must ensure resources are provided to support him or her to do so.  The elderly have worked and paid taxes throughout their lives and their loved ones would like them to remain at home.  Many supports, including in the area of security, are available to them.  We should help elderly people who wish to remain at home and live mobile, independent lives.<\/p><p>The issue of children has been discussed in the Chamber on many occasions.  Children are the most vulnerable group in society and we must help parents, whether they are single or married, in whatever way possible.  All Senators will have heard stories about giving with one hand and taking away with the other.  If we are genuinely concerned about the welfare of children and the opportunities afforded to them in life, we must provide them with assistance and support.<\/p><p>All of these issues form part of the budgetary process and it is not easy to prioritise one issue over another.  The least well-off and most vulnerable must be given priority at all times.  It is interesting that these are the people who very often do not have a voice.  The well-off - I am not being anti-capitalist in this matter - are generally well able to make a case for themselves and often do well in budgets.  We have to give the most vulnerable hope and show them that we respect them and want them to retain their dignity.  We must also ensure they are always given priority when finances are being distributed.  Has this been done?  A significant degree of poverty persists.  One need only consider the number of meals and other assistance provided to the poor.  Many people are still going to bed hungry, while others cannot afford to heat their homes.  Unfortunately, because we do not experience poverty ourselves, it often remains below the radar.  The House should discuss the reality on the ground in a non-partisan manner.  I would hate to have people trying to win votes out of people's problems and difficulties.<\/p><p>Some people are too proud to admit that they do not have a single euro to spend.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1968\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1968&amp;amp;pid=LabhrasOMurchu&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One may blame the economy or world situation, but Ireland is a country that has been so good when people in other countries needed help.

I would not say anything about pushing up tax a little if it would help those people because we cannot feel good ourselves - it is not good for our morale - when we see this is happening and we are unable to do anything.  At the end of the day, it is only the legislators who can do this.  We should be discussing specifics but we cannot really go into specifics at this time.  However, I hope that any time we have funding to dispense we will always keep the vulnerable in society at the top of our priority list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#DD00200","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.<\/p> <p>Effectively, the Appropriation Bill is an accounting exercise to balance the books and ensure that there is capital in place for issues or emergencies that may arise.

It was valuable for the Minister of State to be with people and hear from the shopkeepers themselves.  We saw him on television going in and accumulating all of that information.<\/p> <p>There are some interesting points in the Appropriation Bill.  The Minister of State stated that the Supplementary Estimates of &euro;1.4 billion is about 3.3% of the &euro;41.7 billion that the Minister was spending.  In the older days of the public finances, Supplementary Estimates were looked upon askance and regarded as something one should not do.  I suppose we might get worried if it went much over 3.3%, but, in general, we learned the hard way how to run the public finances in Ireland.  We do not wish to unlearn those lessons so there is a serious onus on those seeking Supplementary Estimates to justify what they entail.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State mentioned that the carryover on capital projects is 3% of the value of those projects.  That is a margin, but I suppose the danger would be if the Departments doing the spending begin to regard it as theirs and do not return to the Department of Finance.  One must keep an eye on that aspect.<\/p> <p>I welcome initiatives such as the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service which will put the evaluation of capital projects on an independent and sound basis as distinct from merely advocating projects and providing crude figures, such as that investment as a percentage of GDP is lower than it used to be.  It is the case that GDP is lower than it used to be in the period when the public finances were getting into trouble but one must have sound prudent management of the public finances and proper appraisals of the projects involved.  I would prefer those to be done independently and published well in advance so that they can be discussed in the Houses of the Oireachtas and elsewhere.<\/p> <p>That brings me to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the value-for-money officer under the Constitution.  That is a valuable post in seeking to keep the finances in order so that we do not get back into the troubles and problems of the past.  The Comptroller and Auditor General deals with a &euro;6.6 million budget and &euro;5.9 million in appropriations-in-aid out of a &euro;43.1 billion supply grant and the &euro;3.1 billion carryover.  It is an important post and I often think the Comptroller and Auditor General should be involved more.  Sometimes he waits until what we need is the State Pathologist.  Perhaps he should intervene earlier to state projects are going off the rail.  The Comptroller and Auditor General did intervene, I think, with the agreement of all members of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communication, on the issue of the seven-digit non-sequential postal addresses.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sean D.

I appreciate that the Bill before us is different and I am not criticising what is being done here today.  In general, however, there should be an amber light in the context of pushing the President to sign legislation before he or she has had a good chance to read it and, perhaps, to either point out some things which the Oireachtas might need to consider or refer it to the Council of State or the courts.<\/p><p>The current Oireachtas is nearing the end of its lifetime.

I do not think there is any harm in giving us a couple of minutes to debate this Bill.  While the Seanad is limited in terms of its domain over financial matters, there is nothing wrong with taking a look occasionally at some of the financial issues that come before Government.  I agree with my colleague that the Bill is technical in nature.  I would make two observations.  One relates to the aggregate amount of the capital carryover which as the Minister of State said is &euro;112 million, which represents less than 3% of the total capital programme of &euro;3.8 billion.  That is an incredibly low amount of money to carry over.  Coming up to the end of the year, I hope Departments do not spend their time trying to hasten across the line certain projects, particularly as the limiting factor of time would have the potential to impact on cost.  A  larger amount of capital carryover would be more reflective of the realities relating to capital projects.  In the context of overall Government expenditure in the region of &euro;43 billion - including the &euro;1.4 billion - we still have an incredibly small capital programme.  I am aware we will be addressing that in the coming years but it is important to reflect on where we have come from in terms of the difficulties in repairing the country's economy and finances.  We need to acknowledge that, from a capital perspective, we have taken a very significant hit in recent years in terms of the capital programme.  As a Government, we have taken steps to address that but it will have to be a priority for this or any future Government in the years to come.<\/p> <p>In the context of the purpose of the Bill, it is obviously a sensible measure designed to allow for a carryover into the early week of the new year, from 1 to 4 January 2016.  I wonder whether our accounting measures could be adjusted in order that we are not obliged to put in place an Appropriation Bill to cover such a short period and having to go through the earlier signature motion and so forth.  We have managed to change the tax date from, I think, 5 April back to 31 December and then to 31 October.  Surely there must be a way of changing the way we set out appropriations where it is possible to have a residual sum carried over into the following year without the need to enact specific legislation on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#GG00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>As there are no other contributors, I call on the Minister of State to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#GG00300","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I thank all Senators for their constructive contributions to what is a technical item of legislation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->To pick up where Senator Hayden left off, I agree that it is worth giving time to scrutinise this legislation because that would be a useful overview of where we find ourselves in terms of the public finances.  Undoubtedly, the economic crisis had a profound impact on those finances.  When the Government was elected, the budget deficit stood at 12.5% of GDP.  This year, it is on track to be below 2%.  General Government debt has reduced from a peak of 120% of GDP and is forecasted to decline to close to 90% in 2016.  That is still much too high, but is back in the realm of the European average and is something that we can reduce further in the coming years.<\/p><p>Sustainable public finances are required if the Government is to provide the necessary infrastructure to encourage economic growth and job creation and deliver essential public services to our citizens.  The fiscal adjustment implemented in order to exit the EU-IMF programme of support successfully and return sustainability to the public finances required significant tax increases and expenditure reductions.  Gross voted expenditure was reduced from its peak of just over &euro;63 billion in 2009 to &euro;54 billion in 2014.  In implementing expenditure reductions, the Government's priority was to ensure that a targeted approach was adopted in order to protect key public services and social supports to the greatest extent possible at a time of increasing demand.  It is fair to say that budget 2015 marked a turning point in our recovery, when expenditure reductions were no longer required to meet our fiscal targets and we were in a position to provide targeted increases for front-line services.<\/p><p>Against a background of Exchequer tax receipts being almost &euro;3 billion ahead of profile this year, additional funding has been made available through Supplementary Estimates of &euro;1.4 billion to support key services and social supports.  While the bulk of the additional revenue has gone to pay down debt, the key sectors of health, social protection and education have been prioritised.  These are issues of importance to Senators on all sides of the House and account for more than 80% of gross current expenditure.  The Government has protected core social welfare rates and, under budget 2016, the State pension will be increased by &euro;3 per week.  Though small, this is the first increase in the State pension since 2009.  Our commitment to protecting society's most vulnerable is found in data published by EUROSTAT this year, which showed that Ireland's system of social transfers - the redistribution of wealth and income to those most in need - is among the most effective in Europe at reducing the risk of poverty.<\/p><p>Aside from social transfers, the Government's fundamental reforms to labour market activation represent a significant modernisation of Ireland's tackling of unemployment through a two-pronged approach.  Pathways to Work ensures that the unemployed are given a chance to upskill and rejoin the workforce while the Action Plan for Jobs has directed its efforts towards boosting labour demand through key reforms.  Unemployment has decreased from a peak of over 15% to below 9%.  While that remains too high, it is moving in the right direction towards full employment, which must be our collective relentless pursuit.  I am not just referring to headline full employment, but real full employment, in which we tackle issues like long-term unemployment and people with disabilities wanting to access the workforce but not being afforded the supports to do so.  I challenge the next Oireachtas to do that.<\/p><p>One of the Government's first acts was to reverse the cut to the minimum wage.  From January, the new statutory minimum wage will rise to &euro;9.15 per hour.  Our investment in the health sector has ensured that key front-line services have been maintained and will be enhanced further through initiatives such as extending free general practitioner, GP, care to children under six years of age, which is due to be extended next year to children under 12 years of age.  The additional funding provided to health this year has allowed staffing levels within the sector to be increased by more than 3,700 in the first ten months of 2015, with this increase primarily and rightly concentrated in our hospitals.  The amount to be allocated to health next year will bring funding back to pre-crisis levels, but I take Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s point that it is not all about funding and must be about continuing to reform.  I welcome the initiative taken by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, today in deferring industrial action and considering a number of the proposals that it discussed at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, last night to address the important issues being experienced by front-line nurses in accident and emergency services on a daily basis.<\/p><p>Since the beginning of 2012, we have invested more than &euro;1.25 billion in school buildings, sought to protect DEIS expenditure, which prioritises the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged areas, protected the pupil-teacher ratio and, in budget 2016, reduced the ratio from 28:1 to 27:1 at primary level and from 19:1 to 18.7:1 at second level.  The allocation set out in next year's budget will provide for more than 2,260 new teaching posts, including 600 resource teachers.  The expansion of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme announced in budget 2016 will provide a second free preschool year to 75,000 children and support children with special needs in accessing those preschool years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The social housing strategy aims to deliver 3,100 social housing units in 2016, with 3,000 units to be delivered in 2015.  An additional 10,000 households will receive housing assistance payment in 2016.<br\/><br\/>I want to return to the issue raised by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; regarding the recent flooding.  This issue is very close to my heart and to my ministerial responsibilities.  The recent flooding has clearly highlighted the need for the Government to do exactly what it wants to do, which is to increase significantly our investment in flood risk management in this country.  We cannot get away from the fact that we are seeing more and more severe weather events and we are likely to continue to see that.  We are all aware of the consequences of climate change.  Through our capital plan, we intend to spend more on flood relief in the next five years - &euro;430 million - than has been spent in the last 20 years.  That cannot be lost on people.  While I very much welcome the generous remarks of Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, it is important that people do not play politics with this.  People have gone through a very difficult few weeks.  We have had a national weather crisis.  We have seen over a month's worth of rainfall in 24 hours in parts of this country.<br\/><br\/>Yesterday, I met with the people in Bandon and Skibbereen.  I met with people whose shops had been flooded again.  This is a situation we all have to resolve, but we must also be honest with people.  Major flood relief schemes take about five years to deliver.  We have to get them right.  There is only one chance.  One cannot retrofit a flood relief scheme.  We have to get the consensus of the community.  One often has to try to acquire land or go through landowners' property.  We have to go through procurement and planning.  These are difficult procedures, but the important thing is that we get on with the job.  We now have the funding scheme and we have the national policy, through CFRAM, where people can now see 300 areas in this country on <i>cfram.ie<\/i>that are at risk of flooding, and by this time next year we will have solutions and options to rectify those problems and to put flood relief schemes in place.  It will take a significant amount of time to deliver this programme, but the OPW will move from delivering, on average, six flood relief schemes per year to 20 flood relief schemes per year.  This is a major increase in capacity.<br\/><br\/>We have done exactly what Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has suggested.  We have put in place supports for business, which is something we have not been able to do in the past.  We have put in place supports for businesses that have been flooded and that do not have flood insurance.  I heard very clearly from business owners in Bandon that they did not want a complicated, bureaucratic scheme wrapped up in red tape.  They have been through enough and they want a simple scheme.  We have put in place a Red Cross scheme.  Claimants self-declare up to &euro;5,000 worth of damage, we take them at their word, they get their form stamped by the local authority and they get payment before Christmas.  There is a further &euro;15,000 for each business that has experienced more significant damage.  In the interest of the taxpayer, that is vouched and does take longer, but we can get initial payments of up to &euro;5,000 to every business with up to 20 employees that has been flooded and does not have flood insurance.<br\/><br\/>As I have also made clear, the Government is examining the policy area of flood insurance, looking at what other countries do.  Through an interdepartmental group on flooding, the Department of Finance is examining this and will report to Cabinet in the spring.  Whoever is in Government in the spring will be faced with policy choices in this area.  People are going to have to face up to these choices if we want to ensure we are proactive and not reactive to the issue of flooding.<br\/><br\/>I thank the emergency services, the Red Cross, the Civil Defence, the Garda, local authority workers and the communities that have worked day and night.  We always hear, and rightly so, about the towns, the businesses and the homes that have been flooded, but I know from my briefings with the national emergency co-ordination committee that there are so many homes and businesses that were not flooded as a direct result of their heroic efforts.  More than 700 members of our Defence Forces have been deployed and 20,000 sandbags were filled in County Clare alone.  That is a testament to the inter-agency and community response to this crisis.<br\/><br\/>Senator Hayden is right that there is a balance to be struck between avoiding what used to happen in the past, before 2004, when at the end of the year Ministers would rush to spend because they had to get rid of the money or lose it into an apparent black hole, and spending the money required.  They can now carry over that money.  The sum of money Ministers have been given is an estimate of what they expect to spend this year, but there has been criticism - including of the OPW - when a Minister does not spend all his or her capital in one year.  The prudent thing to do is to ensure that one can only spend the money when it is legally right to do so, when schemes are right.  The capital carryover allows people to do that.  I agree with Senator Hayden on the capital programme.  I do not think anyone in Government would disagree.  We could do with a larger capital programme, but we now have one.  Cleverly, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has built into that programme a review in 2017, so that if the country continues on this track - and that cannot be taken for granted - we will be able to look at further expanding the capital programme at that stage.<br\/><br\/>This Bill is important.  While technical in nature, it will ensure that people on jobseeker's allowance, disability allowance, and the State pension, along with public servants such as nurses, garda&iacute; and teachers, get paid, and that all other pay and pensions funded through voted money, along with pay to suppliers of goods and services across a range of SMEs, is provided.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is to authorise our supplementary expenditure and to approve the expenditure that is incurred during 2015.

I thank the Minister of State for coming to the Seanad today.  I am conscious of the fact that, at a busy time in the dying embers of the current Oireachtas, the Government has generously made 29 minutes available to me to discuss Committee and Final Stages of this legislation, legislation which would cause a fundamental reform of one of our two Houses of Parliament.  When I was elected in 2011, I made a promise and a commitment in my speech at the count centre in the RDS that I would never run again for the Seanad under the electoral system which then applied, a system which I described then, and still describe, as an affront to democracy.  Among the few other reforming actions I have attempted to make in my few years here, I have put a fair bit of effort, with the very able assistance of Shane Conneely, Aoife Casey, Benjamin O&rsquo;Hara, Aoife O&rsquo;Toole and others, into crafting a fundamental reform Bill for the Seanad, as I promised I would do.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Crown:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2369\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2369&amp;amp;pid=JohnCrown&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As the Minister of State is aware, Ireland has had a problem in recent years.  While I do not limit this to the present Government, we found ourselves in some difficult situations five or six years ago that largely could be ascribed to bad governance.  While people were happy to blame banks and the real estate sector, the country had a problem with governance and the reason Ireland had inappropriate governance was because it did not have a good system for electing the people who applied the power and the principles of government to the Republic.  In the D&aacute;il, the principal objection that can be raised is people are elected who are greatly focused on local issues.  In the Seanad, the principal problem is people are elected in a bizarre, elitist, unbalanced and anachronistic electoral system.  Within the confines of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, the Constitution, there is a limit to how much reform can be achieved without a referendum and Members of this House are not in a position to effect a referendum.  Consequently, I put together the maximum reform package possible within the strictures of the current Constitution.  This addresses the core deficit in the Seanad, which is the democratic deficit, that is, the fact that few people in Ireland have the opportunity to participate directly in the election of the representatives in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>In line with the reforms I have put forward, this opportunity would be extended to each citizen of the country, including those citizens who live outside the country.  This is important because the ravages of emigration have taken a disproportionate toll in Ireland and it seems only appropriate to have a vehicle of some kind, as do many other countries, for electoral representation for Irish citizens who, through circumstances that are not of their own making, have found themselves forced to live without the Republic.  The argument has been advanced that were the reforms outlined in this Bill to be made, the Seanad would become a mini-D&aacute;il.  I believe that what would happen is the D&aacute;il would become a mini-Seanad.  There would be a single Chamber, based on universal suffrage and nationally based constituencies, in which any citizen could run with limited interference from the possibility of political parties blocking their appointment.  In this context, Members have all seen how much difficulty that has caused nationwide in this particular electoral cycle.  Any citizen could vote in such a constituency and would not be voting for a local or sectional representative.  Instead, he or she would be voting for somebody as part of a national constituency or as part of a number of national constituencies, namely, those based loosely on the existing panels.  The only difference would be that one could declare one's intention to vote only for one panel and one could declare one's intention to run in only one panel, thus ending the present position in which individuals in Ireland have up to eight votes at the time of a general election because of their multiple votes in the Seanad, as well as their vote for the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>While this may appear to be a rather quixotic ideal, I believe it is entirely feasible.  It is entirely possible within Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, would not subvert the Constitution and would not lead to gridlock.  The Taoiseach's constitutional lock on appointing 11 Members to the Seanad would be retained because it is set out in the Constitution and no part of this Bill challenges the Constitution.  What it would provide is a different kind of Chamber, that is, one in which Members are not focused on local issues.  Incidentally, I do not for a second belittle the importance of local issues.  As has been noted, all politics is local and I understand that.  Local issues affect local people, who need to know they have representation in the halls of power and of Parliament.  It would, however, allow for the possibility of having two different kinds of representative in the national Parliament, namely, those in the D&aacute;il, who still would be able to look after local issues, and a collection of Senators who would be focused on, shall we say, the big picture.<\/p><p>For all these reasons, the Bill fixes the democratic deficit in the Seanad, which really is an affront.  This was evident in the multiple and often correct objections to the Seanad raised at the time of the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad two years ago.  People asked whether they got to vote in the Seanad and noted they did not.  This Bill would extend that right to everyone.  Consequently, as the people have spoken in the aforementioned referendum and have stated their wish to keep alive the Seanad, there is an absolute obligation to reform it.  While it is not the fault of the Minister of State, it is awfully sad that a referendum was held in 1979 on a rather simple, technical issue to change the way in which one votes for Senators but 36 years later, it has not even been possible to implement that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Crown:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2369\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2369&amp;amp;pid=JohnCrown&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I made a promise in 2011 that I would not run again for the Seanad under the current electoral system.

It is regrettable that nothing has happened in relation to extending the university franchise.  However, it would be easy to do that and nothing else, and to do that in isolation would not be appropriate.<\/p> <p>We need to address Seanad reform.  I hope we will get an opportunity to come back into this House to work on that in the years ahead.

Many would argue that the referendum was based on the belief that there would be reform.  I am not at all convinced that we will see any reform coming from the report that was done by former Senators Manning and O'Toole and others, which was a great piece of work.  Based on that, I want to add my voice, and indeed my vote, to the support for Senator Crown's Bill.<\/p> <p>I hope any notion that Senator Crown might depart this House will leave him as quickly as he leaves the House today and that he will return.

I regret to hear that he may not be standing for election, but that is everybody's personal decision.<\/p> <p>I would say, before I address section 1 in detail, that the Government will be opposing this Bill, and I will outline why.  I appreciate that the Bill before us specifically addresses electoral reform, but the stated objective of the Bill suggests an ambition to achieve a far wider Seanad reform.  We all are in agreement - many Senators have said it, as have I, as a former Member of this House - that reform is needed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paudie Coffey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2237\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, I am not convinced that this particular Bill can fully deliver on that as it is currently drafted.  The Government has agreed an approach to Seanad reform which is based on the implementation of procedural reforms and reform of the Seanad university constituencies, and also on advancing reform more generally through considering the recommendations of the working group on Seanad reform which was established by the Taoiseach.  It is in that context that the Government has considered the content and stated purpose of this Bill and has decided to oppose it for a number of reasons that I would like to put on the record.  First of all, administrative issues arise which compromise the ability of the Bill to be implemented in practice.  The Bill, if implemented, could give rise to significant costs which do not appear to have been comprehensively analysed.  That would have a huge impact on the Exchequer.  The Bill would also reduce representation from the sectoral interests and agriculture, labour, industry and commerce in the Seanad.  In the absence of any explanation for this change, the Government is not persuaded that it is justified or that it should be agreed.  <\/p><p>The Bill also removes the nominating bodies entirely from the process of candidate selection for the vocational panels.  The Government is not convinced that the Bill adequately replaces the existing arrangements or that the new arrangements for candidate selection would adequately meet the constitutional requirements in relation to the formation of the vocational panels.  A key feature of the Bill is the extension of the franchise to all local government electors in the State and also to Irish citizens who are resident outside the State who are passport holders.  This would create a second directly elected House of the Oireachtas with a significantly wider franchise which could be more than 5 million votes.  As I have said previously when debating another Seanad reform Bill, if the Seanad was to be so configured and the right to vote in Seanad elections so provided for, the Constitution would then have been framed in this way.  As we all know, it is not.<\/p><p>The Bill does not quantify the likely electorate, but we estimate that more than 5 million people would be entitled to vote under the Bill as drafted.  Clearly, this would have serious cost and administrative implications which I believe are not adequately addressed in the Bill.  On the matter of costs, the Bill provides for a novel way of paying for the running of the Seanad elections, which is that the costs would be met from the parliamentary activities allowance paid to Senators and to the political parties whose members are Senators.  The Government will not be supporting the Bill as currently drafted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#WW00600","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450179000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450179000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Sections 2 to 29, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1450179000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>As it is now 3.30 p.m., I am required to put the following question in accordance with the order of the Seanad on this day: \"That section 30 is hereby agreed to in Committee, that each of the sections undisposed of, Schedules 1 and 2 and the Title are hereby agreed to in Committee and the Bill is, accordingly, reported to the House without amendment, that Fourth Stage is hereby completed and the Bill is hereby passed.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#YY00100","nonspeaker":"Acting Chairman (Senator van Turnhout)"},{"type":"vote","time":1450179000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 17; N\u00edl, 24.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators John Crown and Feargal Quinn; N\u00edl, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden..<\/p><p>Question declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#YY00200","aye":["1157","1116","1196","1147","1159","1140","1128","1136","1123","1115","1139","1127","1145","1171","1126","1164","1176"],"nay":["1148","1138","1150","1208","1165","1151","1124","1130","1166","1117","1172","1152","1173","1135","1161","1132","1134","1118","1187","1153","1169","1170","1125","1163"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2015: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1450179000,"counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#BBB00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450179000,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Sections 1 to 7, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450179000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450179000,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450179000,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.48 p.m. and resumed at 4.05 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011: Motions","time":1450179000,"counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#FFF00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":193,"content":"<p>On 2 December 2015, the Seanad sent the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 to the D&aacute;il with 280 amendments to which the agreement of the D&aacute;il was sought.

This is in response to concerns expressed at the proposal to locate the decision support service in the Courts Service.  The original decision to locate the Office of Public Guardian, as it was then called, in the Courts Service was based on the view that the Office of Wards of Court could form the kernel of the staff of the new body.  However, stakeholders have pointed to the desirability of moving away from the Office of Wards of Court to avoid the false impression that wardship could be perpetuated by another name.  Instead, as I have made clear, wardship will be abolished for adults once existing wards have been discharged or migrated to the new support options.<\/p> <p>The proposal to locate the decision support service in the Mental Health Commission will create a clear boundary between the old wardship system and the new options available for persons with capacity difficulties.  The decision to choose the Mental Health Commission as the location for the decision support service is because the commission has expertise on key functions that will be undertaken by the new body.

Some rebranding may be needed to make this distinction clear.  This will need to be worked out with the Mental Health Commission over the next months.  While logistics and timing will need to be worked out with the Mental Health Commission, this is a very good solution which draws on the experience of a very skilled organisation, yet allows a new architecture to be established.<\/p><p>The proposed amendments are consequential on the Government's decision to move the decision support service to the Mental Health Commission.  All references to the board of the Courts Service are proposed to be replaced by references to the Mental Health Commission.  Many references to the Minister for Justice and Equality are proposed to be replaced by references to the Minister for Health as the Mental Health Commission comes under his remit.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 1 proposes to amend the provisions concerning commencement of the Bill.  It proposes that the Minister for Health be consulted on the commencement of the Bill in view of his responsibility for the Mental Health Commission.  As the decision to move the decision support service to the Mental Health Commission was only taken on 8 December, the Mental Health Commission will need time to prepare for this new task.  As a result, I envisage that the legislation will not be commenced immediately.  It is anticipated that the Bill, if enacted, will be commenced in the second half of 2016 to coincide with the finalisation of preparations to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I never thought we would get to that day.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 2 proposes to delete the reference to the board of the Courts Service as it will now not be responsible for the decision support service.  Similarly, the reference in amendment No. 3 to the Courts Service Act of 1998 is proposed for deletion as no change is now envisaged to that Act.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 73 to 75, inclusive, 77, 81, 82, 84, 87 and 89 replace the references to the Courts Service with the Mental Health Commission.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 78 proposes that the Minister for Health rather than the Minister for Justice and Equality will determine the terms and conditions of the director of the decision support service.  This is because the Minister for Health has responsibility for the Mental Health Commission and the resources allocated to it.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 79 proposes that the director will be a member of staff of the Mental Health Commission rather than of the Courts Service, reflecting the transfer of responsibility to the Mental Health Commission.  Similarly, amendment No. 80 proposes that the staff of the decision support service will be staff of the Mental Health Commission.  It also proposes that the provisions of Part 3 of the Mental Health Act 2001, which deal with the terms and conditions of the staff of the Mental Health Commission, will apply also to the staff of the decision support service.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 88 proposes that any adviser engaged by the director will be subject to the prior agreement of the Minister for Health in view of his responsibility for the Mental Health Commission and the resources available to it.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 90 proposes that the Minister for Health would also have to give approval to the remuneration and allowances for special visitors and general visitors.<\/p><p>Amendments 91, 92 94 to 96, inclusive, 99, 100 and 103 propose to replace all references to the board of the Courts Service with the Mental Health Commission or the commission.  It is proposed that the Mental Health Commission will have the same role as was foreseen for the board of the Courts Service to receive a copy of the annual report prepared by the director on the activities of the decision support service.  It will also receive a copy of the report to be prepared by the director within two years of the commencement of Part 9 on the effectiveness of the functions specified for the director under this legislation.  In addition, it will receive a copy of the report the director must produce after five years reviewing the performance of his or her office and on the functions set out under the Bill.<\/p><p>Amendments 93, 97, 98, 101, 102 and 104 propose that the commission will be obliged to forward these reports to the Minister for Health in view of his responsibility for the Mental Health Commission.  Amendment No. 105 proposes that the Minister for Health rather than the Minister for Justice and Equality will be required to send a copy of such reports to the Oireachtas.  No change is proposed to the provision requiring the reports to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The proposed transfer of responsibility for the decision support service from the Courts Service to the Mental Health Commission will require a series of amendments to section 86 which relates to codes of practice.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 106 proposes to delete paragraph (b) of subsection (3) as it is no longer necessary for the Mental Health Commission to be consulted on codes of practice since the decision support service will be located in the Mental Health Commission.

I appreciate that concerns were expressed previously about the placement of the decision support service within the Courts Service.  Principally, the concern was that the decision support service would not be sufficiently independent as a component of the Courts Service and there was a question whether its work would be open to scrutiny by the Ombudsman.  I am trying to work through why moving the decision support service to the Mental Health Commission will resolve this problem because it places the service within the remit of the Department of Health rather than the Department of Justice and Equality.  Since legal capacity matters should probably be regarded as a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality, I question this move.  Could this lead to confusion because decision support issues might be confused with mental health issues?  Since the remit of the decision support service is much broader than mental health, I wonder about establishing it under the Mental Health Commission.<\/p> <p>I would have thought that this function would have been better to be established as an independent authority similar to the National Disability Authority with reporting responsibilities to the Department of Justice and Equality.  I imagine it is because the move is being made now on Report Stage that there are questions from those who have not been consulted.  There has been extensive consultation on the Bill.  We are jumping the last hurdle and I wonder whether this is the right one that we should be jumping.  I appreciate the placing of the function in the Courts Service was not right, but I do not know whether we are moving it to the right place.  My concerns are echoed by many civil society organisations, persons with disabilities and their representatives.  Why are we doing this now when the preference is to have an independent body that would be under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality?  Such an independent body would be more appropriate.  It would be more in keeping with the spirit of the Bill.

For many of these people it is not so much a question of mental health in terms of a disability or mental functioning or mental capacity.  Many of these people are the result of accidental injury so it is acquired brain damage and the relatives are fairly sensitive on this and do not feel it should come under Mental Health Commission.  It is not a question of mental health, it is not depression, it is not this, that or the other, it is acquired brain damage.  One of these people said to me, that all of those who are family members who are wards of court have said that it in order for them to have confidence in the new system it would need to be delivered outside the Courts Service, preferably as an independent stand alone service responsible to the Government directly.  Obviously this person will be pleased that it is moved out of the Courts Service but I am not sure they are terrifically chuffed by the idea of it being put into the mental health area.  This person wonders if the Minister of State has looked at the question of the fully independent provision of this kind of service.  They welcome the move away from the Courts Service but they find it difficult to understand why it comes under the remit of the Mental Health Commission.  The whole premise of the Bill is that it would be delivered under the Courts Service with the director of the decision support service being appointed by the Courts Service and being responsible to the Courts Service.  They are concerned about that.<\/p><p>I have a bit of a grouse which the Minister of State need not bother to refer to because we have already been through this.  I would point out again the enormous constellation of amendments, all but two of which are from the Government.

If the Mental Health Commission is enshrined in this legislation, will further legislation be required if a future Government decides to change the name of the commission?  Language is important here.  The Title of this Bill has evolved over the years.  It is now known as the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013.  I do not doubt that the name of the Mental Health Commission could change in years to come.  I do not think it matters as long as the job is done and done well.
