One has only got to look at the images coming out of Athlone and further down river, and in south Galway, at the devastation that has been caused.  The IFA yesterday indicated that a further 10,000 acres of farmland have now been flooded.  It is past time that the Government took remedial action.  The multi-agency approach should be abandoned immediately.  My party would propose that there would be one co-ordinating agency set up, similar to what has happened in Holland where they got rid of all the agencies involved with their flooding problems, and that the Taoiseach should chair that co-ordinating body as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p>I, therefore, am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, come before the House to outline exactly the Government's proposals.  The message, whatever it is in Government Buildings, is not getting through to the general population and it certainly is not getting through to the business people and residents of Leitrim village, Carrick-on-Shannon, Athlone and all down along the river as a result of what is happening with the ESB and the weir at Parteen.  All of this is affecting the entire country - this is not a sectional issue - and in any other country, it would be deemed a national crisis.  It is heartbreaking to see the interviews with residents in the most beautiful of homes and the water damage that is being done that will probably result in the houses never being restored to their former glory.<\/p> <p>I want to get some indication from the Leader as to when the Minister for Justice and Equality will come before the House because it would afford an opportunity to highlight the dramatic increase in crime in Dublin, coupled with the Government's policy of slashing Garda numbers which has resulted in many living in fear in their own homes, in businesses under continuous threat of theft and anti-social behaviour on the streets.  The most recent crime statistics show burglaries in Dublin were up almost 15%, year-on-year, rape and sexual assaults up 15.4% and public order offences up 8.4%.<\/p> <p>We, on this side of the House, would submit that this cannot continue.  In fact, Dublin has almost 700 fewer garda&iacute; this year compared to 2010.  Fianna F&aacute;il will reverse this unimaginative and dangerous policy of the Government over the past five years.  We will not only restore the totality of the Garda force to 14,000 but also establish a dedicated Garda public order unit for the city centre to combat drug dealing and anti-social behaviour on the capital's main commercial streets.  When will there be an opportunity for us to outline these policies in more detail in the House before the Minister for Justice and Equality?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#P00100","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We have had the Minister for Justice and Equality in this House on a wide variety of legislation in the past few weeks, and this week is no exception.

I welcome also the jobs announcements - an issue we often overlook - of recent days.  Hundreds of jobs have been announced this morning and yesterday morning.  <br\/><br\/>I welcome the news that at today's Cabinet meeting a change was agreed to the current marriage exemption for children under the age of 18.  This change has been agreed on foot of a motion raised in this House by me, on behalf of Labour Party Senators, proposing the motion, and seconded by Senator Jillian van Turnhout who had also raised the issue.  We had tabled this motion because of concerns arising that a large number of exemptions were being granted to the general rule that children cannot enter marriages in Ireland.  We asked the Minister on 25 June 2014 to look at sections 31 and 33 of the Family Law Act 1995 with a view to ending the practice of allowing exemptions from the rule that parties to a marriage must be over the age of 18 years.  On that date we set out our serious concerns about the possibility of coercion or of children being forced into marriage at a young age.  We noted that approximately 30 weddings had been contracted in Ireland in 2012 where either or both parties were under the age of 18 years.<br\/><br\/>Quite a number of exemptions are being granted in the High Court.  These applications are carried out <i>in camera<\/i>.  We do not have any data on who is applying or the context of the applications but we did refer to a High Court judgment from 2013 where Mr. Justice McMenamin had referred, with concern, to the practice of young people being coerced in some way into marriage contracts.  I am delighted the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, who, on foot of our motion, set up an interdepartmental working group, has brought before the Cabinet a proposal to end the practice.  It is a good day for the Seanad to see a change in policy as a result of a motion tabled in this House.  I commend Labour Women who first raised this as an issue with me and, Senator Jillian van Turnhout, who had also raised the issue.  It is an important child protection issue and a good step forward for children's rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#P01300","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>On my way to work this morning I passed Firhouse, an area of Tallaght, and I thought that is where Ibrahim Halawa should be still celebrating his 20th birthday with his family.

He lacks medical treatment.  Letters from him describe regular beatings, being stripped naked in front of inmates and guards and being hit with metal chains.

After last weekend, we know that no single body is responsible for the Shannon.  A Shannon river basin authority is necessary.

In New Zealand, which is the top ranked country in terms of the ease of starting a business, it takes just one procedure and half a day, and costs less than &euro;100.  We can do this, but we need to set our minds to it and determine what to do.  The job creation of recent years has been successful, but this needs a determined effort.  One approach would be to encourage entrepreneurship and make it easier to start a new business.

The moment the green hammer came down - I think it was at 6.07 p.m. - to say that 196 of the world's nations had reached an agreement on how to regulate climate change was incredible.  It has been hailed as one of the greatest diplomatic successes of this century and, indeed, the last, particularly after the Copenhagen talks collapsed in bitterness and disarray.  At the end of the day, the answer to what we are seeing in terms of the Shannon and all the other issues, such as flooding, rising sea levels, heatwaves and so forth, lies in international co-operation.<\/p> <p>I would also like to raise two points about what is happening, particularly in the Shannon.  It is appalling to see people's homes and their lands being flooded.  I took the train back from Galway the weekend before last and the level of flooding was unbelievable.  It was shocking.  There are impacts on people's farmland and animals as well, not just on people's homes.  The first issue is that for too long we have allowed people to build on floodplains, and that is clearly something that has to stop.  Second, even where successive governments have taken measures to tackle flooding, in the Dargle area in Dublin, for example, people in those homes still cannot get insurance.  There is no obligation on insurance companies to take into account any of the flood defence mechanisms that have been put in place.  I have done some investigation into this with Dublin City Council, which confirmed what I had been told by residents: they cannot get insurance, despite the fact that millions of State money has been spent on putting in place very effective flood defences.<\/p> <p>There is a need to have some type of State-backed insurance policy for people who have been the victims of flooding.  This is the situation in many other countries, but in Ireland, the insurance industry is purely commercial.  The bottom line is that people whose homes have been flooded even once have a duty to declare it and may never get insured.  That is an appalling situation, and one that needs to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#S00100","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I call for a debate on health care.  The Leader arranged for a debate a few weeks ago.  Unfortunately, that was only 45 minutes long and it was not sufficient to critique the Government's failed health service plan and policies.  Even top officials in the HSE over the weekend were talking about a lack of vision, a lack of resources and a lack of capacity.  We saw from the now-averted nurses' strike that we have very real problems on the front line in our health service.  None of that happened by accident.  It happened through five budgets supported by all the Members on the Government benches who took money and capacity out of our health services.  Our hospitals, primary care, mental health services and supports for people with disabilities were all stripped of resources and hacked away at over the past five years.<\/p> <p>Today, Sinn F&eacute;in launched its Better for Health policy document, which is the first time any party has set out a costed plan for universal healthcare.  Obviously during the course of the election campaign, we will go toe-to-toe with the Government parties and others on that.  The Government has now abandoned its policy of universal health insurance, and very senior officials in the HSE are now saying what many of us in the Opposition had been saying for a long time, namely, that the Government and the country is rudderless when it comes to health care and that there is no leadership coming from the Government, the Minister or the Department.  It is very serious and is having an impact on patient care.  The crisis has driven up waiting times in many specialties, including in Waterford, the Leader's own area, where key services, such as opthalmology, ENT and others, are at crisis point.

Sinn F&eacute;in has made out that consultants are being paid too much.  We have a big challenge in this country with the recruitment of medical staff.  One of the challenges we are going to have to face over the next four or five years is the appropriate remuneration for people who have worked to get to the grade they are in and who can provide the expertise that is required in areas like orthopaedics and ear, nose and throat.  The whole transplant area is of particular concern.  Approximately 150 kidney transplants are done in this country each year, whereas more than 300 such procedures are done annually in Norway, which has a similar population.  The reason for this discrepancy is that we cannot get the consultants we require to provide the service we want to provide.<\/p> <p>I want to speak about last week's incident when two Members of the Oireachtas were conveyed to Limerick Prison to avoid having to pay fines.  It is important to outline for the public that the attachment of earnings legislation comes into place on 11 January next.  The day when those who fail to pay the fines imposed on them for committing crimes are carted off to prison will be behind us from that date because the courts will have the power to make an order to have the payment come from the earnings of such people.  This is a welcome development, particularly at a time when over 50% of those admitted to our prisons are admitted for non-payment of fines.  Approximately 89,000 warrants are with the Garda to be executed for non-payment of fines.  We should have implemented this significant change a long time ago.  I am delighted this measure is coming into place on 11 January next.  Members of the Oireachtas who want to break the law from now on have to realise that the fines imposed on them will be taken from their earnings.  This will prevent the time of the Garda, the Prison Service and the Courts Service from being wasted as it was last week.  It is a welcome development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#T00800","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#T00900","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>We will see it put in place on 11 January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#T01000","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I second the proposal on the Order of Business that has been made by Senator Mooney.<\/p> <p>I do not think the Minister for Health is doing his job.  He has been a complete failure since he was appointed.  I know he was put in there to bury his political ambition to become the leader of Fine Gael.  The Taoiseach's decision to appoint him to the Department for Health has been very successful from that perspective because he has proven to be a complete and utter disaster in that role.  This was evident once again last night when it was decided to postpone elective surgery that was due to take place today.  People were waiting and ready to have their operations, but they were all cancelled because the HSE and the Minister would not make an agreement with Liam Doran and the nurses.  They subsequently got a great deal, and now there are claims coming in.  I heard Mr. Bell of SIPTU on the radio today saying that the ambulance drivers, attendants, doctors and everyone else he represents who is involved in accident and emergency all want whatever the nurses are getting.<\/p> <p>I will put this into context.  The former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and the Taoiseach closed the accident and emergency unit at Roscommon acute general hospital.  If that unit were available now - it was very successful when it was open - it would take pressure off Galway.  Its closure is one of the greatest failures of the Government.  The people of County Roscommon were lied to and betrayed by those who gave a commitment prior to the 2011 general election.  The commitment in question resulted in the election of two Fine Gael Deputies in the Roscommon-South Leitrim constituency.  Given the chaos that will ensue in the future in the whole hospital system, the Minister would be better engaged going to the accident and emergency department at University Hospital Galway and other such departments throughout the country to study what is happening on the ground and to see how things can be improved.  There is no reason a patient who needs attention and immediate treatment cannot be brought directly to a bed in a hospital if a doctor feels that person should qualify.  That is happening without going through the accident and emergency process in some hospitals where there is a relationship between the consultants and the general practitioners.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Terry Leyden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=636\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is an old system which needs to be changed but the Minister will certainly not change anything.

However, it is not the only area in which the Government is in serious dereliction of its duty.  Last Thursday, the Master of the High Court highlighted an area where the failure to address the concerns of people who are finding themselves before the courts, brought there by the banks, is a scandal.  The Master did the State some service by highlighting the case of a person whose house could have been sold for &euro;90,000 but was subsequently sold off as part of a bulk lot to an equity fund.  It transpires that only approximately &euro;60,000 was obtained and the person is responsible for the difference.  Therefore, the failure of the State to address this is adding to the crises people are experiencing.  It is indicative of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act under which a veto was given to the banks and the bankruptcy legislation in respect of which the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, spent two to three years vacillating before introducing an inadequate Act which we argued against in the House.

This is the tenth time his court case has been postponed.  Some 493 other people are on trial with him at the same time.  It is a mass trial.  He has been held in captivity for over 852 days and has not been afforded a fair trial.  The concern is about the Irish Government's activities, or lack thereof.  As I have said many times before, Egyptian law 140 allows for a prisoner to be repatriated to his home country before a trial.  Although the Government and Minister said it could not be done, they silently supported a law 140 application in February.  They forgot to tell anybody about it.  During the summer, they repeatedly said they could not enforce law 140 or ask the Egyptian President to invoke it until after a trial.  Now, they have admitted it could be done but have said it would not be the best possible course of action.  Given the trend of what the Government has said about the case during the past 12 months, it is shocking that it has been inconsistent.<\/p> <p>The Minister was here last week.  The fact that the case is to be heard next Saturday is a cause of concern.  There is grave concern that a death sentence could be passed, as has happened in other cases.  The Government seems unaware that, unlike in the case of Peter Greste, an Australian national whose release was secured by the Australian Prime Minister before his trial, if Ibrahim Halawa is found guilty and sentenced to death, law 140 may not be applicable, given that it applies only in cases in which the sentence can be carried out in the jurisdiction to which a person is repatriated.  The Government does not seem to be concerned about it or aware of it.  Ibrahim Halawa has been tortured and kept in detention for a long time.  Last Sunday was his 20th birthday and he has been in jail since he was 17.  The myriad UN declarations and conventions the Egyptian Government has breached is astonishing.

However, we need to get the message out that towns and villages are open for business.  Unfortunately, many people stayed away from shops in towns over the weekend because of a perception that every place was flooded.  Traders throughout the country want to get the message out that, in the main, businesses are open.<\/p><p>There is a lot of work to be done when the floods have receded and we need the 300 schemes in line for funding under the CFRAM programme to be expedited.  As Senator Hayden said, we also need to have a discussion on flood insurance.  It is an absolute shame that, where major moneys have been expended and good defences put in place, insurance companies have not recognised it.  I was pleased that the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, spoke extensively about this over the weekend and I welcome his determination to address this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#W00700","speaker":"1118","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Senator Mooney said the multi-agency approach to flooding had not worked and should be abandoned in favour of a single agency approach.

The Bill serves two primary purposes.  First, it is necessary to authorise in law all the expenditure that has been undertaken in 2015 on the basis of the Estimates that already have been agreed during the year.  The amounts included in section 1 and Schedule 1 to be appropriated for supply services all relate to amounts included in the Estimates set out in the Revised Estimates Volume 2015 of &euro;41.7 billion in aggregate, as well as the Supplementary Estimates of &euro;1.4 billion.  Second, the passage of the Appropriation Bill 2015 is essential to provide a legal basis for all existing voted expenditure to continue into 2016 in the period before the D&aacute;il votes on the 2016 Estimates.<\/p> <p>Under the rolling multi-annual capital envelopes introduced in budget 2004, Departments may carry over from the current year to the following year unspent capital up to a maximum of 10% of voted capital.  The multi-annual system is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the management by Departments and agencies of capital programmes and projects.  It recognises the difficulties inherent in the planning and profiling of capital expenditure and acknowledges that capital projects may be subject to delay.  The carryover facility allows for a portion of unspent moneys, which would have been lost to the capital programmes and projects concerned under the annual system of allocating capital, to be made available for spending on programme priorities in the subsequent year.  The Appropriation Act determines definitively the capital amounts that may be carried over to the following year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The aggregate amount of proposed capital carryover is just under &euro;112 million, which represents less than 3% of the total capital programme of &euro;3.8 billion.  The proposed amounts to be carried over by Vote are set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill.  The 2016 Revised Estimates volume, to be published in the coming days, will set out detailed financial and key performance information for Departments and offices.  In Part II of the Estimates, for each Vote availing of the capital carryover facility, a table will be included listing the amounts to be deferred by subhead.<\/p><p>The first payroll payments of 2016 are to be paid to staff and pensioners on 1 and 4 January 2016.  Departments and offices must have the funds for these payments in their commercial bank accounts before the end of this year to ensure that staff and pensioners have access to their money by the due dates.  In addition, An Post makes certain payments on an agency basis on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  To disburse payments to social welfare recipients in the first week of January 2016, An Post needs to be pre-funded before the end of 2015 to be in a position to convert electronic fund transfer payments from the Department of Social Protection into real cash and physically transfer it to its network of post offices throughout the country.  These Exchequer pay and pension and social welfare payments will form part of the supply services for 2016 and, consequently, the funds to cover these costs will be included in amounts disbursed from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General's supply account as part of the 2016 supply issues and will come under moneys voted by the D&aacute;il in 2016, in respect of which the usual processes and mechanisms for voted moneys in 2016 will apply.  However, as the funds need to be available in the Paymaster General's supply account before the end of the year to facilitate timely payment, section 3 of the Appropriation Bill includes a specific provision to allow for an advance from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General's supply account of the appropriate amounts of money.  Any amounts advanced to the supply account will be repaid to the Central Fund in January.<\/p><p>The signed Act is required by the Comptroller and Auditor General for clearance of the end-of-year issues from the Exchequer.  Under Article 25.2.1&deg; of the Constitution, the President may not sign a Bill earlier than the fifth day after the date upon which the Bill is presented to him.  However, there is provision in Article 25.2.2&deg; whereby, at the request of the Government and with the prior concurrence of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the President may sign a Bill on an earlier date.  In view of the urgency of this Bill, the provision in Article 25.2.2&deg; is sought and a motion to this effect is placed before the Seanad.  Such an earlier signature motion has been sought in relation to the Appropriation Bill in previous years.<\/p><p>I remarked at the outset that the Appropriation Bill is an essential element of housekeeping which those of us in both Houses of the Oireachtas are required to undertake.  The passing of the Bill will authorise in law all of the expenditure that has been undertaken in 2015 on the basis of the Estimates debate and voted on by the D&aacute;il during the year.  Of fundamental importance to those who depend on our essential public services, and to those on public sector pay, pensions and social welfare payments, the passage of the Appropriation Bill will allow the payments required to deliver these public services to continue into 2016 in the period before the D&aacute;il approves the 2016 Estimates.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#CC00600","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I compliment him on doing a fine job.  Every time we have emergency situations he is certainly doing a good job.  The big debates in this House over recent months were on issues such as health, law and order, legislation on burglaries, home care for the elderly and child care.  Those are the big issues.  We all appreciate that the books must be balanced, and it is very easy to get up on a soapbox and make a speech, but I do not think that is what it is about.  However, there are areas that need to be examined as priorities.  We did not expect the recent terrible flooding.  I do not know how people are able to put up with that, and some of the stories are heartbreaking.  Some of these people have been hit repeatedly and flooded on two or three occasions.  Whatever is decided financially for the future, we have to deal with the flooding as an emergency in the same way that any other country would.  I was very impressed to see the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, lay aside the European rules during the UK's flooding events and order the rivers to be dredged.  I know there is a fisheries element there which needs to be looked at.  Compensation has to be realistic, because even though money has to be found quickly, &euro;5,000 or any money like that is not going to be sufficient to repair the affected properties.<\/p> <p>Regarding An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I do not think there is any value in asking who closed this station or who closed that station.  Burglary is a big issue at the moment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1968\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1968&amp;amp;pid=LabhrasOMurchu&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is not an exaggeration to state that people are petrified in their homes.  We all agree with Mr. Justice Hardiman that, apart from the theft of property involved, breaking into a person's home is an act of aggression.  Having listened to all the arguments, I believe garda&iacute; are still needed at local level.  Neighbourhood Watch and so forth should also be funded.<\/p><p>On the issue of health, which was raised by several Senators, no right-thinking person would agree to allow someone to lie on a trolley for an excessive period.  However, when we see a person of 80 or 90 years on a trolley it strikes at the heart of our compassion.  I am not sure money is always the reason.  There are vested interests in the health service and everyone involved in the system must be prepared to co-operate.  If money is needed to ensure people are given proper care and maintain their dignity, it must be provided.<\/p><p>There is much to be said for providing assistance to allow elderly people to remain in their homes.  I have never met an elderly person who wanted to move into a nursing home because this is invariably viewed as marking the end of their lives.  There are some wonderful nursing homes and Senators will have seen how well they look after elderly people.  If an elderly person can remain at home with a degree of independence, we must ensure resources are provided to support him or her to do so.  The elderly have worked and paid taxes throughout their lives and their loved ones would like them to remain at home.  Many supports, including in the area of security, are available to them.  We should help elderly people who wish to remain at home and live mobile, independent lives.<\/p><p>The issue of children has been discussed in the Chamber on many occasions.  Children are the most vulnerable group in society and we must help parents, whether they are single or married, in whatever way possible.  All Senators will have heard stories about giving with one hand and taking away with the other.  If we are genuinely concerned about the welfare of children and the opportunities afforded to them in life, we must provide them with assistance and support.<\/p><p>All of these issues form part of the budgetary process and it is not easy to prioritise one issue over another.  The least well-off and most vulnerable must be given priority at all times.  It is interesting that these are the people who very often do not have a voice.  The well-off - I am not being anti-capitalist in this matter - are generally well able to make a case for themselves and often do well in budgets.  We have to give the most vulnerable hope and show them that we respect them and want them to retain their dignity.  We must also ensure they are always given priority when finances are being distributed.  Has this been done?  A significant degree of poverty persists.  One need only consider the number of meals and other assistance provided to the poor.  Many people are still going to bed hungry, while others cannot afford to heat their homes.  Unfortunately, because we do not experience poverty ourselves, it often remains below the radar.  The House should discuss the reality on the ground in a non-partisan manner.  I would hate to have people trying to win votes out of people's problems and difficulties.<\/p><p>Some people are too proud to admit that they do not have a single euro to spend.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1968\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1968&amp;amp;pid=LabhrasOMurchu&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One may blame the economy or world situation, but Ireland is a country that has been so good when people in other countries needed help.

I would not say anything about pushing up tax a little if it would help those people because we cannot feel good ourselves - it is not good for our morale - when we see this is happening and we are unable to do anything.  At the end of the day, it is only the legislators who can do this.  We should be discussing specifics but we cannot really go into specifics at this time.  However, I hope that any time we have funding to dispense we will always keep the vulnerable in society at the top of our priority list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#DD00200","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.<\/p> <p>Effectively, the Appropriation Bill is an accounting exercise to balance the books and ensure that there is capital in place for issues or emergencies that may arise.

It was valuable for the Minister of State to be with people and hear from the shopkeepers themselves.  We saw him on television going in and accumulating all of that information.<\/p> <p>There are some interesting points in the Appropriation Bill.  The Minister of State stated that the Supplementary Estimates of &euro;1.4 billion is about 3.3% of the &euro;41.7 billion that the Minister was spending.  In the older days of the public finances, Supplementary Estimates were looked upon askance and regarded as something one should not do.  I suppose we might get worried if it went much over 3.3%, but, in general, we learned the hard way how to run the public finances in Ireland.  We do not wish to unlearn those lessons so there is a serious onus on those seeking Supplementary Estimates to justify what they entail.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State mentioned that the carryover on capital projects is 3% of the value of those projects.  That is a margin, but I suppose the danger would be if the Departments doing the spending begin to regard it as theirs and do not return to the Department of Finance.  One must keep an eye on that aspect.<\/p> <p>I welcome initiatives such as the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service which will put the evaluation of capital projects on an independent and sound basis as distinct from merely advocating projects and providing crude figures, such as that investment as a percentage of GDP is lower than it used to be.  It is the case that GDP is lower than it used to be in the period when the public finances were getting into trouble but one must have sound prudent management of the public finances and proper appraisals of the projects involved.  I would prefer those to be done independently and published well in advance so that they can be discussed in the Houses of the Oireachtas and elsewhere.<\/p> <p>That brings me to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the value-for-money officer under the Constitution.  That is a valuable post in seeking to keep the finances in order so that we do not get back into the troubles and problems of the past.  The Comptroller and Auditor General deals with a &euro;6.6 million budget and &euro;5.9 million in appropriations-in-aid out of a &euro;43.1 billion supply grant and the &euro;3.1 billion carryover.  It is an important post and I often think the Comptroller and Auditor General should be involved more.  Sometimes he waits until what we need is the State Pathologist.  Perhaps he should intervene earlier to state projects are going off the rail.  The Comptroller and Auditor General did intervene, I think, with the agreement of all members of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communication, on the issue of the seven-digit non-sequential postal addresses.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sean D.

I appreciate that the Bill before us is different and I am not criticising what is being done here today.  In general, however, there should be an amber light in the context of pushing the President to sign legislation before he or she has had a good chance to read it and, perhaps, to either point out some things which the Oireachtas might need to consider or refer it to the Council of State or the courts.<\/p><p>The current Oireachtas is nearing the end of its lifetime.

I do not think there is any harm in giving us a couple of minutes to debate this Bill.  While the Seanad is limited in terms of its domain over financial matters, there is nothing wrong with taking a look occasionally at some of the financial issues that come before Government.  I agree with my colleague that the Bill is technical in nature.  I would make two observations.  One relates to the aggregate amount of the capital carryover which as the Minister of State said is &euro;112 million, which represents less than 3% of the total capital programme of &euro;3.8 billion.  That is an incredibly low amount of money to carry over.  Coming up to the end of the year, I hope Departments do not spend their time trying to hasten across the line certain projects, particularly as the limiting factor of time would have the potential to impact on cost.  A  larger amount of capital carryover would be more reflective of the realities relating to capital projects.  In the context of overall Government expenditure in the region of &euro;43 billion - including the &euro;1.4 billion - we still have an incredibly small capital programme.  I am aware we will be addressing that in the coming years but it is important to reflect on where we have come from in terms of the difficulties in repairing the country's economy and finances.  We need to acknowledge that, from a capital perspective, we have taken a very significant hit in recent years in terms of the capital programme.  As a Government, we have taken steps to address that but it will have to be a priority for this or any future Government in the years to come.<\/p> <p>In the context of the purpose of the Bill, it is obviously a sensible measure designed to allow for a carryover into the early week of the new year, from 1 to 4 January 2016.  I wonder whether our accounting measures could be adjusted in order that we are not obliged to put in place an Appropriation Bill to cover such a short period and having to go through the earlier signature motion and so forth.  We have managed to change the tax date from, I think, 5 April back to 31 December and then to 31 October.  Surely there must be a way of changing the way we set out appropriations where it is possible to have a residual sum carried over into the following year without the need to enact specific legislation on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#GG00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>As there are no other contributors, I call on the Minister of State to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#GG00300","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I thank all Senators for their constructive contributions to what is a technical item of legislation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->To pick up where Senator Hayden left off, I agree that it is worth giving time to scrutinise this legislation because that would be a useful overview of where we find ourselves in terms of the public finances.  Undoubtedly, the economic crisis had a profound impact on those finances.  When the Government was elected, the budget deficit stood at 12.5% of GDP.  This year, it is on track to be below 2%.  General Government debt has reduced from a peak of 120% of GDP and is forecasted to decline to close to 90% in 2016.  That is still much too high, but is back in the realm of the European average and is something that we can reduce further in the coming years.<\/p><p>Sustainable public finances are required if the Government is to provide the necessary infrastructure to encourage economic growth and job creation and deliver essential public services to our citizens.  The fiscal adjustment implemented in order to exit the EU-IMF programme of support successfully and return sustainability to the public finances required significant tax increases and expenditure reductions.  Gross voted expenditure was reduced from its peak of just over &euro;63 billion in 2009 to &euro;54 billion in 2014.  In implementing expenditure reductions, the Government's priority was to ensure that a targeted approach was adopted in order to protect key public services and social supports to the greatest extent possible at a time of increasing demand.  It is fair to say that budget 2015 marked a turning point in our recovery, when expenditure reductions were no longer required to meet our fiscal targets and we were in a position to provide targeted increases for front-line services.<\/p><p>Against a background of Exchequer tax receipts being almost &euro;3 billion ahead of profile this year, additional funding has been made available through Supplementary Estimates of &euro;1.4 billion to support key services and social supports.  While the bulk of the additional revenue has gone to pay down debt, the key sectors of health, social protection and education have been prioritised.  These are issues of importance to Senators on all sides of the House and account for more than 80% of gross current expenditure.  The Government has protected core social welfare rates and, under budget 2016, the State pension will be increased by &euro;3 per week.  Though small, this is the first increase in the State pension since 2009.  Our commitment to protecting society's most vulnerable is found in data published by EUROSTAT this year, which showed that Ireland's system of social transfers - the redistribution of wealth and income to those most in need - is among the most effective in Europe at reducing the risk of poverty.<\/p><p>Aside from social transfers, the Government's fundamental reforms to labour market activation represent a significant modernisation of Ireland's tackling of unemployment through a two-pronged approach.  Pathways to Work ensures that the unemployed are given a chance to upskill and rejoin the workforce while the Action Plan for Jobs has directed its efforts towards boosting labour demand through key reforms.  Unemployment has decreased from a peak of over 15% to below 9%.  While that remains too high, it is moving in the right direction towards full employment, which must be our collective relentless pursuit.  I am not just referring to headline full employment, but real full employment, in which we tackle issues like long-term unemployment and people with disabilities wanting to access the workforce but not being afforded the supports to do so.  I challenge the next Oireachtas to do that.<\/p><p>One of the Government's first acts was to reverse the cut to the minimum wage.  From January, the new statutory minimum wage will rise to &euro;9.15 per hour.  Our investment in the health sector has ensured that key front-line services have been maintained and will be enhanced further through initiatives such as extending free general practitioner, GP, care to children under six years of age, which is due to be extended next year to children under 12 years of age.  The additional funding provided to health this year has allowed staffing levels within the sector to be increased by more than 3,700 in the first ten months of 2015, with this increase primarily and rightly concentrated in our hospitals.  The amount to be allocated to health next year will bring funding back to pre-crisis levels, but I take Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s point that it is not all about funding and must be about continuing to reform.  I welcome the initiative taken by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, today in deferring industrial action and considering a number of the proposals that it discussed at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, last night to address the important issues being experienced by front-line nurses in accident and emergency services on a daily basis.<\/p><p>Since the beginning of 2012, we have invested more than &euro;1.25 billion in school buildings, sought to protect DEIS expenditure, which prioritises the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged areas, protected the pupil-teacher ratio and, in budget 2016, reduced the ratio from 28:1 to 27:1 at primary level and from 19:1 to 18.7:1 at second level.  The allocation set out in next year's budget will provide for more than 2,260 new teaching posts, including 600 resource teachers.  The expansion of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme announced in budget 2016 will provide a second free preschool year to 75,000 children and support children with special needs in accessing those preschool years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The social housing strategy aims to deliver 3,100 social housing units in 2016, with 3,000 units to be delivered in 2015.  An additional 10,000 households will receive housing assistance payment in 2016.<br\/><br\/>I want to return to the issue raised by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; regarding the recent flooding.  This issue is very close to my heart and to my ministerial responsibilities.  The recent flooding has clearly highlighted the need for the Government to do exactly what it wants to do, which is to increase significantly our investment in flood risk management in this country.  We cannot get away from the fact that we are seeing more and more severe weather events and we are likely to continue to see that.  We are all aware of the consequences of climate change.  Through our capital plan, we intend to spend more on flood relief in the next five years - &euro;430 million - than has been spent in the last 20 years.  That cannot be lost on people.  While I very much welcome the generous remarks of Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, it is important that people do not play politics with this.  People have gone through a very difficult few weeks.  We have had a national weather crisis.  We have seen over a month's worth of rainfall in 24 hours in parts of this country.<br\/><br\/>Yesterday, I met with the people in Bandon and Skibbereen.  I met with people whose shops had been flooded again.  This is a situation we all have to resolve, but we must also be honest with people.  Major flood relief schemes take about five years to deliver.  We have to get them right.  There is only one chance.  One cannot retrofit a flood relief scheme.  We have to get the consensus of the community.  One often has to try to acquire land or go through landowners' property.  We have to go through procurement and planning.  These are difficult procedures, but the important thing is that we get on with the job.  We now have the funding scheme and we have the national policy, through CFRAM, where people can now see 300 areas in this country on <i>cfram.ie<\/i>that are at risk of flooding, and by this time next year we will have solutions and options to rectify those problems and to put flood relief schemes in place.  It will take a significant amount of time to deliver this programme, but the OPW will move from delivering, on average, six flood relief schemes per year to 20 flood relief schemes per year.  This is a major increase in capacity.<br\/><br\/>We have done exactly what Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has suggested.  We have put in place supports for business, which is something we have not been able to do in the past.  We have put in place supports for businesses that have been flooded and that do not have flood insurance.  I heard very clearly from business owners in Bandon that they did not want a complicated, bureaucratic scheme wrapped up in red tape.  They have been through enough and they want a simple scheme.  We have put in place a Red Cross scheme.  Claimants self-declare up to &euro;5,000 worth of damage, we take them at their word, they get their form stamped by the local authority and they get payment before Christmas.  There is a further &euro;15,000 for each business that has experienced more significant damage.  In the interest of the taxpayer, that is vouched and does take longer, but we can get initial payments of up to &euro;5,000 to every business with up to 20 employees that has been flooded and does not have flood insurance.<br\/><br\/>As I have also made clear, the Government is examining the policy area of flood insurance, looking at what other countries do.  Through an interdepartmental group on flooding, the Department of Finance is examining this and will report to Cabinet in the spring.  Whoever is in Government in the spring will be faced with policy choices in this area.  People are going to have to face up to these choices if we want to ensure we are proactive and not reactive to the issue of flooding.<br\/><br\/>I thank the emergency services, the Red Cross, the Civil Defence, the Garda, local authority workers and the communities that have worked day and night.  We always hear, and rightly so, about the towns, the businesses and the homes that have been flooded, but I know from my briefings with the national emergency co-ordination committee that there are so many homes and businesses that were not flooded as a direct result of their heroic efforts.  More than 700 members of our Defence Forces have been deployed and 20,000 sandbags were filled in County Clare alone.  That is a testament to the inter-agency and community response to this crisis.<br\/><br\/>Senator Hayden is right that there is a balance to be struck between avoiding what used to happen in the past, before 2004, when at the end of the year Ministers would rush to spend because they had to get rid of the money or lose it into an apparent black hole, and spending the money required.  They can now carry over that money.  The sum of money Ministers have been given is an estimate of what they expect to spend this year, but there has been criticism - including of the OPW - when a Minister does not spend all his or her capital in one year.  The prudent thing to do is to ensure that one can only spend the money when it is legally right to do so, when schemes are right.  The capital carryover allows people to do that.  I agree with Senator Hayden on the capital programme.  I do not think anyone in Government would disagree.  We could do with a larger capital programme, but we now have one.  Cleverly, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has built into that programme a review in 2017, so that if the country continues on this track - and that cannot be taken for granted - we will be able to look at further expanding the capital programme at that stage.<br\/><br\/>This Bill is important.  While technical in nature, it will ensure that people on jobseeker's allowance, disability allowance, and the State pension, along with public servants such as nurses, garda&iacute; and teachers, get paid, and that all other pay and pensions funded through voted money, along with pay to suppliers of goods and services across a range of SMEs, is provided.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is to authorise our supplementary expenditure and to approve the expenditure that is incurred during 2015.

I thank the Minister of State for coming to the Seanad today.  I am conscious of the fact that, at a busy time in the dying embers of the current Oireachtas, the Government has generously made 29 minutes available to me to discuss Committee and Final Stages of this legislation, legislation which would cause a fundamental reform of one of our two Houses of Parliament.  When I was elected in 2011, I made a promise and a commitment in my speech at the count centre in the RDS that I would never run again for the Seanad under the electoral system which then applied, a system which I described then, and still describe, as an affront to democracy.  Among the few other reforming actions I have attempted to make in my few years here, I have put a fair bit of effort, with the very able assistance of Shane Conneely, Aoife Casey, Benjamin O&rsquo;Hara, Aoife O&rsquo;Toole and others, into crafting a fundamental reform Bill for the Seanad, as I promised I would do.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Crown:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2369\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2369&amp;amp;pid=JohnCrown&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As the Minister of State is aware, Ireland has had a problem in recent years.  While I do not limit this to the present Government, we found ourselves in some difficult situations five or six years ago that largely could be ascribed to bad governance.  While people were happy to blame banks and the real estate sector, the country had a problem with governance and the reason Ireland had inappropriate governance was because it did not have a good system for electing the people who applied the power and the principles of government to the Republic.  In the D&aacute;il, the principal objection that can be raised is people are elected who are greatly focused on local issues.  In the Seanad, the principal problem is people are elected in a bizarre, elitist, unbalanced and anachronistic electoral system.  Within the confines of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, the Constitution, there is a limit to how much reform can be achieved without a referendum and Members of this House are not in a position to effect a referendum.  Consequently, I put together the maximum reform package possible within the strictures of the current Constitution.  This addresses the core deficit in the Seanad, which is the democratic deficit, that is, the fact that few people in Ireland have the opportunity to participate directly in the election of the representatives in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>In line with the reforms I have put forward, this opportunity would be extended to each citizen of the country, including those citizens who live outside the country.  This is important because the ravages of emigration have taken a disproportionate toll in Ireland and it seems only appropriate to have a vehicle of some kind, as do many other countries, for electoral representation for Irish citizens who, through circumstances that are not of their own making, have found themselves forced to live without the Republic.  The argument has been advanced that were the reforms outlined in this Bill to be made, the Seanad would become a mini-D&aacute;il.  I believe that what would happen is the D&aacute;il would become a mini-Seanad.  There would be a single Chamber, based on universal suffrage and nationally based constituencies, in which any citizen could run with limited interference from the possibility of political parties blocking their appointment.  In this context, Members have all seen how much difficulty that has caused nationwide in this particular electoral cycle.  Any citizen could vote in such a constituency and would not be voting for a local or sectional representative.  Instead, he or she would be voting for somebody as part of a national constituency or as part of a number of national constituencies, namely, those based loosely on the existing panels.  The only difference would be that one could declare one's intention to vote only for one panel and one could declare one's intention to run in only one panel, thus ending the present position in which individuals in Ireland have up to eight votes at the time of a general election because of their multiple votes in the Seanad, as well as their vote for the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>While this may appear to be a rather quixotic ideal, I believe it is entirely feasible.  It is entirely possible within Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, would not subvert the Constitution and would not lead to gridlock.  The Taoiseach's constitutional lock on appointing 11 Members to the Seanad would be retained because it is set out in the Constitution and no part of this Bill challenges the Constitution.  What it would provide is a different kind of Chamber, that is, one in which Members are not focused on local issues.  Incidentally, I do not for a second belittle the importance of local issues.  As has been noted, all politics is local and I understand that.  Local issues affect local people, who need to know they have representation in the halls of power and of Parliament.  It would, however, allow for the possibility of having two different kinds of representative in the national Parliament, namely, those in the D&aacute;il, who still would be able to look after local issues, and a collection of Senators who would be focused on, shall we say, the big picture.<\/p><p>For all these reasons, the Bill fixes the democratic deficit in the Seanad, which really is an affront.  This was evident in the multiple and often correct objections to the Seanad raised at the time of the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad two years ago.  People asked whether they got to vote in the Seanad and noted they did not.  This Bill would extend that right to everyone.  Consequently, as the people have spoken in the aforementioned referendum and have stated their wish to keep alive the Seanad, there is an absolute obligation to reform it.  While it is not the fault of the Minister of State, it is awfully sad that a referendum was held in 1979 on a rather simple, technical issue to change the way in which one votes for Senators but 36 years later, it has not even been possible to implement that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Crown:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2369\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2369&amp;amp;pid=JohnCrown&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I made a promise in 2011 that I would not run again for the Seanad under the current electoral system.

It is regrettable that nothing has happened in relation to extending the university franchise.  However, it would be easy to do that and nothing else, and to do that in isolation would not be appropriate.<\/p> <p>We need to address Seanad reform.  I hope we will get an opportunity to come back into this House to work on that in the years ahead.

Many would argue that the referendum was based on the belief that there would be reform.  I am not at all convinced that we will see any reform coming from the report that was done by former Senators Manning and O'Toole and others, which was a great piece of work.  Based on that, I want to add my voice, and indeed my vote, to the support for Senator Crown's Bill.<\/p> <p>I hope any notion that Senator Crown might depart this House will leave him as quickly as he leaves the House today and that he will return.

I regret to hear that he may not be standing for election, but that is everybody's personal decision.<\/p> <p>I would say, before I address section 1 in detail, that the Government will be opposing this Bill, and I will outline why.  I appreciate that the Bill before us specifically addresses electoral reform, but the stated objective of the Bill suggests an ambition to achieve a far wider Seanad reform.  We all are in agreement - many Senators have said it, as have I, as a former Member of this House - that reform is needed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paudie Coffey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2237\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, I am not convinced that this particular Bill can fully deliver on that as it is currently drafted.  The Government has agreed an approach to Seanad reform which is based on the implementation of procedural reforms and reform of the Seanad university constituencies, and also on advancing reform more generally through considering the recommendations of the working group on Seanad reform which was established by the Taoiseach.  It is in that context that the Government has considered the content and stated purpose of this Bill and has decided to oppose it for a number of reasons that I would like to put on the record.  First of all, administrative issues arise which compromise the ability of the Bill to be implemented in practice.  The Bill, if implemented, could give rise to significant costs which do not appear to have been comprehensively analysed.  That would have a huge impact on the Exchequer.  The Bill would also reduce representation from the sectoral interests and agriculture, labour, industry and commerce in the Seanad.  In the absence of any explanation for this change, the Government is not persuaded that it is justified or that it should be agreed.  <\/p><p>The Bill also removes the nominating bodies entirely from the process of candidate selection for the vocational panels.  The Government is not convinced that the Bill adequately replaces the existing arrangements or that the new arrangements for candidate selection would adequately meet the constitutional requirements in relation to the formation of the vocational panels.  A key feature of the Bill is the extension of the franchise to all local government electors in the State and also to Irish citizens who are resident outside the State who are passport holders.  This would create a second directly elected House of the Oireachtas with a significantly wider franchise which could be more than 5 million votes.  As I have said previously when debating another Seanad reform Bill, if the Seanad was to be so configured and the right to vote in Seanad elections so provided for, the Constitution would then have been framed in this way.  As we all know, it is not.<\/p><p>The Bill does not quantify the likely electorate, but we estimate that more than 5 million people would be entitled to vote under the Bill as drafted.  Clearly, this would have serious cost and administrative implications which I believe are not adequately addressed in the Bill.  On the matter of costs, the Bill provides for a novel way of paying for the running of the Seanad elections, which is that the costs would be met from the parliamentary activities allowance paid to Senators and to the political parties whose members are Senators.  The Government will not be supporting the Bill as currently drafted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#WW00600","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450179000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450179000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Sections 2 to 29, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1450179000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>As it is now 3.30 p.m., I am required to put the following question in accordance with the order of the Seanad on this day: \"That section 30 is hereby agreed to in Committee, that each of the sections undisposed of, Schedules 1 and 2 and the Title are hereby agreed to in Committee and the Bill is, accordingly, reported to the House without amendment, that Fourth Stage is hereby completed and the Bill is hereby passed.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#YY00100","nonspeaker":"Acting Chairman (Senator van Turnhout)"},{"type":"vote","time":1450179000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 17; N\u00edl, 24.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators John Crown and Feargal Quinn; N\u00edl, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden..<\/p><p>Question declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#YY00200","aye":["1157","1116","1196","1147","1159","1140","1128","1136","1123","1115","1139","1127","1145","1171","1126","1164","1176"],"nay":["1148","1138","1150","1208","1165","1151","1124","1130","1166","1117","1172","1152","1173","1135","1161","1132","1134","1118","1187","1153","1169","1170","1125","1163"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2015: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1450179000,"counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#BBB00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450179000,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Sections 1 to 7, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450179000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450179000,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450179000,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.48 p.m. and resumed at 4.05 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011: Motions","time":1450179000,"counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#FFF00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":193,"content":"<p>On 2 December 2015, the Seanad sent the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 to the D&aacute;il with 280 amendments to which the agreement of the D&aacute;il was sought.

This is in response to concerns expressed at the proposal to locate the decision support service in the Courts Service.  The original decision to locate the Office of Public Guardian, as it was then called, in the Courts Service was based on the view that the Office of Wards of Court could form the kernel of the staff of the new body.  However, stakeholders have pointed to the desirability of moving away from the Office of Wards of Court to avoid the false impression that wardship could be perpetuated by another name.  Instead, as I have made clear, wardship will be abolished for adults once existing wards have been discharged or migrated to the new support options.<\/p> <p>The proposal to locate the decision support service in the Mental Health Commission will create a clear boundary between the old wardship system and the new options available for persons with capacity difficulties.  The decision to choose the Mental Health Commission as the location for the decision support service is because the commission has expertise on key functions that will be undertaken by the new body.

Some rebranding may be needed to make this distinction clear.  This will need to be worked out with the Mental Health Commission over the next months.  While logistics and timing will need to be worked out with the Mental Health Commission, this is a very good solution which draws on the experience of a very skilled organisation, yet allows a new architecture to be established.<\/p><p>The proposed amendments are consequential on the Government's decision to move the decision support service to the Mental Health Commission.  All references to the board of the Courts Service are proposed to be replaced by references to the Mental Health Commission.  Many references to the Minister for Justice and Equality are proposed to be replaced by references to the Minister for Health as the Mental Health Commission comes under his remit.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 1 proposes to amend the provisions concerning commencement of the Bill.  It proposes that the Minister for Health be consulted on the commencement of the Bill in view of his responsibility for the Mental Health Commission.  As the decision to move the decision support service to the Mental Health Commission was only taken on 8 December, the Mental Health Commission will need time to prepare for this new task.  As a result, I envisage that the legislation will not be commenced immediately.  It is anticipated that the Bill, if enacted, will be commenced in the second half of 2016 to coincide with the finalisation of preparations to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I never thought we would get to that day.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 2 proposes to delete the reference to the board of the Courts Service as it will now not be responsible for the decision support service.  Similarly, the reference in amendment No. 3 to the Courts Service Act of 1998 is proposed for deletion as no change is now envisaged to that Act.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 73 to 75, inclusive, 77, 81, 82, 84, 87 and 89 replace the references to the Courts Service with the Mental Health Commission.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 78 proposes that the Minister for Health rather than the Minister for Justice and Equality will determine the terms and conditions of the director of the decision support service.  This is because the Minister for Health has responsibility for the Mental Health Commission and the resources allocated to it.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 79 proposes that the director will be a member of staff of the Mental Health Commission rather than of the Courts Service, reflecting the transfer of responsibility to the Mental Health Commission.  Similarly, amendment No. 80 proposes that the staff of the decision support service will be staff of the Mental Health Commission.  It also proposes that the provisions of Part 3 of the Mental Health Act 2001, which deal with the terms and conditions of the staff of the Mental Health Commission, will apply also to the staff of the decision support service.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 88 proposes that any adviser engaged by the director will be subject to the prior agreement of the Minister for Health in view of his responsibility for the Mental Health Commission and the resources available to it.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 90 proposes that the Minister for Health would also have to give approval to the remuneration and allowances for special visitors and general visitors.<\/p><p>Amendments 91, 92 94 to 96, inclusive, 99, 100 and 103 propose to replace all references to the board of the Courts Service with the Mental Health Commission or the commission.  It is proposed that the Mental Health Commission will have the same role as was foreseen for the board of the Courts Service to receive a copy of the annual report prepared by the director on the activities of the decision support service.  It will also receive a copy of the report to be prepared by the director within two years of the commencement of Part 9 on the effectiveness of the functions specified for the director under this legislation.  In addition, it will receive a copy of the report the director must produce after five years reviewing the performance of his or her office and on the functions set out under the Bill.<\/p><p>Amendments 93, 97, 98, 101, 102 and 104 propose that the commission will be obliged to forward these reports to the Minister for Health in view of his responsibility for the Mental Health Commission.  Amendment No. 105 proposes that the Minister for Health rather than the Minister for Justice and Equality will be required to send a copy of such reports to the Oireachtas.  No change is proposed to the provision requiring the reports to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The proposed transfer of responsibility for the decision support service from the Courts Service to the Mental Health Commission will require a series of amendments to section 86 which relates to codes of practice.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 106 proposes to delete paragraph (b) of subsection (3) as it is no longer necessary for the Mental Health Commission to be consulted on codes of practice since the decision support service will be located in the Mental Health Commission.

I appreciate that concerns were expressed previously about the placement of the decision support service within the Courts Service.  Principally, the concern was that the decision support service would not be sufficiently independent as a component of the Courts Service and there was a question whether its work would be open to scrutiny by the Ombudsman.  I am trying to work through why moving the decision support service to the Mental Health Commission will resolve this problem because it places the service within the remit of the Department of Health rather than the Department of Justice and Equality.  Since legal capacity matters should probably be regarded as a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality, I question this move.  Could this lead to confusion because decision support issues might be confused with mental health issues?  Since the remit of the decision support service is much broader than mental health, I wonder about establishing it under the Mental Health Commission.<\/p> <p>I would have thought that this function would have been better to be established as an independent authority similar to the National Disability Authority with reporting responsibilities to the Department of Justice and Equality.  I imagine it is because the move is being made now on Report Stage that there are questions from those who have not been consulted.  There has been extensive consultation on the Bill.  We are jumping the last hurdle and I wonder whether this is the right one that we should be jumping.  I appreciate the placing of the function in the Courts Service was not right, but I do not know whether we are moving it to the right place.  My concerns are echoed by many civil society organisations, persons with disabilities and their representatives.  Why are we doing this now when the preference is to have an independent body that would be under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality?  Such an independent body would be more appropriate.  It would be more in keeping with the spirit of the Bill.

The thought of placing the decision support service within the Courts Service was not one with which they were comfortable.  The organisations that have been in contact with us have asked for an office with an independent function separate from the Courts Service with a director recruited through the Public Appointments Service.  This would afford independence, transparency and an opportunity for a fresh start with the new support structure.  If the Minister of State has taken this step, why did she go with the Mental Health Commission rather than set it up as an independent body in its own right, which is what was called for?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#NNN00300","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is a bit odd - I have commented on this before - that we have 113 amendments at this very late Stage, Report Stage, and all but two of them are Government amendments.  That is astonishing.  I hope the Minister of State will convey this to her colleagues and to those involved in the Civil Service in the drafting.  It is both a drafting and a political matter.  It is shameful that we have this kind of thing, a backlog or a furious push of legislation every Christmas.  Why does it happen?  It is bad management and it should be stopped.<\/p> <p>With regard to the particular import of these amendments, they are not all drafting amendments.  Some of them are and some of them are just changing words, that is, tinkering around.  Even though there is quite a considerable number of them, I suppose that is fair enough although, God knows, one would imagine it would have been spotted before now.<\/p> <p>One of the principal amendments in the entire range deals with taking the function out of the Courts Service and putting it into the Mental Health Commission.  I have been contacted by some of the relatives and they are not particularly happy about this.  They were not happy about it being part of the Courts Service because of their experience with wards being referred to as lunatics and all this unhelpful language.<\/p> <p>I am asked if the Minister of State knows what she is doing.  For many of these people it is not so much a question of mental health in terms of a disability, mental functioning or mental capacity.  Many of these people are the way they are as a result of accidental injury.  It is acquired brain damage and the relatives are fairly sensitive about this and do not feel it should come under Mental Health Commission.  It is not a question of mental health, depression or this, that or the other, it is acquired brain damage.  One of these people said to me that all those who have family members who are wards of court have said that it for them to have confidence in the new system, it would need to be delivered outside the Courts Service, preferably as an independent stand-alone service responsible to the Government directly.  This person will be pleased that it is moved out of the Courts Service but I am not sure the person is terrifically chuffed by the idea of it being put into the mental health area.  This person wonders if the Minister of State has looked at the question of the fully independent provision of this kind of service.  This person welcome the move away from the Courts Service but finds it difficult to understand why it comes under the remit of the Mental Health Commission.  The premise of the Bill is that it would be delivered under the Courts Service with the director of the decision support service being appointed by the Courts Service and being responsible to the Courts Service.  The person I referred to is concerned about that.<\/p> <p>I have a bit of a grouse which the Minister of State need not bother to refer to because we have been through this.  I would point out again the enormous constellation of amendments, all but two of which are from the Government.  The other issue is that I am concerned at the introduction, at this late Stage, of a move, without consultation with the relatives, as I understand it, from the Courts Service, which is welcomed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As somebody said to me years ago when they were talking about a translation of <i>Finnegans Wake<\/i>, &quot;it is being translated into Japanese, but out of what?&quot;.

If the Mental Health Commission is enshrined in this legislation, will further legislation be required if a future Government decides to change the name of the commission?  Language is important here.  The Title of this Bill has evolved over the years.  It is now known as the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013.  I do not doubt that the name of the Mental Health Commission could change in years to come.  I do not think it matters as long as the job is done and done well.

I suppose people have concerns, but sometimes it is better to go with a proposal on the basis that it is better than what is there at the moment.

No stigma or anything else should be attached to it.

We are talking about a rebranding exercise whereby we will have the Mental Health Commission and the decision support service.

None of us here can say there have not been times when we lacked capacity.  Regardless of whether they were self-inflicted, there clearly have been such times.  Several weeks ago, some people came to me and said a person they loved very deeply had acquired a brain injury, although not a very substantial one.  The greatest difficulty with brain injury is that while sometimes it does not look substantial, it can be a great imposition.

On review of the amendments proposed on Committee Stage, it was considered that the formulation proposed was not sufficiently tight to make clear to a co-decision-maker that he or she must act in accordance not only with the provisions of the Bill generally but specifically with the provisions of the co-decision-making agreement as they are the expression of the will and preferences of the appointer.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 15 proposes to delete the word \"time\" from section 21(3) as amended on Committee Stage.

The amendment would replace the definition of &quot;mental capacity&quot; in the Bill with a recognition of the legal capacity which all adults enjoy.<\/p><p>This amendment is based on the explicit recognition of legal capacity and the principle set out by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities that a functional assessment of mental capacity should never be used to restrict or deny a person&rsquo;s legal capacity, even in respect of a single decision. The amendment draws on a proposal contained in A Statutory Framework for the Right to Legal Capacity and Supported Decision-Making by the Canadian Association for Community Living, CACL, which was published in 2012.  The CACL was a key actor in the reform of Canadian adult guardianship law in the 1990s.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It resulted in innovative statutory mechanisms such as co-decision-making and representative decision-making agreements, which influenced the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill here.<br\/><br\/>Functional assessments of mental capacity are now understood to violate human rights.  In the terms of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, functional assessments of mental capacity are &quot;discriminatorily applied to people with disabilities&quot;.  In April 2014 the committee stated:<\/p><blockquote>[The] functional approach is flawed for two key reasons.  The first is that it is discriminatorily applied to people with disabilities.  The second is that it presumes to be able to accurately assess the inner-workings of the human mind and to then deny a core human right &ndash; the right to equal recognition before the law &ndash; when an individual does not pass the assessment.  In all these approaches, a person's disability and\/or decision-making skills are taken as legitimate grounds for denying his or her legal capacity and lowering his or her status as a person before the law.  Article 12 does not permit such discriminatory denial of legal capacity, but rather requires that support be provided in the exercise of legal capacity.<\/blockquote><p>Instead of requiring a person who needs support with decision-making to undergo an assessment of his or her mental capacity, these supports should be provided for the person to avail of at his or her own discretion.  The availability of supports should also be combined with a parallel process to explore the person's will and preferences, something we have debated quite a lot on the floor of the House, so that the decision the person wishes to make becomes clear.  This approach avoids any need for an assessment of mental capacity.<br\/><br\/>Section 3 of the Bill makes a person's ability to enter into different support arrangements contingent on the individual's mental capacity.  This is quite a high standard for an individual to reach and will mean that some people will not be found eligible to make assisted decision-making agreements and co-decision-making agreements, even where this is the form of support the individual and his or her supporters would most likely use.<br\/><br\/>Under the Bill in its current form, the term &quot;presumption of capacity&quot; is used to try to prevent discriminatory application of functional assessments of mental capacity.  However, two international human rights scholars, Oliver Lewis and Michael Bach, stated at a meeting in Belfast in April 2014 that a presumption of mental capacity is meaningless as it does not help to protect the individual's human rights.  They argue that the right to equal recognition before the law, from which the right to legal capacity stems, is a guarantee, not a presumption.  In contrast, a presumption can be rebutted if evidence is provided to demonstrate that a certain individual is not worthy of equal recognition before the law.<br\/><br\/>This amendment is required to ensure Ireland meets its obligations under international human rights law and will, upon ratification, comply with Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which we all wish to do.

The amendment requires also a definition.<\/p> <p>It seems to be a reasonable amendment because it is only with regard to a situation of last resort - in other words, where everything else has failed and we have a situation where the individual centrally concerned does not have the capacity, whether legal or mental, to make a decision, so no decision is made and the person is left in limbo.  We obviously need somebody to be able to make that decision.  This is where the phrase \"legal capacity\" comes in.  The history of the patient and his or her past decisions and attitudes is used to assess what type of decision he or she might have made in the circumstances.  In addition to this, under subsection 3 people must be able to provide a reasonable account of the reasons they arrived at a decision.  This seems to be a reasonable amendment.  It covers a situation where no decision involving the person can be arrived at.<\/p> <p>This deals with legal and mental capacity and assisted decision-making, and I have some remarks on what the Minister of State said about the independent agency.  Let the record show the Minister of State said of course it should be an independent agency.  This is a very honest point and I salute the Minister of State for making it, but in legislation and in the Seanad, what we need is to hold the Government to what is best for the citizen and not what was said in a radio interview as a result of a media blitz on quangos.  People say they will never establish another one.  Really?  Not even if it is necessary?  Not even if it is in the best interests of patients?  The Minister of State said it was the best interests of patients.  I do not think this is proper; we should have what is best for the individual.  The Minister of State also failed to give what, to my mind, was adequate reassurance about the funding.  She said it would happen if people believed in this, and there is an element of conditionality already.  Not everybody, presumably, does believe in this.  I am a little bit concerned.  The amendment goes a long way towards strengthening the Bill and I certainly support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#TTT00400","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Senators van Turnhout and Zappone propose in amendment No. 6 to change the approach to capacity in section 3.  The Bill is based on the premise that a person has capacity unless otherwise determined.  We did not think it needed to be explicitly spelled out.  Legal capacity, as I previously indicated, is implicit.  I agree with most of what Senator Norris said, except that the amendment is necessary.  Section 8 provides for a series of important principles which require interventions to intrude as little as possible on a person&rsquo;s rights.  It also provides that the intervener must pay due regard to the person's will and preferences.  They are placed at the heart of the Bill.  In a situation where someone cannot clearly make a decision, it must be made by someone who has known the person, or can presume what the person's will and preference would have been in certain circumstances.<\/p> <p>The Bill is intended for a large potential target audience.  It includes a range of support options for people who have capacity difficulties but who can still exercise capacity.  It proposes the assisted decision-making option to support them in taking their own decisions.  The co-decision-making option has been moved out of the courts, and is a second option whereby the person can take decisions jointly.<\/p> <p>The Senators' intentions in their amendment are already encompassed in the architecture of the Bill.  However, the capacity test, which they propose to delete, is a vital part of that architecture.  If a person&rsquo;s right to the presumption of capacity is to be guaranteed, it follows that the appointment of a decision-making representative, an attorney or a designated health care representative can be undertaken only when the person has been found to lack capacity.  This is an essential point.  There has to be a solid legal basis if one person is taking decisions on behalf of another person.  We have had this discussion here on many issues in the past.  This cannot be done lightly.  I agree with the Senators that, as they say in their amendment, this is a situation of last resort.<\/p> <p>It is not feasible to limit the decisions needing to be taken on behalf of a person lacking capacity to those on which the person&rsquo;s will and preferences are known.  I will use the same example as I gave last week.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A man who is in a persistent vegetative state since the age of 20, for instance, may have expressed no views on the sale of a property that has come to him on the death of a family member.  There may be absolutely no way of ascertaining his will and preferences.  A similar set of circumstances may apply for some people with dementia.<\/p><p>The existing provisions strike the right balance between the assertion of the person&rsquo;s presumption of capacity and the decisions needing to be taken as a last resort when the person has lost capacity.  The capacity test is a key part of that process.  It has been refined to make clear that the test is time specific and issue specific.  This is essentially where we have gone further than anywhere else.  We do not expect people in these circumstances to have capacity across a range of areas; we are talking about particular decisions that need to be made in particular circumstances.  That is essential and a key component of this Bill.  It is about enabling people to make decisions for themselves on particular issues at a particular time.  That is considerably important but we cannot remove the capacity test and presume capacity when people may not have it in certain circumstances.  As the removal of the capacity test could create many unintended consequences, I cannot accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendments.  I hope my explanation rings true for her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#TTT00500","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":294,"content":"<p>This amendment basically recognises that everyone can have legal capacity, regardless of his or her decision-making ability, but that some may need support in that.

The Bill as published eased the criteria for legal aid by disapplying the merits test that currently applies in the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.  This provision ensures that the Legal Aid Board will not refuse legal aid just because it believes a case has no chance of success.<\/p> <p>Amendment 30 adds crucial new provisions.  It proposes to insert a new subsection 3A into section 28 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.  This will have the effect of ensuring that a relevant person who faces a court hearing to assess his or her capacity under Part 5 of the Bill will automatically qualify for legal representation regardless of his or her financial means.  This provision will ensure that a relevant person will have the right to legal representation from the Legal Aid Board where an application is made to the court concerning the person&rsquo;s capacity.<\/p> <p>The Legal Aid Board will assign a legal representative from a panel of specially qualified solicitors.  This is a crucial new provision that will significantly enhance the rights of a person with capacity difficulties in terms of access to legal representation when his or her capacity is at issue.  Amendment 29 is consequential on this proposal.<\/p> <p>The key objective is to ensure that a vulnerable person has quick and automatic access to legal representation to defend their interests when his or her capacity is in question.  This is what will be achieved by the provisions proposed.  However, some of the relevant persons who will benefit from the provisions will have considerable assets and means.  It is appropriate that they should pay for the cost of the service that is being provided to them if they have the necessary means.  Accordingly, it is proposed to insert a new subsection 7A into section 33 and a paragraph (fc) into section 37(2) of the 1995 Act to provide for the possibility of recoupment.<\/p> <p>These provisions will enable the Legal Aid Board to recoup its costs if the relevant person is over the income threshold.  However, even where the relevant person may subsequently have to pay for the costs of legal representation, that person will still benefit from access to the services of specially trained solicitors and from the fee limits imposed by the Legal Aid Board.  As a result, the person will have access to a specialist legal service for potentially lower costs than would apply if the person were to select legal representation independently.  Obviously, a person in this situation will continue to be able to use his or her own solicitor if he or she chooses.  There will be no obligation to use the services of the Legal Aid Board.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The final amendment proposes to insert a new paragraph (e) in the 1995 Act to transfer responsibility for legal representation of persons appearing at mental health tribunals from the Mental Health Commission to the Legal Aid Board.  Amendment No. 112 also proposes to insert a new section into the Mental Health Act 2001 to achieve this objective.  If these amendments are approved, the Legal Aid Board will assume responsibility for legal representation of those appearing at mental health tribunals.  As under the current arrangement, the Legal Aid Board will assign legal representation from a panel of specially qualified solicitors.  It is considered appropriate that the Legal Aid Board should take on this role because of its expertise in managing panels to provide legal representation for a range of legal aid schemes.  The same protections and rights will apply for persons appearing at mental health tribunals as under the current system operated by the Mental Health Commission. <\/p><p>While we are transferring the decision support services to the Mental Health Commission we are transferring the legal representation element to the Legal Aid Board which has been looked for as long as I can remember.  It is really necessary to move it into a more grounded and more appropriate space.  In this case we are talking about people whose capacity is being challenged or who have to appear before a tribunal in respect of their mental health.  It should not be the case that one is treated differently.  As I said before, this is a significant move.

Some guidance needs to be set out by which the board may seek to recover costs.  I am not necessarily suggesting the Bill be changed but recovery of costs should only be done if the interests of justice so demand.  For example, a person may not meet the criteria of financial hardship normally required to qualify for legal aid but if the board seeks to recover costs, this action might then financially cripple the relevant persons, especially if some of their main assets, such as the family home, would have to be mortgaged or sold to meet the retrospective costs of legal aid.

Those services will not necessarily be delivered by the service itself, however.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 31 to 33, inclusive, arise from the amendment proposed by Senators Cullinane, &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Reilly on Committee Stage.  Their amendment, as is set out in amendment No. 33, provides that a relative or friend of the appointer could make an application on behalf of an appointer for a review of the ward&rsquo;s case.  I promised to look into their proposal and to revert with an amendment if legally feasible.  This is a very technical and legal Bill.<\/p> <p>I am now proposing amendment No. 32, which follows that put forward by the Senators.  It provides that an application for a review of a ward&rsquo;s case could be made by a relative or friend of the ward who has had such personal contact with the ward that a relationship of trust exists between them.  There is one technical difference between the two amendments.  I know the Senators will understand this point.  My amendment describes the person who will be the subject of the application as a ward rather than as an appointer.  This is because the applications in this Part relate to wards.  The term \"appointer\" is used in the Bill only in relation to those appointing decision-making assistants or co-decision makers.  It is more correct to use the term \"ward\" for the purposes of Part 6 as the person whose case will be reviewed by the wardship court will always be a ward.  As I have now accommodated the Senators&rsquo; amendment, I would appreciate if they did not press their amendment.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 31 is consequential on the acceptance of amendment No. 32.  Amendment No. 34 is a technical amendment to include a reference to the wardship court&rsquo;s jurisdiction under section 22(2) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961.  The effect of the amendment is to provide for the wardship court to continue to have jurisdiction to enable payments to be made on behalf of wards on an interim basis, pending the review of their cases.  No change is envisaged to the policy of abolishing wardship for adult wards within the time limits already specified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#WWW02000","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her explanation.  We were moving the amendment because the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has stated in general comment No. 1 that \"[u]nder article 12 of the Convention, perceived or actual deficits in mental capacity must not be used as justification for denying legal capacity\".  Since this Bill is being developed as part of Ireland's preparation to ratify that convention, the functional assessment of mental capacity must be replaced by a process of interpreting the will and preferences of the individual.

These proposed amendments relate to the new enduring powers of attorney provisions that were inserted on Committee Stage.  They are mainly technical in nature, seeking to rectify typographical errors or to clarify the intent of the provision.  A number of them replace the term &ldquo;enduring power of attorney&rdquo; with the more correct term &ldquo;an instrument creating an enduring power of attorney&rdquo;.  The review of these provisions in preparation for Report Stage revealed the amendments needing to be made to the provisions already agreed.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 41 is a technical amendment.  It clarifies that the signatures of the witnesses to the creation of the enduring power are to be in the instrument that creates the enduring power and not within the enduring power itself.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 42 is a technical amendment that clarifies that the donor executes an instrument that creates an enduring power and not an enduring power.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 48, 55, 60 and 64 are technical amendments that clarify the intent of the provision.  Amendment No. 50 is a technical amendment that clarifies the intent of the provision.  The attorney must send a copy of the instrument that creates the enduring power and not just the enduring power itself to all those listed in subsection 3 of the new section 60 when he or she applies to register the instrument.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those being notified of the application to register an enduring power must have access to all the supporting documents, such as the statements from the medical professionals regarding the capacity of the donor, etc., that are necessary in order to create and register an enduring power.  This is to ensure they have all the relevant material in case they have any reservations or doubts about the validity of the power and wish to object to the registration and the coming into effect of the power.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 58 is a technical amendment that clarifies the intent of the subsection.  The director will establish and maintain a register of instruments creating an enduring power.  The instrument will include the enduring power and all the relevant back-up material such as the statements by the donor, the attorney and the various professionals regarding the capacity of the donor.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 59 is a technical amendment to provide that the director may send a copy of the instrument creating the enduring power, and not just the enduring power, to those who have a legitimate interest in obtaining a copy of the instrument.  Amendment No. 61 is a technical amendment to provide for the deletion of subsection (2) of the new section 66 which was inserted on Committee Stage by amendment No. 186.  The revised text takes into account that it is an instrument that creates an enduring power which is registered and not just the enduring power itself.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 62 inserts text into subsection (6) of the new section 67 which was inserted on Committee Stage by amendment No. 187.  New section 67 deals with the reporting obligations of attorneys.  The amendment provides that if an attorney fails to submit to the director a schedule of the donor&rsquo;s assets and liabilities and a projected statement of the donor&rsquo;s income and expenditure within three months of registration of the instrument creating the enduring power, or if he or she fails to keep proper accounts, the director must notify the attorney of his or her failure to comply and to give him or her time to comply or to submit a report.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 63 proposes the deletion of subsections (10) to (13), inclusive, in section 67 that were inserted by way of amendment No. 187 on Committee Stage.  The new section 67 expanded the reporting obligations of attorneys of enduring powers, especially in relation to financial affairs, and it applied those obligations to attorneys of enduring powers that have been created under the 1996 Act but have not yet been registered.  When I submitted amendment No. 187 on Committee Stage, I thought it was possible to include attorneys appointed in an enduring power created under the 1996 Act but not yet registered.  However, I have received legal advice which sets out that imposing the new reporting obligations on attorneys who were appointed under a different law could carry constitutional risks.<\/p><p>In many cases the new reporting obligations will become apparent to the attorney only when the donor has lost capacity and when the attorney applies to register the power.  There is a risk that an attorney might decline to take on the additional reporting obligations and might disclaim the enduring power, leaving a vulnerable person without the support of the attorney whom he or she had specifically chosen to take decisions on his or her behalf.  Equally, it is not possible retrospectively to require a spouse, appointed as an attorney under the 1996 Act, to comply with reporting requirements that might involve reporting on his or her own assets and property.  It should have been obvious, but it was not.  While we may not be able to impose the new reporting obligations on the attorneys appointed under the 1996 Act, the new complaints mechanism in relation to attorneys will apply to all attorneys.  The complaints mechanism will apply to those appointed under the provisions of the Bill and those appointed under the 1996 Act.  This will be an important protection for all donors.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 65 is a technical amendment which clarifies that it is the instrument which is registered and not the enduring power.  Amendment No. 68 is a technical amendment to insert additional matters that must be prescribed by the Minister.  These were inadvertently omitted on Committee Stage.  Amendment No. 69 is a technical amendment to correct an incorrect cross reference and is a consequence of amendment No. 63.  Amendment No. 70 is a technical amendment to add a cross reference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#WWW04800","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1450179000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Amendment

While the Bill is bringing a significant group advance in the advance health care directives, those who are involuntarily detained and treated under the Mental Health Act 2001, approximately 10%, will not be included.  Each individual is significant.  As I outlined on Committee Stage, all the research tells us that it is not about people refusing treatment but about their preferences being backed up.  It is at this precise moment that it is needed.<\/p><p>I am also very aware of the difficulties regarding the Mental Health Act, which is under review, and how we need to recalibrate and re-engineer it.  I am very torn.  While I am a pragmatic person, I am very concerned that we are leaving people behind in an approach that must be welcomed.  While we can discuss the legislation up and down in the Houses, the practice and resourcing on the ground may not change.  Will the professionals take a human rights approach centred on dignity, wills, preferences and listening in the different ways many of my colleagues have outlined?  While we can have all the best and most precise legislation, will it make the difference we all want to believe in?  Many of my colleagues in the Seanad have personally invested in trying to make this what it should be, as has the Minister of State.<\/p><p>Will the funding and resources be given to approaches that respect human rights, dignity and the will and preferences of the individual?  I particularly cite open dialogue for those in acute distress, psychosis and mania, which is being used by Dr. Pat Bracken of the HSE in west Cork.  In the UK, the NHS provides a three-year training programme in the open dialogue approach along with the Hearing Voices Network.  We have not necessarily seen the engagement on the ground.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have seen some brilliant practice and some not so brilliant, to put it in the politest terms, since I am not allowed to use unparliamentary language and there are certain words I would like to use regarding that practice.

I cannot say it is a head and heart decision because my head as well as my heart is torn on this matter, but I am also pragmatic.  While this Bill will make a difference, I believe we are leaving some people outside the room, so to speak, and I am not happy about that, nor do I agree with it.  I want a clear commitment from the Minister of State that in revising the Mental Health Act, those people who involuntarily undergo treatment will not be excluded and that if any amendments are needed to the legislation under discussion, this would be done in a timely way.  Perhaps the Minister of State would outline how that could be done.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State clarify whether a person who fails the functional test will not be able to make a valid assessment agreement?

This mirrors a debate held on Committee Stage about advance health care directives being legally binding.  I will not repeat all the comments but a strong argument was put forward and some of the organisations represented in the Visitors Gallery tonight are still calling for that.  Senators have been contacted again by those groups in light of that debate on Committee Stage.  I have been sent a copy of a petition from the Critical Voices Network of Ireland, a service user advocacy network, with 345 signatures and comments from health service users and other interested parties on the advance health care directive amendment.  That is still on the table and the service users have not been assuaged by the comments made.  They say the Minister of State is putting through the Bill to remove section 59 and 60 provisions where a person is unwilling to consent to ECT and medication under the Mental Health Act, so they see no clear reason this cannot be done for people who, under the Mental Health Act, are found incapable of consenting.  The call is still there and I am making one last gasp attempt to get the Minister of State to take it on board.  She has accommodated many other changes, which is appreciated.  This one is ongoing.<\/p> <p>I also support the call by Senator van Turnhout for open dialogue and other methods being advocated.

It is important to say this.  The capacity legislation covers everyone, including people who have mental health difficulties and advance health care directives.  The legislation goes further because most countries do not include people with mental health difficulties in capacity legislation.  There are two small exceptions which are very understandable.  One is when a person is subject to a conditional discharge from the Central Mental Hospital.  I was involved in the legislation when it went through under the previous Government.  It allows people limited conditional discharge from the Central Mental Hospital, which is right and proper.  I have always had an interest in mental health, and the fine detail and more severe end is sometimes lost in the debate.  However, if the person on conditional discharge decided through an advance health care directive that he or she did not want to continue with their medication regime while outside of the institution, clearly that conditional discharge would be revoked and they would be brought back in.  It is all dependent on the person complying with their medication regime.  They could be hearing voices, and I know people who hear voices and I have a good relationship with some such people.  I sometimes think those voices are probably more informed than the rest of us.  However, I understand, as do they, that there are times when these people must have their needs protected more than anything else.<\/p> <p>The other exception is for people who are detained involuntarily.  Everyone is covered under this legislation regarding advance health care directives, whether it involves mental health, acquired brain injury, disability and so on.  There are just those two small exceptions.  The exception of the person who is detained involuntarily will be dealt with in the Mental Health Act.  I have had a discussion on this with people in this area whom I trust and who would not be conservative in their thinking.  We cannot knowingly put a section into this legislation that contradicts section 4 of the Mental Health Act.  However, this will be dealt with in the new Mental Health Bill.  When I consulted Mr. Brendan Kenny, whom I trust very much on this matter, he agreed that advance health care directives under the Mental Health Act must be legally binding, but in the event of imminent, serious harm or the possibility of such, the consultant would have to overrule that advance health care directive.  However, he or she would have to explain the decision before a tribunal or before the courts.  Mr. Kenny explained that this is done all the time.<\/p> <p>It is not an impossible task but we cannot do it in this legislation.  If this Bill requires amending as a result of the new Mental Health Bill, which will involve 165 amendments, that will not be a problem and it will happen.  This is not a principled exclusion.  It is merely a practical method of doing it.  I do not very often slap myself on the back, but if anyone thinks for one minute that I want to exclude people just because they have a mental health difficulty, they really do not know me.  This is something we are going to do but we cannot do it in this legislation.  In the event that we need to amend this legislation as a result of the new Mental Health Bill, that will happen.  I hope that gives some degree of comfort to people.  I understand that people want it to be included but it is possible to amend the Bill in the event that the Mental Health Bill contradicts it.  There is a question about whether there should be mental health legislation at all, but that is a different story.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#YYY00400","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for clarifying that.

It took almost the lifetime of the Government.  That simply shows us how important the legislation is.  My comments on perfection earlier were rebutted by one of my colleagues.  Anyway, perfection was not achieved by the great Greek and Roman civilisations in practically anything they did.  I do not think politics can ever achieve perfection.  All we can do is strive to ensure we leave society and the processes within society in a better place than we found them.<\/p> <p>We should strive to ensure our country, nation, democracy, people and citizens, including vulnerable citizens, who are all citizens, ultimately, have a better deal than when we came to this House first.  Certainly, in terms of this legislation, we have gone a long way to achieving that.  Perhaps it is not perfection but we will get there.  I hope the people who come after us in this Parliament can improve it to ensure their legacy will be far better.<\/p> <p>I wish to acknowledge the non-governmental organisations.  Many representatives from these organisations are in the Gallery and many are looking in on television and the Internet.  If it was not for NGOs and the vital role they play in society, I do not think we would be as advanced as we are today.<\/p> <p>I had the great privilege of officially opening a centre of excellence in the University of Limerick for equipping and offering continuous professional development to NGOs and people working within NGOs to ensure the level of professionalism that exists today in those organisations improves and increases.  This will ensure they are among the most professional NGOs in the world.  The commitment is in place and I firmly believe that as we move forward we will have a great little nation for people who are vulnerable.  That is all we can achieve.<\/p> <p>I wish to pay tribute to Carol Baxter, her colleague and the other officials in the Department.  Often their work is not appreciated but it is important for parliamentarians to acknowledge their work.  If they did not prepare or deal with the various nuggets that cropped up, as well as the conflicts in the legislation and so forth, then the Minister of State would not have been properly advised and, in turn, those of us in Parliament would not have been advised either.<\/p> <p>It is a tribute to all Senators across the board that we have not divided on this Bill.  It is not perfect but it is a significant step forward.  It may not be a giant step for man, as someone said once in space, but it is a significant step for the people who really need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#AAAA00200","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I would like to be associated with the remarks of Senator Conway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#AAAA00300","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":562,"content":"<p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh is next, without interruption, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#AAAA00400","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":563,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom aont&uacute; leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite roimhe seo.

This is a wonderful day.  It is a proud day for everyone in the House.  We have to remember that the most important people are the service users and their families.  They are the heroes today, in fairness.  Other people have played a part as well.<\/p> <p>It has been a good example of democracy in action.  All of us are aware that we have been lobbied, tweeted about and received messages from people who are very passionate about this topic.  It is important that some of them are in the Gallery.  It is great to see people in the Gallery sitting through a debate and listening to all that is being discussed.  They have been nudging us a little further to do what we need to do with the amendments, etc.<\/p> <p>The hashtag #creditwherecreditisdue was used last week and I wish to give the Minister of State credit.  It is important that we do so.  My colleagues in the Seanad will be aware that I am very critical of Ministers who I do not agree with.  However, it is important that we give credit where credit is due today.  If we did not have the political will from the Minister of State and her staff to bring in the amendments and take them on board, it would not have happened.<\/p> <p>We will come back to other issues - the Minister of State has noted as much.  That is for another day.  Today is a day to be grateful that this legislation is going to be put through.  It will make the lives of the service users, their families and all those in need of these services better in future.  Who knows whether we could be in that category ourselves at some stage?  It is important that this legislation is passed.

It is a proud and historic day.  It is also an emotional day for all the people involved.  Like my colleagues, I am keen to commend the Minister of State on all her hard work.  I know of the numerous discussions that she and her expert advisers have held.  Not only have they sat through five hours of debates in one sitting as well as God knows how many hours elsewhere but they have been very communicative with information and advice on the part of the Department.  I thank the officials for that.<\/p> <p>It is not perfect and I know some people will be unhappy.  However, as we have said, it is a major step forward.  It is also a great sign that we are acknowledging that there is work to do on both sides when it comes to examining the mental health Bill.  Any day spent working on our legislation when we can remove words like \"lunatic\" and \"imbecile\" from our legislation is a proud day.<\/p> <p>It is also a great day for the Seanad.  It is a day when we should all stand up and thank God the Taoiseach did not have his way and have the House abolished.  It is also a great day because an early election was not called.  That was a serious concern of mine - I said as much publicly.  One thing many of us were focused on was getting this legislation through and I am delighted that this day has come.<\/p> <p>Without singling people out, I know there are people in the Gallery who have sat through the Bill.  I wish to thank Inclusion Ireland.  I do not wish to name names, but I thank everyone in the Gallery.  There are many others I wish to thank as well.  I will conclude by referring to the self-advocacy group in Inclusion Ireland.  I saw a video made by one of the advocates, Adrian, last week.  I know he has tweeted and told me that he is watching this, as are many people who will be affected by this legislation.  We have seen the videos people have put up and we know what this Bill means to them.  It is a great day for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#AAAA00600","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":565,"content":"<p>My last interruption was not an interruption.  It was simply to agree with everything Senator Conway said, rather than repeat it, in deference to the people who have been sitting in the Gallery for hours.  I congratulate the Minister of State for a job well done.

It has been a long time on the go.  It is four years since we came to the Houses with it.  Not only that, there have been two years of continuous consultation.  I know they get embarrassed, but do Senators know how great these officials are?  After five hours last week, they came out and said to me that the debate was very interesting.  I know that was not what they were thinking, but they still said it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They would still say it.  They are exceptional people, and sometimes we forget that they were the ones who held consultations and produced what we have passed.  It bears no resemblance to the Bill as first published.  The Title, contents and argument have changed.  As people have said, things will change into the future.  Surely the essence of what we are is that we will continue to learn, realise what we do, and do not do, well and what we should, and should not do, more of.<\/p><p>The first time this issue came to my attention was through Inclusion Ireland, represented by Jean Spain and Deirdre Carroll.  I cannot but commend Patricia Rickard-Clarke on her exceptional work.  She promoted the Bill constantly and explained its purpose, consequences and all the rest.<\/p><p>I met a young woman with mobility problems who used a wheelchair.  She explained to me that when her family was given respite, she went into a nursing home.  She asked me why she should have to leave her family home.  That is the essential point of the Bill.  Individuals have the right to make different decisions themselves, not for others.  Why could that young woman not say she would prefer to stay at home with support rather than having to leave what she is familiar with?  That type of experience tells us we must do better.  <\/p><p>I am straying into the area of report cards and all the rest, but we must do better and be more open.  We must be like sponges, that is, open to the suggestions made by others.  I only object to something when I am absolutely convinced that something is not the right thing to do at a particular time - it may be the right thing to do next year.  The question is often posed as to when one should change one's mind, and the answer is when the evidence changes.  That should be the position for everyone. <\/p><p>Before work on the Bill commenced, I referred to it as the \"Does he take sugar legislation?\".  The phrase implies that a person with a mobility, disability or intellectual disability could not speak for himself or herself or engage with others.  The Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act, the Marriage of Lunatics Act and other legislation will be repealed.  I am sure such terms were perfectly normal at one time, but times change, things move on and we do different things.  Our attitudes to others and society change.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and I will never agree about economics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121500002#AAAA01000","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450179000,"counter":570,"content":"<p>We might.

I do not think any party or individual is different in that regard. <\/p> <p>This is a very historic day for all of us.  When I discuss how we age, I always say that I do not intend to get old, rather, I just intend to keep on living.  When the time comes, I want to be asked what I want to do, in terms of whether I want to remain living in the same place or need to move.  I want my answer to be respected.  The central elements of the Bill are respect, dignity and kindness. <\/p> <p>I thank those in the Gallery, those outside of it and Members of the Seanad and D&aacute;il for their contributions.  We have taken them on board.  The Bill was always about being open.  The changes we will have to make in the future will be very important.  We can be proud of ourselves in terms of the Bill and other legislation, such as the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill which will be debated on Thursday.
