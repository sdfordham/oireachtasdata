Last night we were glad to sit because we had to.  Sometimes emergency legislation is required and last night was one of those occasions.  For Senator Mary White to compare last night to the fateful night in 2008 is irresponsible, inaccurate and wholly laughable.  As she and her colleagues know, large problems were inherited from the previous Administration.  The Government is on an ongoing mission to restore Irish sovereignty and sort out the problems with the banks.  Lately, we have been accused of mentioning the promissory note problem too often by those who said three months ago that we did not mention it enough.  As with many others, I am hopeful the head of the European Central Bank, Mr. Draghi, will make an announcement this afternoon on a favourable deal for Ireland.  However, if that deal does not emerge today, I will not lose my patience because I know that these deals are intricate, complex and require much thought and consideration if they are to be got right.  If there were no such deliberation, we would complain.  If there is no deal today, I will be confident thatonel will be struck in the middle of next week.  The Taoiseach is in Brussels today with the Heads of State negotiating the new EU budget.  He is trying to reach agreement on a budget of nearly \u20ac1 trillion.  He hopes the deal will be struck by the weekend.  One will agree, therefore, that there is quite a lot of pressure on the system.<\/p><p>As a Member of the Seanad, I was very proud to have been present yesterday at the launch of the public consultation committee's report on cancer.

I was delighted to welcome yesterday representatives of the National Cancer Control Programme, the Irish Cancer Society and many other organisations which took part in the consultation process.  They welcomed the short but accurate and complete report that we had presented.  We will be giving it to the Minister and I look forward to his being present to debate it.

I ask that the parliamentary tradition be included with the others we are to honour.  There is a very fine section on the Irish Parliamentary Party in Dr. Maurice Manning's chapter in the book <i>The Houses of the Oireachtas<\/i>.  The facts about the party are simple enough, he states.  For 40 years it was the voice of nationalist Ireland.  It articulated its demands and argued its case in the one place where change was possible to achieve and it achieved much.  It created the world's first pledge-bound, mass-based disciplined political party.  It forced a rewriting of the rules of the House of Commons, held the balance of power at critical moments, put the Irish question on top of the political agenda and, among other achievements, delivered a series of reforms that resulted in the end of landlordism.  There is a terrific tradition that is sometimes forgotten about in other aspects of Irish history.  We, as parliamentarians, should organise some event to celebrate that splendid parliamentary tradition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700003#B01500","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1360238400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700003#B01600","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1360238400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>We certainly had interesting political drama in Leinster House yesterday and the proceedings continued long into the night.  Senator Mary White referred to the long session on 30 September 2008.  On that night, perhaps through nobody's fault or everybody's, we entered a very long tunnel of economic despair.  Let us hope last night's late sitting in the Houses will be the beginning of the exit from that dark tunnel.  There is much work still to be done and the Government continues to negotiate.  We wish all our negotiators well in these crucial days.  We can, at least, look forward with some optimism on behalf of the people.  We must congratulate everybody concerned.  A united national effort is required.  Had we known in 2008 what we now know, different decisions might have been made.  However, most people entered into the spirit of national co-operation and we must expect and demand the same of all our political colleagues now.<\/p><p>Let me refer to what Senator Sean D. Barrett said about the Irish Parliamentary Party.  His contribution was excellent and on a subject in which the Leader has a great interest.  We should have an opportunity in this House to reflect further on it.  That leads me to a point I have wished to make, despite the economic agenda having very much taken over.<\/p> <p>It would be helpful if we had a debate on Northern Ireland in the next few weeks.  Fortunately, the need the Seanad had ten or 15 years ago for almost weekly or monthly debates to discuss tragedies in Northern Ireland has passed, but there are still significant problems in the northern part of this country, from a political perspective, on which we need to reflect.  Senators have different views on, and analysis of, the issue.  I do not recall a debate on Northern Ireland in this Seanad and it would be helpful if we could set aside a few hours because, without abusing the term, all of the problems have not gone away and we still must play a part in the ongoing political dialogue between this House, Northern Ireland and London.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700003#B01700","speaker":"1121","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360239000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I will not rehash what happened last night.  In one sense, we have taken a leap of faith and put our trust in the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to negotiate and deliver the best possible deal for this nation.<\/p><p>We should ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, to come to the House for an urgent debate on CAP reform.  The negotiation on the EU budget today is of huge importance to this country but we should not forget that almost 25% of those elected to the Seanad are elected through the agricultural panel.  We must keep agriculture and the agrifood industry foremost in our minds.  The current provision for the single farm payment is \u20ac1.7 billion and I urge, in so far as possible, that this figure is retained to ensure the survival of the farming sector, which is the backbone of our economic recovery.  I wish the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and all those involved in the negotiations every success.  It is proper and fitting that we all wear the green jersey on these occasions.  In negotiations on CAP reform and on the Common Fisheries Policy, I would always wish our Minister the best in fighting for the best deal possible for the farmers and fishermen of this country.  However, I sound a note of warning that if the single farm payment, worth \u20ac1.7 billion to this country, is in any way diluted or if Ireland is asked to contribute more than the back-up funding of one euro for one euro, there will be protests from farming organisations.  The Irish Farmers Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association are really depending on the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to deliver.  While I wish him well, I shudder to think what would happen if the deal for the farming organisations, this country and the farmers is less than we expect it to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700004#C00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1360239000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>There is a certain sense of <i>d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu<\/i> for many of us in that we were here not so many hours ago debating the emergency legislation to liquidate what was Anglo Irish Bank.

I asked them what we could do to help and it was very clear he was giving me a list of two or three things.  One of the points he made was that there has been a very substantial drop in the number of organ donations in the past year.  It is not impossible for us to do some things.  We should ensure we have trained advisers to approach people if someone close to them has died.  There was a case during the week in which a woman's son died and she was able to say his organs had given new life to at least four people.  We have reduced the number of co-ordinators - I do not particularly like that word - for organ transplants and it is possible to do something about this.<\/p><p>An article in the newspaper yesterday stated that Northern Ireland proposed to introduce presumed consent but in the Republic it is not acceptable to approach the parents of somebody who has died to make that suggestion.

What plans could have been or should have been put in place for the staff who are not going to be taken on by a liquidator who will not have the same salaries and conditions?  They are a concern.<\/p><p>Underlying all of that is a concern about the deal.  Promissory notes and special purpose vehicles are from Mars when compared with what the people are interested in.  They want to know what will help them pay their child care bills and decrease their mortgage arrears.  We need a deal that is tangible.  Once upon a time I held a different view but that has evolved as it should as we learn more.  A write-down is essential in a European context.  Last night I said briefly that Europe and the ECB have manipulated a process, whether it is Germany, France or the super powers, to politically appease their own nations and suit themselves and use Ireland as a pawn.  As the Spanish crisis grows they will be forced to act and I hope for that in earnest.  We all support the Minister for Finance and all efforts to secure a good deal today but it must involve a write-down.<\/p><p>I shall turn to another issue and I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.  Next Tuesday the hospitals groupings will be announced which is a critically important issue for the region concerned.  The report is being prepared by Mr. John Higgins and he will recommend that the Sligo Regional Hospital and Letterkenny Hospital will be grouped with University College Hospital Galway.  We appreciate that those areas need to be directly linked with a tertiary hospital for certain expertise.  Mr. Higgins will acknowledge in his report that there is a unique geographic situation at work in the north-west region.  We may need to establish a group within the group with its own governance structure for Letterkenny and Sligo, in particular.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate immediately after the report is made available on Tuesday because it is vitally important.  Unlike the clinical programmes such as cancer services and changes in cardiology, we do not need to make the same mistake, that is shutting down the north-west region.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700005#D04400","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1360239600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Last night we did not have an ideal amount of time yet we still had quality and discussion with the Minister were informative.

It strikes me - not to mention the <i>ultra vires<\/i> point made by Senator Barrett last night - that this makes the Bill highly susceptible to a constitutional challenge.  If the Bill is successfully challenged, the risk exposure to the bondholders then becomes very focused and a reality for us.<\/p><p>  Has the liquidator appointed to this company any connection as auditor or consultant to any of the failed financial institutions?  It would be regrettable if the Leader answered in the positive, which I suspect he may have to do.<\/p><p>  Last night we copperfastened bank debt as sovereign debt.  It was said last summer at IMF and EU level that the need to separate bank debt from sovereign debt was essential if countries were to recover.  We have gone in the opposite direction in that, as I perceive it, that cannot happen.  I was seriously concerned last night when a Government Member, whom I will not embarrass by naming him, said this was about alleviating difficult political decisions.  This could be the purpose of the Bill.  I understand there will be a saving of a couple of billion euro a year in interest rates as we pile the debt out and transfer it to our grandchildren and to future generations.  It is not a responsible action for us to take.  It is certainly not one I will subscribe to in the future, and I hope my party will not subscribe to it either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700006#E01500","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1360240200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Emergency legislation was brought before the House last night but I was pleased to hear the Minister, Deputy Noonan, clarify that the drafting of the legislation was not an emergency measure; it had been in place for months.

I suggest we work one late session or one early morning session once a week until we face up to that difficult issue in the health service.  I refer to a matter raised by Senator Feargal Quinn, that is, organ donation.  Senator John Crown appeared with a number of others before the Joint Committee on Health at 9.30 a.m.  That is an indication of the endurance one has to learn to have as a doctor.  An issue that has arisen in respect of organ donation is that there are a number of organisations trying to promote it, but there is no co-ordination between the HSE and the Department of Health on the matter.  This raises an issue which I raised recently in an Adjournment debate about the Department of Health which meets groups individually but is not meeting all groups involved in a particular issue together.   For example, in regard to elderly care, it will meet representatives of the nursing homes on their own, representatives of the HSE on their own and representatives of HIQA on their own, but no co-ordination is taking place within the health care sector.  We need an urgent debate with the Minister on the co-ordination of services within the health care sector involving the HSE, the Department of Health, HIQA, health care providers and all those who work in the system as delivery is unorganised and disjointed.  That matter was raised at the Joint Committee on Health this morning, with reference to the issues raised by Senators Feargal Quinn and Martin Conway.

The Bill also provides for other amendments to the functions of the foundation, including the refocusing of the research themes to be funded by it, covering both oriented basic research and applied research, towards areas that have the greatest potential to deliver a sustainable economic return through enterprise development, employment creation and quality of life.<\/p><p>The Bill provides for certain amendments to existing legislation relating to Forf\u00e1s, Shannon Development and Enterprise Ireland.  These are unrelated to the proposed changes to the remit of Science Foundation Ireland but are included as they are all within the framework of the Industrial Development Acts.  The amendment relating to Shannon Development is a necessary one to the Industrial Development Acts to provide for new arrangements for the promotion of enterprise opportunities in the mid-west region.<\/p> <p>Before I describe the provisions of the Bill in more detail, I propose to outline the background to Science Foundation Ireland, its role in the national research and innovation system and the broader role of research and innovation in the overall strategy for economic recovery and growth.  I will also outline the rationale for the changes proposed in the Bill and their contribution to this strategy.<\/p><p>Science Foundation Ireland was established under the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Act 2003.  Under that Act, the main function of the foundation is to &quot;promote, develop and assist the carrying out of oriented basic research in strategic areas of scientific endeavour that concerns the future development and competitiveness of industry and enterprise in the State&quot;.  The Act specified information and communication technologies and biotechnology as &quot;strategic areas of scientific endeavour&quot;.  Sustainable energy and energy-efficient technologies were subsequently specified, by means of regulations, as comprising an additional strategic area of scientific endeavour.  Science Foundation Ireland provides grants to researchers and research groups that are based in higher education institutions on the basis of competitive calls for proposals with selection on the basis of international peer review.  The foundation's funding programmes support research teams led by principal investigators, the clustering of research teams with industry engagement and larger-scale groups of research teams to address a more limited number of strategic thematic areas in collaboration with industry partners.<\/p><p>The preparation of this legislation provides the opportunity to remind ourselves of and articulate the reasons the Government funds research and development.  It is accepted internationally that the private sector does not fund research and development at the optimum level for economic and societal benefit.  The reasons for this include the fact that research and development, particularly basic research, is inherently risky.  The commercial returns are often insufficiently clear for the private investor.  Another reason is that the societal returns from investment in research and development sometimes outweigh the direct returns to the private investor.  If the private investor does not capture all of the returns generated from the investment, this may act as a disincentive for the private sector.  These reasons apply in Ireland as they do elsewhere.  It could be argued that Ireland, as a small, open economy, can take advantage of discoveries made elsewhere and avoid significant investment in research and development, particularly basic research.  However, if we are to absorb and take advantage of externally generated new knowledge, we must have the capability to understand and use it.  Therefore, our economy must conduct research and development itself.  As the global economy and society are constantly changing and developing, there is an ongoing need to address societal, environmental and economic challenges.  If Ireland is to maintain and enhance its position in the global economy, our economy needs to keep pace.  Our past and current economic successes provide no guarantee of success in the future.  Therefore, we must continue to invest appropriately in creation and innovation if we are to be able to compete in the global marketplace.<\/p><p>There has been significant public investment in science, technology and innovation in Ireland since the late 1990s.  This was initiated from a low base.  Before then, Ireland had not invested significantly in research and development and our international ranking for quality of scientific research was well below OECD standards, on a par with some Third World countries.  The lack of high-quality research personnel performing industrially relevant research was deemed to be an impediment to attracting large-scale knowledge-intensive industrial projects to Ireland and to developing indigenous internationally competitive, high-growth firms.  While the Irish economy had grown substantially during the 1990s, with substantial employment growth and improvements in prosperity, there was a concern in the late 1990s that Ireland was no longer a low-wage economy.  The movement of manufacturing to lower-cost economies was evident.  It was clear that Ireland had to make the transition to higher-added-value products and services that allowed us to sustain and increase incomes.  A key part of this process involved recognising the importance of knowledge creation and innovation in sustaining and enhancing competitiveness.  National policy was developed to focus on building new sources of competitive advantage with a view to sustaining growth and jobs over the longer term.  This involved repositioning Irish enterprise higher in the value chain, thereby requiring more highly skilled and knowledge-based employment.  The key to Ireland's continued success was to ensure the enterprise development agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, successfully promoted the establishment and development of firms with a competitive advantage based on knowledge, technology, innovation and related skills rather than on maintaining traditional activities and approaches.<\/p><p>In 1998, the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation undertook a technology foresight initiative, which sought to identify emerging technologies that would be central to national economic development in future years.  The report of the initiative recommended that the Government establish a fund to enable Ireland to become a centre for world-class research excellence in strategically important areas such as ICT and biotechnology and their underlying sciences.  The Government accepted this recommendation and subsequently established Science Foundation Ireland to administer this fund.  Science Foundation Ireland's investments in human capital in strategic areas of scientific endeavour are complemented by investments under the programme for research in third level institutions, which is administered by the Higher Education Authority.  This investment is aimed at developing high-quality research capabilities in higher education institutions, including research buildings, facilities and equipment.  This public investment has had a significant impact over the past decade or more.  The human capital, infrastructure and systems that have been developed from this investment are feeding through to attract foreign direct investment and commercialisation.  In 2012, more than 40% of IDA Ireland's job announcements related to companies with links to Science Foundation Ireland research teams.  Such companies accounted for 4,575 of the new IDA Ireland client-win jobs that were announced last year.  The researchers and research teams that are supported by Science Foundation Ireland are connected to more than 600 companies employing more than 90,000 people in this country.<\/p><p>Ireland is ranked 20th globally in terms of our research capability.  This represents an improvement on our ranking of 36th in 2003.  We are performing very well in specific fields.  We are ranked third in the world for immunology research, which is a key area of relevance to the life sciences sector.  We are ranked sixth in nanotechnology and eighth in materials science, both of which are key to Ireland's life sciences, ICT and energy sectors.  These high standings result largely from the excellent research carried out by various teams that are funded by Science Foundation Ireland.  Such global rankings are seen as a key element in the attraction of Ireland for these sectors as a location for foreign direct investment.  The impact of our research investment can be seen in the figures for research and development expenditure by the business sector.  Expenditure on research and development by the business sector trebled from \u20ac600 million to \u20ac1.8 billion between 1997 and 2010.  In 2004, less than 10% of IDA Ireland's investment wins were in research, development and innovation projects.  They were worth \u20ac120 million.  We have seen an almost sixfold increase in this regard, to the point at which the comparable figure for 2011 was \u20ac700 million.  This national investment is also paying off for indigenous firms.  The exports, employment and sustainability figures of research and development-performing firms consistently outperform those of firms that do not engage in research and development.<\/p><p>The areas around which public investment has been oriented to date were appropriate for building a broad base of capacity and expertise in strategic areas underpinning science and technology.  Ireland is now looking to build on the strengths that have emerged from the investment to date in science, technology and innovation and to target future investment in areas that link directly to current and likely future economic and societal needs.  It is appropriate for Ireland to define more precisely the areas where critical mass and concentration of effort will maximise returns.<\/p> <p>As a small country which is very dependent on the global market, it makes strategic sense that we should, to a significant but not exclusive extent, focus on those areas of research with the greatest potential for development of applications to generate economic growth and address problems in our society.  In addition, given the harsh realities of our current fiscal and economic crisis, there are competing and equally compelling demands for Exchequer investment and we need to ensure now, more than ever, that we achieve the optimum impact from our investment.<\/p><p>In 2010 a high-level Government-appointed steering group, chaired by Mr. Jim O'Hara, formerly of Intel, was established to identify priority areas of focus for Irish research for the future.  This exercise was comprehensive, involving extensive research, analysis and stakeholder consultation.  The report of the group was approved by Government in February 2012.  The group identified 14 priority areas of opportunity for Ireland and six underpinning technologies and infrastructure to support these priority areas, on the basis of existing strengths of the enterprise base, opportunities that exist in terms of the global marketplace and those which are most likely to deliver economic and societal impact, and, ultimately, jobs.  The aim is to align the majority of public science, technology and innovation, STI, investment with the 14 areas of opportunity identified in the report, as well as the underpinning technologies and infrastructure.  The report also acknowledged the important role of research for policy and research for knowledge, and recommended that the remaining funding be channelled to support these two areas.  A number of measures were also recommended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the STI system.<\/p><p>It is in this context that the Bill provides for the refocusing of the research themes to be funded by Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, towards the priority areas of opportunity.  In the context of considering how to accelerate the impact of public investment in research, the question arises as to whether we have the mechanisms in place to maximise the opportunities arising from the research funded by SFI and which is carried out in our higher education institutions.  Currently, SFI's remit is to carry out &quot;oriented basic research in strategic areas of scientific endeavour&quot;.  The definition of oriented basic research in the 2003 Act which established SFI follows an internationally recognised categorisation as set out in an OECD publication known as the Frascati manual.  It is defined as research that is &quot;carried out with the expectation that it will produce a broad base of knowledge likely to form the basis of the solution to recognised or expected, current or future problems or possibilities&quot;.  In other words, this research is expected to produce results that form the basis for future applications.  Applied research means &quot;work undertaken in order to gain scientific or technical knowledge and directed towards a specific practical application&quot;.  Applied research is usually undertaken either to determine possible uses for the findings of basic research or to determine new methods or ways of creating practical applications.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland administers several programmes involving direct grants to companies to develop and support industry-led, market-focused applied research.  However, these programmes still leave a gap in pursuing applied research opportunities arising from oriented basic research.  The programmes operated by Enterprise Ireland start at a stage further from where many researchers find themselves as the possible uses for the basic research results have not yet been explored.  Consequently, the proposed addition to the SFI remit is intended to fill this gap.  The extension of SFI's remit to include applied research will take the outcome of oriented basic research funded by SFI closer to market, which in turn increases the potential of research to yield commercial opportunities and jobs, as well as other societal benefits.<\/p><p>The Bill also includes a new function to enable SFI to promote and support awareness and understanding of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation transferred responsibility for delivery of the Discover Science and Engineering programme from Forf\u00e1s to SFI on an administrative basis with effect from 1 March 2012.<\/p><p>Since its establishment in 2003, the Discover Science and Engineering programme has been actively working with companies and higher education institutions, as well as representative bodies such as Engineers Ireland to heighten the awareness of science and engineering and to raise the level of student uptake of the physical sciences at second and third level.  The objective of Discover Science and Engineering is to promote awareness and understanding of the importance of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, to increase the number of students studying the physical sciences and mathematics, to promote a positive attitude to careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and to foster a greater public understanding of the physical sciences, engineering and mathematics and their value to Irish society.<\/p><p>There are many synergies and mutual complementarities between Discover Science and Engineering and SFI, particularly in light of the outreach programmes run through the SFI-funded research centres.  This transfer enables synergies between the Discover Science and Engineering programme and SFI funding to be maximised and will increase the impact of this programme.  The Bill provides power for SFI to provide funding to research groups based in Northern Ireland and also to enable participation by SFI in international funding programmes.  SFI does not currently have the power to fund research groups outside the State.<\/p><p>In regard to Northern Ireland, the Bill enables SFI to provide funding to research groups in Northern Ireland under an existing scheme, known as the Charles Parsons energy research awards.  The Bill also enables SFI to provide funding to research groups in Northern Ireland where they are in partnership with institutions or companies based in the State for the purposes of the research.  Following the extension of SFI's remit to sustainable energy and energy-efficient technologies in 2008, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources agreed in 2008 that responsibility for the Charles Parsons energy research awards scheme would transfer to the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with management of the awards undertaken by SFI.  This transfer was completed in November 2009.<\/p><p>Under this scheme, seven research groups were awarded grant aid by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in December 2006.  Two of the awards were made to groups based in Northern Ireland institutions, namely Queen's University, Belfast and the University of Ulster.  While responsibility for the management of all of the awards has been transferred to SFI, for the time being, any payments to the Northern Ireland institutions are made by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Subject to performance under the terms of the award, the final payments are due to be made to the awardees in 2013.  This change will enable SFI to fund these awards directly, as is already the case regarding the awardees based in the State.<\/p><p>The more general power for SFI to fund research groups in Northern Ireland will enhance opportunities for collaboration between research groups both North and South.  To leverage best value from Ireland's research investment it is proposed to enable SFI, subject to the consent of the Minister, to enter cost-share arrangements with international partners in areas linked to its mandated priority areas and where Irish researchers have real potential to achieve added value from such arrangements.  It is important for Ireland, through SFI, to be ready to participate in international programmes in areas where Ireland has research strengths when the opportunities arise.  It opens up access to external non-Exchequer funding opportunities and facilities for Irish researchers which would not be available otherwise.<\/p> <p>It is generally accepted that international collaboration on research brings together resources and the pooling of knowledge, enhancing scientific excellence and thus achieving greater success in addressing research problems, as well as greater efficiencies.  Participating in international research programmes facilitates inward and outward mobility of researchers, access to transnational collaborative networks, access to research facilities not available in Ireland and commercialising ideas and know-how.  There is an increasing trend at European level towards research funding schemes which involve pooling of funding by member states, with or without additional European funding.  SFI's participation in these schemes is restricted due to the limitations of the 2003 Act in respect of funding projects outside the State.  While some forms of pooling of funding can be carried out under the existing legislation, other forms of pooling are outside its scope.  The European Commission's proposals for research and innovation funding for the period 2014 to 2020, Horizon 2020, include the allocation of co-funding for member state collaborations, subject to &quot;clear financial commitments of the participating countries, including prior commitments to pool national and\/or regional investments for transnational research and innovation&quot;.  In these circumstances, unless Ireland participates in such fund-pooling arrangements, Irish researchers will not be in a position to compete for the funds, including the matching funds being made available from the European Union.  Therefore, as part of Ireland's efforts to maximise our drawdown from EU research funding, it will be necessary to be in a position to engage in &quot;common pot&quot; arrangements, where appropriate.  It is also appropriate that Ireland leverage research being funded by other states and share the economic impact.<\/p><p> In addition, scientific and engineering equipment and facilities are becoming more and more expensive to build and maintain.  Globally, particularly in Europe, the solution is to share development and operational costs.  Researchers in participating states can use such infrastructure and machinery.  If Ireland cannot contribute to such infrastructure, access to it by our researchers may be restricted to the detriment of research here and the intended enterprise consequences.  In some of these programmes there may be no guaranteed &quot;<i>juste retour<\/i>&quot; in respect of an Irish contribution, but participation in such programmes would be evaluated on the basis of Irish research strengths in the specific area.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the other matters dealt with in the Bill.  I will deal first with the reorganisation of enterprise development functions in the Shannon free zone.  On 27 November last the Government agreed to implement the decision taken in principle last May to merge Shannon Development with Shannon Airport in order to create a new aviation-focused entity with a commercial mandate in public ownership.  The Government agreed a number of actions which would be implemented to give effect to this decision.  These include the separation of Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority and the decision to transfer Shannon Development's functions in respect of indigenous enterprise and foreign direct investment to Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, respectively.  The latter decision will act as a catalyst for economic development and job creation as it will ensure indigenous and multinational industry already in the Shannon region or considering locating there will have access to a comprehensive range of supports.  By merging a strong independent Shannon Airport with the extensive property holdings, experience and expertise of Shannon Development, we will create a strong new State company which will work with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland on developing an international aviation services centre in the region.  The implementation of these decisions represents a new start for enterprise and job creation in the Shannon region.<\/p><p> In order to bring about the transfer of enterprise functions, it is necessary to remove the restrictions which prevent IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland from providing enterprise functions in the Shannon free zone.  Section 8 of the Bill provides for the repeal of section 11(2) of the Industrial Development Act 1986 which prevents Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland from providing and administering grants and other financial facilities for industry in the Shannon free zone.  The subsection also prevents the agencies from providing, developing, constructing, altering, adapting, maintaining and administering industrial estates and factory buildings, together with the associated facilities of such estates and buildings in the Shannon free zone.  It can be seen, therefore, that this provision is required to give full effect to the Government's decision of last November.  It is without prejudice to future legislative developments required to place the new organisational arrangement on a statutory basis.  Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Shannon Development are in regular contact to ensure there will be a smooth transfer of enterprise functions, with no disruption to the level of services provided for client companies.  <\/p><p> On the wider issue of establishing the new company, a high level steering group comprising the Secretaries General of a number of key Departments, a senior ICTU representative and the chair of the Shannon Airport Authority, is meeting regularly to oversee the transitional arrangements in both Shannon Development and Shannon Airport and full implementation of the Government's decision on the establishment of the new company.<\/p><p> The Bill provides for reform of the legislation governing the collection of research and development data by Forf\u00e1s.  The Science and Technology Act 1987 provides for the preparation by Forf\u00e1s of a science budget on a periodic basis.  It obliges bodies funded under the science budget to supply to Forf\u00e1s such information in such form and at such time as it may require.  The data, collated and published biennially by Forf\u00e1s as the &quot;science budget&quot;, measure overall expenditure on science and technology in the Government sector.  The areas of expenditure measured are much broader than and do not align with current international practice in monitoring science, technology and innovation expenditure.  It is, therefore, considered that the resulting survey is neither a useful policy tool nor an effective use of staff resources.  The deletion of these provisions is, therefore, proposed as an administrative efficiency measure.  The tone of my speech suggests one is a bridge to another, but it is another part of the Bill.  It is not a continuation of the Shannon Development piece but a new part.  However, Forf\u00e1s will continue to compile on an annual basis a major component of the science budget, known as &quot;Government budget appropriations or outlays on research and development&quot;, GBAORD, an internationally comparable metric carried out using harmonised concepts and definitions under OECD definitions. This is required under a Commission regulation relating to statistics for science and technology.  The Bill requires an institution to supply information to Forf\u00e1s from time to time for the purposes of the Commission regulation and in respect of research and development funded wholly or partly from moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  This will give statutory backing for the collection of data by Forf\u00e1s for the GBAORD survey and other purposes.<\/p><p> The opportunity is being taken in the Bill to align the legislation governing SFI and Enterprise Ireland with the Freedom of Information Acts.  It is important to note that SFI and Enterprise Ireland are bodies to which the Freedom of Information Acts apply.  However, section 16 of the Industrial Development Act 1998 in respect of Enterprise Ireland and section 17 of the 2003 Act in respect of SFI prohibit disclosure of confidential information by board members, staff and other specified persons.<\/p> <p>It is proposed to make these sections subject to the Freedom of Information Acts and thereby allow for disclosure of confidential information in accordance with those Acts.<\/p><p>I will now summarise the sections of the Bill.  Section 1 sets out the definitions of terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 provides that expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act will, subject to sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 3 provides for further definitions of terms used in the Bill, including the definition of &quot;applied research&quot;.  Section 4 sets out the revised functions of Science Foundation Ireland.  Section 5 deals with the provision by the foundation of funding to institutions based in Northern Ireland and to international projects.<\/p><p>Section 6 provides for a consequential amendment to the original Act governing Science Foundation Ireland arising from the extension of its remit to applied research.  The 2003 Act provides that the foundation should comment in its annual reports on the oriented basic research funded by it.  This requirement is now extended to encompass all research funded by the foundation. Section 7 provides for the repeal of provision relating to compilation of the science budget by Forf\u00e1s.  Section 8 repeals the restrictions on Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in respect of the Shannon region.<\/p><p>Section 9 provides for the new provisions for collection of research and development data by Forf\u00e1s in place of the provisions repealed under section 7.  Section 10 provides for the amendment of the confidentiality provisions applying to Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland by making them subject to the freedom of information Acts.  Section 11 provides for the Short Title to the Bill, the collective citation provisions and the commencement of the provisions relating to the legislation.<\/p><p>I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700009#H01100","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360244400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and wish him continued success with his most interesting portfolio.<\/p><p>Fianna F\u00e1il established Science Foundation Ireland in 2003.  It was initially headed up by Dr. Bill Harris, a visionary dedicated to driving much-needed scientific progress and innovation in Ireland.  I wish to focus on the importance of innovation in the context of indigenous companies and the contribution they make to creating employment.  At a very interesting meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts last week, the chief executive of Enterprise Ireland, Mr. Frank Ryan, referred to the fact that the indigenous companies being established now are different from those which preceded them.  He stated &quot;we understand that in a small economy, exports sustain and create jobs&quot;.  Last year, this country's total exports amounted to \u20ac15.2 billion.  Clients of Enterprise Ireland exported more in 2011 than at any time in the history of the State.  The support and promotion of in-company research and development and innovation, as well as collaborative innovation with others, is central to the development of Enterprise Ireland-supported indigenous companies.<\/p><p>From my experience in establishing Lir Chocolates, I am aware that innovation lies at the heart of entrepreneurship, be it in a high-potential start-up company turning knowledge into solutions or in established companies that are continually improving their products and processes and thus their ability to compete and win sales overseas.<\/p><p>An interesting issue which has arisen is the banks' lack of ability and capacity to support modern high-tech companies.  Mr. Niall O'Donnellan is responsible for dealing with the banks on behalf of Enterprise Ireland.  When asked about the banks and their relationship with the new companies to which I refer at last week's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, he stated that Enterprise Ireland established a banking relations department in 2008 in response to the credit crunch.  Mr. O'Donnellan also indicated that the immediate issue in this regard was access to credit for the companies with which Enterprise Ireland was dealing and which were under considerable pressure at the time.  Furthermore, he said that Enterprise Ireland established relationships with the three primary banks, namely, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.  He went on to indicate that when it became involved in discussions with the banks, Enterprise Ireland realised that the Irish banking system was not fit for purpose for the modern SME export sector in particular.<\/p><p>Mr. O'Donnellan pointed out to the committee that there were three aspects in this regard.  The first of these related to the fact that the banking system here had not become familiar with the modern technology economy &quot;so software, for example, was a sector that Irish banks would have very little involvement in up to that period of time&quot;.  It is fascinating that the banks were incapable of helping indigenous high-tech companies to develop their businesses.  Mr. O'Donnellan stated that Enterprise Ireland set up workshops with the three main banks &quot;in terms of educating them about the kinds of companies we work with and introducing them to various groups of companies: the Irish Software Association; the IMDA - the med-tech association, and so on.&quot;  His colleague, Mr. Frank Ryan, also informed the Committee of Public Accounts that Ireland is now viewed differently than was the case previously.  Mr. Ryan stated that in the past Sweden, Switzerland and so on were perceived to be high-tech countries and that Ireland has now entered that league.<\/p><p>There has been a dramatic change in the quality of the products being produced here.  Ireland is no longer the equivalent of low-cost company, rather it is a high-tech developed economy which can compete abroad.  I am aware, from personal experience, that innovation is the lifeblood of any company.  The Bill before the House will allow Science Foundation Ireland to add lifeblood to the growing number of superb indigenous companies operating in the high-tech area here.  Companies must innovate, relentlessly and on a daily basis, if they are to compete.<\/p><p>I congratulate the departmental officials and all involved in the evolution of Science Foundation Ireland.  Anecdotal evidence indicates that Dr. Bill Harris used to fly in from the United States and go straight to work.  This meant that staff had to open the offices of Science Foundation Ireland at 5 a.m. on certain days.  This is the new Ireland.  I wish everybody involved continued success.<\/p><p>I used to deliver Lir chocolates by hand.  I recall taking the cheapest means of travel to destinations abroad in order to do so.  I was obliged to travel over and return on the same day because I could not afford an overnight stay.  Those involved in the high-tech sector cannot operate in that way.  They require access to cash and credit in order that they might expand their businesses and travel abroad to meet their customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700013#M00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1360245000,"counter":127,"content":"<\/a> <p>I welcome the Minister.  This is an important Bill.  We can see that Science Foundation Ireland has been very successful over the past ten years.  Now is the time to establish new structures better suited to a new era and to new developments in science and research.  This Bill will give Science Foundation Ireland the power to fund applied research and to promote and support awareness and understanding of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  The Bill will also support collaborative research with bodies in Northern Ireland and other countries.  This Bill will steer the direction of Science Foundation Ireland funding.<\/p><p>Under the leadership of Professor Mark Ferguson, Science Foundation Ireland continues to progress and to work with researchers in higher education.  Oireachtas Members have always received excellent briefing from the staff of Science Foundation Ireland.  They provide us with wonderful insights into the activities of Crann or Tyndall in Cork and various centres of excellence and research around the country.  The recent publication of Agenda 2020 outlines how Science Foundation Ireland will strategically reflect the research prioritisation developed under Jim O'Hara, the former chief executive officer of Intel.  It will focus on delivering ideas and developing internationally recognised research centres.  Ireland has been very successful in that area.  It will ensure that researchers trained by Science Foundation Ireland will be employed in industry.  Professor Ferguson stated that the emphasis will be on research with impact.  That is the same kind of language used by the Minister of State.  There is a need for applied research as well as basic research in order to leverage a result and an application from the various forms of research.  There has been much debate in the media between scientists and researchers.  Blue-sky thinking is needed.  For the benefit of society, basic research needs to be turned into real applications.  The Minister of State will chair and steer an implementation group which will give him the flexibility to implement change where necessary.  <\/p><p>The research prioritisation steering group produced its report a year ago.  Times have changed in the past ten years with regard to the type of work and research.  The research group identified 14 different priority areas.  Four criteria were required to be fulfilled: a global market needed to exist in which Irish-based enterprise could compete; public research and development in Ireland is required to exploit the opportunity; strength in research disciplines; and the existence of a national or global challenge to which Ireland could respond.  The report of the expert group outlined a number of priority areas which are acknowledged as critical, including medical devices, health and independent living, diagnostics, therapeutics, food for health, sustainable food production, smart grids, manufacturing competitiveness, process technologies, innovation and services and business process.  The group did excellent work which has provided a format for future progress.  <\/p><p>The Minister of State referred to the work of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  In 2002 more than 40% of job announcements by the IDA have been in companies with links to Science Foundation Ireland research teams.  This equates to 4,000 jobs.  The links with higher education and with Science Foundation Ireland have been invaluable for IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in their efforts to attract foreign direct investment and in developing indigenous industries.  The emphasis will be on turning research into marketable products or services and this is welcome.<\/p><p>The promotion of science, technology, engineering and maths was formerly the work of the discover science and engineering programme.  The budget in this area has been reduced but the area is showing dividends in that more students are taking these subjects in last year's leaving certificate with a subsequent uptake at third level.<\/p><p>The Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation published a report on this area.  It recommended that industry could fund and support research because it would be to the benefit of industry.  I thank the Minister of State for introducing a Bill which is a step along the way in the funding of research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700014#N00100","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"speech","time":1360245000,"counter":128,"content":"<\/a> <p>I welcome the Minister of State.  As Senator Clune said, it is a most important topic.  We need the reforms which the Minister of State is proposing but we need to stay flexible.  He referred to the need to fund applied research in addition to basic research and the need to promote awareness of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  The 2003 Act specifies the areas of information and communications technology, and biotechnology.  The 2008 Act added the areas of sustainable energy and energy-efficient technologies.  As Senator Clune said, the committee decided on the 14 priority areas.<\/p><p>It is interesting to reflect that after the first stages of ten and five years, it is rational to ask - although some of the people involved might be annoyed with us - whether Ireland plans to do anything in the area of sustainable energy.  If the current price of energy does not make us make use of it, what is the point of having a research programme?  The same applies with regard to energy-efficient technologies.  One of the reasons for the price advantage of Ryanair over other airlines is that its fleet is much younger.  Mr. Boeing does that for you; the rising price of aviation fuel is factored into the design of aircraft.  It is right to ask those questions.  <\/p> <p>What surprised me in some of the recent debates about contracts of indefinite duration was that some people thought that when, as it were, the soft money for research ran out they were guaranteed a job for life.  They could be facing some trouble in that regard.  We should have flexibility, including perhaps the blue-sky research to which people refer.  Perhaps 10% could be kept for blue-sky research.  We have national priorities as well.  Perhaps the national priorities, such as the two I mentioned, should be a rolling scheme whereby we could have 14 priorities but reserve the right to drop two of them every year.  That would keep it moving.  Otherwise there is a danger that, as one researcher put it to me, one is taking a form book that might be ten years out of date to spend money up to five years hence.  The form book is not a bad reference because, as the clich\u00e9 has it, one is picking winners.  However, one is using a very old form book and the race is not due for another number of years, so that flexibility is necessary.<\/p><p>I will be a little self-indulgent in referencing section 4, which provides that the Minister prescribes &quot;strategic&quot; areas.  I propose that the word &quot;strategic&quot; be dropped from Irish public administration.  It does not appear to mean anything at this stage.  Where it means &quot;important&quot;, that is fine.  Wondering what it meant, I looked up the definition in the dictionary.  Among the definitions was: &quot;designed to disorganise the enemy's internal economy and to destroy morale&quot;.  When I hear people at universities use the word &quot;strategic&quot; I know it is time to bail out.  The word has definitely been associated with more nonsense than average.<\/p><p>We needed to do this because an bord snip nua was quite caustic in this regard.  It found that scientists and engineers are always interested in inputs and have not the slightest interest in outputs.  In fact, the group wrote in 2009 that it was strongly of the view that substantial reductions in funding were warranted, given the significant amounts invested to date, the lack of verifiable economic benefits resulting from the investment and the inflationary impact of funding on research and administration salaries.  It pointed out that administering the scheme involved more than 200 staff in the seven universities, costing over \u20ac16 million per annum.  That is just guys filling in pieces of paper.  That reference is on pages 68 and 69 of the report by an bord snip nua.  There was a view that it was almost ungentlemanly to ask - even if it is wonderful for the people involved - if they actually did anything that made any difference to the outside world.  Keeping it flexible and facing up to people who feel seriously insulted when one asks them what the results of their research were should be par for the course.<\/p><p>We all appreciate the value of this system.  One correspondent wrote to me that, while arguing against his own interests did not affect himself, a range of science and engineering disciplines, including social and health sciences, have been at the margins of Irish research and innovation policy for decades.  We should not leave people out.  It is not always the people who shout the loudest who should get the money.  There is a bias in favour of STEM - science, technology, engineering and mathematics - but that is not by any means the full complement of knowledge in the universities.  The AHSS - arts, humanities and social sciences - subjects have been marginalised.  That seriously distorts the resource allocation within universities.  They are areas of knowledge, and that is very important.<\/p><p>The downside is the loss of interest by some of the recipients of funds in giving lectures.  The basic assumption of universities is that those of 18 years and older from this country, whose taxpayer parents pay for the universities, should see the important people.  I have a document that states that one can use this money to buy out one's lecturing.  Why would I buy it out?  That is why I went there.  I attended a Trinity College in which all the senior people gave lectures to first years.  They regarded that as their basic duty.  However, I encountered some people who, when I asked them if they gave any lectures, replied &quot;My career is currently not teaching-centric.&quot;  In fact, universities are teaching-centric.  One owes that duty.  Where is the next generation of scientists, engineers and economists to come from if the top people are off working on very large grants and avoiding contact?<\/p><p>The excess bureaucracy problem is mentioned by an bord snip nua.  It is also mentioned by the Royal Irish Academy.  It says that reforms are needed in the delivery of our research budget and suggests that we tailor government practices to individual institutions; protect and foster academic freedom; reduce bureaucracy; create and implement sophisticated validation methods; place academic practice and community centre stage; and promote sensitive participative management practices.<\/p><p>The Minister should look at the 14 priorities.  One of them is more efficient business.  If somebody runs his business more efficiently, his profit increases.  Is some of the pleading by Irish enterprises for the Minister to spend more money due to the fact that their opposite numbers in the United States fund fellowships and scholarships for students?  Is this just an imitation of the Irish Farmers' Association by multinational firms wanting to reduce their research budgets by transferring them to the Minister?  They are quite good at getting tax breaks as well, as people have mentioned.  There has to be a different type of enterprise by enterprises, and I look forward to much more funding and co-funding of research by industry.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned Shannon.  I attended the meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications at which there was a discussion with the new chairman of Shannon Airport.  The Commission for Aviation Regulation said in 2003 that Shannon Airport is massively over-manned.  If it is to make itself an attractive airport in the way the Minister envisages, it must deal with its labour productivity.  Its capital productivity was not up to much either.<\/p><p>This is an interesting area.  My ability to respond is limited by long hours - the Seanad works until 6 a.m.  The Minister is going in the right direction but he should not lock himself into rigid models, because it is very hard to predict where the best research will be.  Indeed, he must look beyond those who have grown used to large funds to the very able people elsewhere in universities where some small investment could be worthwhile.  He should also keep it flexible outside the system of 14 priorities.  Some of the 14 might already be redundant, but we can discuss that further on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700014#N00200","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360245600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  It is always good to have him here.  I also thank him for his positive comments about Senators' contributions this morning on the Order of Business.  I will remind him of his words and seek his support when the referendum on the Seanad comes before the people.<\/p><p>In March 2012, the Minister of State, Deputy Se\u00e1n Sherlock, and the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, launched the Government's plan to target the majority of the core \u20ac500 million budget that the State spends on scientific research every year on areas with the greatest potential for economic return.  That sum is a very considerable amount of money and in today\u2019s economic climate it is vital that the return on this investment is as high as possible, particularly in terms of job provision.  Scientific research is the means by which new knowledge can be adopted by enterprise, woven into high-value goods and services and then exported to the world market.  That is all good news for the economy and it is the reason investment in research continues to be a priority for this Government.  In trying to ensure the State gets as much return as possible for the large amount invested, this Bill is part of a series of changes being put in place, including a research prioritisation exercise, a one-stop shop for commercialising research and a new strategy from SFI, which aims to become the best science funding agency in the world.<\/p><p>The main focus of the Bill is on extending the remit of SFI.  Established under the Industrial Development Act 2003, the foundation provides grants to researchers and research groups based in higher education institutions.  The Bill will expand its remit to include applied research, with the objective of increasing the potential for turning the ideas generated into products, services and jobs.  At present, there is a gap in this area which needs to be filled, so that ideas generated by research can be further supported and developed by organisations such as Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  In 2012, more than 40% of IDA job announcements, representing more than 4,000 jobs, were in companies with research links to SFI research teams.<\/p><p>Since the establishment of SFI in 2003, the level of scientific research taking place in Ireland has grown to world class status.<\/p> <p>The Government announced last March that it would refocus public research spending on 14 areas with the greatest potential for creating jobs and growth, and the director general of SFI, Professor Mark Ferguson, has supported this.  He was much quoted this morning.  He sees it as a way of leaning towards targeted research instead of having an emphasis on blue-sky or basic research, which has been the focus in recent years.  However, within these 14 areas there will be ample room for basic and applied research.  Concerns have been voiced by scientists that funding for basic research will be harder to acquire but the experts say there is not a real divide between basic and applied research.  It is a continuum where one feeds into the other.  Without knowledge application, nobody benefits.  Without new knowledge generation, there is no application.<\/p><p>Not only will requests to SFI for funding have to be scientifically excellent; they must also clearly describe the potential impact of the science in an economic, social or environmental context.  The 14 priorities put a strong focus on life sciences and information technology as well as innovation in manufacturing, services and business processes.  This year, SFI will allocate more than \u20ac150 million in funding for research and by 2015, 100% of funding from the foundation will be focused on these 14 areas.  The Bill also includes a function for SFI in the promotion of science, technology, engineering and maths.  The responsibility for the administration of the programme on discovering science and engineering, which was under the remit of Forf\u00e1s, has been transferred to the foundation.  This will promote a positive attitude to careers in science, technology, engineering and maths and promote greater understanding by the public of their importance. <\/p><p>Another important element to the Bill is that it will allow SFI to broaden its scope beyond the State, allowing it to provide direct funding to institutions in Northern Ireland and to have the possibility of entering into cost-sharing arrangements with international partners.  Currently, SFI's participation in these schemes is restricted due to the 2003 Act and Irish researchers are potentially missing out on additional funding.  It is important for Ireland, through SFI, to be ready to participate in international programmes in areas where we have research strengths when the opportunities arise.  Sharing development and operational costs also makes sense because of the increasing cost of scientific and engineering infrastructure.  Ireland must have the facility to contribute to such infrastructure so that we, in turn, can benefit from the research investment made by other states. <\/p><p>Ireland has come a long way in terms of scientific research.  We are now ranked third in the world for immunology research, sixth in nanotechnology and eighth in materials science.  The legislation will ensure the groundwork done over the years will be built on by better targeting of State resources.  Translating the results of high-class research into marketable goods and services is the challenge for the future.  I congratulate the Minister of State and his team for their hard work in preparation for the Bill, which I commend to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700015#O00200","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360246200,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the opportunity to discuss the role of research in contributing to knowledge in the economy.  Even though it has a number of concerns, my party will not oppose the Bill.  The Minister of State will see the concerns as genuine and may be able to address them in his response.  I recognise that the Government has safeguarded, to an extent, funding for research while other public services have experienced severe cuts.  I give credit to the Minister of State where it is due in that regard.  The legislation will allow us to maximise the money spent.<\/p><p>The role of research in a modern economy is crucial.  A strong research and development sector is an essential part of a modern knowledge economy.  The future sustainability of our economy will be based on research and development of skills, knowledge and products.  Therefore, Sinn F\u00e9in is supportive of the measure and recognises that the responsibility for this goes beyond the role of SFI and the third level institutions, although they unquestionably have a vital role.<\/p><p>It is striking that one of the areas of development is computer technology and the Internet.  However, computer studies is not a core subject for schools or included among subjects for the junior certificate and leaving certificate examinations.  I have raised these matters on many occasions at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The Government should give serious consideration to this point.<\/p><p>I also support the extension of the role of SFI to support applied research.  It is undoubtedly welcome.  We are also very much of the view that a balance must be struck.  To some degree, we are concerned that the focus on applied research may undermine the work in oriented basic research.  One scientist claims that the work of Peter Higgs in identifying the particle that has become known as the Higgs boson might not have been supported if the focus was solely on applied research, as commercial interest at the time would have been limited.  Pure mathematics, which is the starting point for many of the areas of applied research, may not be supported to the degree it should be.  I ask the Minister of State how he intends to maintain a balance between the oriented basic approach and applied research.  This is essential to ensure the long-term nature of research is not lost to the short-term return.<\/p><p>At the release of the research prioritisation plan, Jim O'Hara, the chairman of the steering group, called for the delivery of specific economic outcomes from investment in research.  To date, the Government's economic plans have been short on economic outcomes and targets.  Our various jobs strategies, the same proposals and investments reheated and re-promoted, have failed to deliver the jobs we need in any real way.  Can the Minister of State outline how we will measure the success of investment in research?  Will SFI monitor patent applications, jobs created, the value of the product and the benefits that will accrue from it?<\/p><p>I acknowledged that not all investment in applied research transfers to productivity and product.  However, as much it does, we should seek to measure it.  Questions must be asked.  How will the Government ensure the State is not subsidising investment without a return?  How will the Minister of State safeguard a return for public investment?  Will SFI look for an equity stake?  Will it seek a return on investments made?  Will it retain ownership of patents?<\/p><p>Under section 4 of the Bill, SFI also gets additional responsibility for the promotion and support of awareness of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  Given the lack of facilities in schools and the lack of computer science at junior certificate and leaving certificate level, how does the Minister of State see this being supported and rolled out within the existing SFI budget?<\/p><p>Under section 5, we welcome recognition of the need for partnerships with institutions and researchers in the North.  More could be done to promote cross-Border research partnerships.  I would like to hear the view of the Minister of State on how this can be further developed.<\/p><p>Finally, I am concerned and perplexed at the inclusion of section 8.  It differs entirely from the remainder of the Bill and refers to the Government proposals to change the remit of Shannon Development.  A separate and comprehensive Bill should have been developed on this matter for the full consideration of the Oireachtas.  This should have been debated on its merits, which would have been a preferable way to enact legislation.  I give the Bill a qualified welcome but I have some concerns.  Given the day that is in it, a qualified welcome is the best I can do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700016#P00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1360246200,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I am very grateful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700016#P00300","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1360246200,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I must declare an interest at the outset.  While I derive no income or funds from SFI, I am the leader of a consortium funded by SFI, which will be in receipt of approximately \u20ac7.5 million worth of research funds over a five-year period.  This has enabled us to build a unique nationwide consortium of cancer researchers working together to try to deal with the inconsistencies of a country that has a relatively small population but a relatively large number of academic institutions.<\/p> <p>The leadership SFI provided in that regard was simply irreplaceable.<\/p><p>Let me proselytise for one second.  As the Minister of State knows, science is not a pursuit carried out by eggheads in white coats with thick glasses.  Science is knowledge; it is the language of the universe.  We are all doing it every day of our lives.  Our discoveries that fire is hot, that things fall down rather than up and that, as a baby, one should not go near stairs are all manifestations of the scientific process.  I am a very firm believer in the necessity for democracies to have scientifically informed and sophisticated populations.<\/p><p>History is replete with examples of where a lack of knowledge of science was quickly plugged with ignorance.  In certain circumstances, that ignorance was harnessed with very negative and anti-social consequences.  I do not want to invoke Godwin's law, but I must mention the fact that the large and successful totalitarian states of the 20th century such as the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany had at their core a willingness to subjugate the truth of science to ideological fervour.  A famous case arose in the Soviet Union on foot on the now discredited genetic theories of a gentleman called Lysenko, whose crackpot theories on plant genetics were such that he was single-handedly responsible for several of the union's large famines.  We do not have to go into detail about the crackpot ideological theories used by the Nazis to justify their wars of racial superiority and extermination.<\/p><p>Worryingly for a sophisticated country such as the United States, it has in the past 12 months seen evidence of the consequences of a lack of scientific knowledge.  There are reports that perhaps as many as 50% of Americans believe dinosaurs and humans coexisted during the mere 6,000 years in which they believe our universe has existed.  We have heard a US politician state rape could not result in pregnancy owing to a false understanding of biology.  We have heard others state evolution is a lie from the pit of hell.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that it is good for society to be scientifically informed.  I was delighted to see in SFI's strategic report such a heavy emphasis on curriculum development and the placement of science at the centre of society, commerce, etc.<\/p><p>The economists have criticised scientists, with whom I align myself loosely.  I do a little scientific research, but I am primarily a clinician.  The economists have criticised scientists for focusing on inputs rather than outputs.  Let us for one second consider the relative outputs that have occurred in the past two centuries of science and economics.  Scientists have worked out how to have clean water, how the universe and gravity work and how to free us from the shackles of gravity such that we can fly.  They have given us information technology, conquered many, if not most, infectious diseases and have gone a long way towards curing cancer and understanding the basis of circulatory disease.  They have increased life expectancy.  In most western countries with access to the fruits of science life expectancy has increased from approximately 30 years to 75.  There is a long way to go, but we have done well.  During the past two centuries apparently no two economists agreed on anything.  Economics schools may follow von Hayek, Friedman, Keynes, Marx or Adam Smith, but they might as well be talking about different disciplines.  I mentioned this morning that if doctors were as consistent as economists, one doctor might say one should have an operation, while another, giving a second opinion, might say one should become an opera star.  At least, the scientific method produces consistency.<\/p><p>Why should we conduct research and support science?  Knowledge is good in its own right.  If there was nothing else, having knowledge would be better than having none, as knowledge leads to tangible benefits.  All the advances we have made in technology and health care, for example, have come from somebody's scientific discoveries five or, ultimately, 400 years ago.  The pursuit of knowledge is good and has many collateral benefits.  It increases the quality of education and training and what people do in the health service and the manufacturing sector.<\/p><p>Knowledge delivers enormous economic benefits.  We are not blessed with considerable natural resources in Ireland, but we can ensure good leveraging of our national intelligence and skills base.  SFI has been a great success.  I was out of the country from 1985 until 1993.  I became very involved in trying to set up research activities when I returned and have noted that the changes in the past decade, since SFI has been on the scene, have been colossal.  In stark contrast with most other State agencies, SFI is highly effective.  It is highly efficient and has a very good management structure.  It believes in attracting the best international experts to assess what should be funded.  If a project is good, it is funded and we get out of the way.  We come back a couple of years later and ask for the report card and whether the job has been done.  SFI does not micro-manage, which is the reason science in Ireland has accelerated to such an extraordinary degree in the past decade.  &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; - SFI is working well.<\/p><p>The idea of incentivising applied research while still holding basic research in esteem is valid.  The distinction is blurring as time passes.  Certainly in cancer care, concepts that once appeared incredibly philosophical and abstract have actually been translated into treatments in relatively short periods.  Research that seemed very basic has actually become very applied to the real benefit of patients.  Ireland, importantly, has had some role in this and other areas, principally immunology.<\/p><p>This is the wrong time to give anything other than a great message of support.  We had a country that deluded itself into believing we could all get rich by selling one another houses and that we needed vast numbers operating in a regulatory capacity to try to build an economy.  What we really need to do as we rebalance and reformat the economy is ensure there is a strong, technical engineering and scientific sector.  The job SFI has done and will continue to do will aid in the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700016#P00400","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360246800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I genuinely thank every Member who has contributed to the debate.  I will respond as best I can and some very valid points have been raised.  If I do not respond to all of them, I will be happy to respond again on another day, with the permission of the House.<\/p><p>Let me begin with the dialogue that has emerged on basic research as opposed to applied research.  It has been said we cannot take the foot off the pedal with regard to basic research.  The Higgs boson analogy is drawn upon regularly, but it is somewhat tired at this stage.  To be blunt, it is normally informed by those who have not really read the fine print.  There is no danger that we will take the foot off the pedal in funding basic research.  We must provide context.  On 25 January SFI announced a fund worth \u20ac60 million covering basic research, computer-assisted neurosurgery, animation, inflammatory diseases, hepatitis C, ICT, tissue engineering, chemistry, biofilms, microbiology, carbon sequestration, farm waste for bioenergy, etc.  It is incorrect to imply we are taking the foot off the pedal in this regard.  The remit of SFI is very clear.  It is important, however, that when the country is going through a period of economic turmoil, we seek to ensure taxpayers' money is invested to achieve the greatest societal and economic outputs.  That is what we were trying to achieve.  Advancing the remit of SFI is part of what I call the stage-gate process.<\/p><p>We acknowledge the role of Dr. Harris and previous Governments in this area.  It is an apolitical space.  It is a space in which the only differences of emphasis might pertain to whether one funds, with taxpayers' money, basic or applied research.  In the past ten or 15 years emphasis was placed on building capacity, human capital and putting bricks and mortar in place through the programme for research in third level institutions.  It is now a question of being in the top ten in the areas I outlined in my opening remarks.  It is a question of recognising that we must now move to a new stage of excellence.  We must not take the foot off the pedal; rather, we must prioritise the relevant areas.<\/p> <p>It must be remembered that funding for Science Foundation Ireland is approximately \u20ac150 million.  The Higher Education Authority budget is approximately \u20ac1.02 billion.  Senator Clune spoke about the 14 key areas of research prioritisation.  I chair the prioritisation action group whose purpose is to provide action plans for the key areas of priority so that we can fund those areas and bring industry engagement into new areas of opportunity to maximise economic and societal output.  We must bear in mind that the budget line for the 14 areas is approximately \u20ac440 million.  There is a large tranche of money available for research from other sources.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Barrett that we must have some degree of flexibility.  That is why as the Minister of State with responsibility for research, I am leading a conversation whose end point is a well-rounded view of the landscape such that the Irish Research Council talks to Science Foundation Ireland, to the Health Research Board and the HEA and that everybody is moving in one direction with consensus.  We can then ensure that there is flexibility built into the system such that we find mechanisms or small pots of money to fund the perceived outliers who are doing niche, blue-sky or esoteric research which is no less important to, and legitimate in, our society.  Impact is the key factor.  We no longer fund for the sake of funding but on the basis that those people in those areas can prove that there is an impact whether economic or societal.<\/p><p>That does not exclude the basic research scientists.  For example, I do not think there is an over-emphasis on funding stem-cell research but we must ensure that we fund science, technology, engineering and mathematics in a way that ensures we have a throughput starting at primary level to bring a cadre of young bright Irish minds to fuel the tertiary sector.  That is in line with SFI's Agenda 2020 document whose philosophy and vision is that Ireland becomes one of the best countries in the world at achieving excellence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700017#Q00200","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360247400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>May I interrupt for a second?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700018#R00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1360247400,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I am over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700018#R00300","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1360247400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>No you are not over time.

This was extrapolated from fourth class students.  It is vital that we make a greater investment in continuing professional development in that area.<\/p><p>With regard to pure mathematics, I find it interesting that people raise this point when there is a clear public record and proof that in the last round of SFI funding we gave more than \u20ac2 million to MSSI at the University of Limerick for the examination of pure mathematics.

As the Minister of State is aware, last October the Private Security Authority, PSA, under a ministerial statutory instrument, initiated a new form of licensing regime for people working in the private security sector installing security-related equipment such as CCTV cameras, electronic gates, electronic security barriers and so on.  It is important that we have regulation and proper standards and that we do not have rogue operators and cowboy operators such as those who were involved in other sectors of the building industry over the years, much to the detriment of consumers and tradesmen.  In this instance, however, the licensing regime is draconian.  The licensing fee is far too hefty.  It is causing severe hardship in this sector.  It is punitive and is putting a lot of pressure on small electrical contractors and small businesses who do not have the resources to meet this level of licensing fee, and it must be renewed biannually.  While it is important to have regulation it is also important that it is fair rather than punitive.<\/p><p>I understand that the Minister for Justice and Equality has agreed to enter into a review process with the PSA and that process is drawing to a conclusion.  What stage is it at now and when will the Minister make an announcement that will hopefully allay and assuage the fears of people and contractors working in that sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700018#R01300","speaker":"1143"},{"type":"speech","time":1360247400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Whelan for raising this matter on the Adjournment.<\/p> <p>I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, who regrets that he is unable to be with us this afternoon. <\/p><p>In the first instance, I would like to point out that the Private Security Authority, established under the Private Security Services Act 2004, as amended, is the statutory body responsible for the regulation and licensing of the private security industry in the State.  The authority is an independent agency under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>The 2004 Act, as amended, sets out the activities in the private security industry which are, or will be, subject to licensing.  The licensing of installers of security equipment, encompassing intruder alarms, CCTV and access control systems, is one such activity covered by the 2004 legislation.  Last year, the Minister, Deputy Shatter consented to the making of regulations, by the PSA, to extend licensing to contractors and private security employers providing security services installing CCTV and access control systems.  This completed the authority's licensing of contractors in the electronic security sector with the licensing of contractors involved in installing intruder alarms having commenced back in 2006.<\/p><p>In accordance with these regulations, from 1 October 2012, all existing contractors providing licensable CCTV and access control services must be in possession of an appropriate licence or have an application lodged with the authority.  The regulations also provide for the licensing of contractors who maintain intruder alarm systems.  The Minister is informed by the authority that the extension of its licensing to these particular sectors was in preparation for a considerable time and that it involved two public consultation stages - both of which were notified to industry stakeholders including bodies representing electrical contractors.<\/p><p>As the Senator will be aware, contractors such as those in the CCTV sector, as part of their application, are required to pay a licence fee to the authority.  The authority has informed the Minister that the current fee, which is for a two year licence, was set by the authority in 2005 and has not been increased since.  The Senator will no doubt appreciate that the provision of a regulatory environment understandably has cost implications for the industry but the public and Industry itself both benefit from regulation.  The Minister is assured by the authority that it has made every effort to ensure that costs are kept to a minimum and has also introduced an instalment payment option to assist contractors with paying for their licence.  The authority is aware of the genuine hardship faced, in particular, by small businesses in light of the current economic climate and so continues to seek ways of easing the burden of regulation while at the same time meeting its statutory obligations.<\/p><p>As regards the fees charged by the PSA, notwithstanding that while the current PSA fee structure has remained unchanged since 2005, the Minister has been aware for some time that the fee level has been the subject of much criticism, particularly following the introduction of the newest phase of regulation when the CCTV and access control sectors were brought within its scope.  As correctly indicated by the Senator, this phase of regulation brought some elements of the work of electrical contractors within the scope of the PSA for the first time - many of whom are smaller operators with relatively small turnover.  The Minister appreciates that the current fee may well be unduly burdensome for such operators.  Being mindful of the plight of such contractors, the Department of Justice and Equality and the PSA have been in consultation about a review of the fees in question.  Any change in fees requires a new statutory instrument to be drafted and the Department of Justice and Equality is in contact with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in that regard.  It is expected that the process will be completed in the near future and the Minister, Deputy Shatter will then be in a position to make an announcement on the matter.<\/p><p>Since the PSA first began licensing in 2006, there has been a welcome transformation of the private security industry which the Senator will appreciate has had many positive benefits for the industry, the wider business community and the public.  The authority has been in successful in combatting what were originally quite low standards in the industry, consumer confidence has improved overall, all contractors are now operating to the same standards, are tax compliant, vetted by the Garda and subject to ongoing monitoring and inspections by the authority.  The PSA, through its work has led to significantly improved compliance generally in areas such as taxation and welfare payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700018#R01400","speaker":"1000","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360248000,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and I call Senator Whelan who has one minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700019#S00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1360248000,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for attending and answering my question.

It has been a long week.  The national blood spot screening programme was rolled out to identify six rare diseases; the screening cards are also known as Guthrie cards.  Unfortunately the cards retained between 1966 and 1984 were destroyed as a result of water contamination.<\/p><p>The Data Protection Commissioner has ruled that the cards for the period 1984 to 2002 must be destroyed.  Many people in the medical profession believe such a move would be a retrograde step and that it is a wrong a decision.  They believe that vital research material has been scheduled for destruction.  The material could be used in the future.  The cards have already proved very helpful when used for research projects.  Is it necessary to destroy the cards?  Is there another way around the problem?  I ask that the HSE and the Data Protection Commissioner consider the matter further especially in view of the strong medical lobbying that has taken place.  I ask that the decision is reviewed and, if possible, reversed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700019#S00700","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1360248000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter on the Adjournment.  I am taking the Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  He would also like to thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides me with an opportunity to update the House.<\/p><p>In late 2009 the Data Protection Commissioner received a complaint from a member of the public on the retention of newborn screening cards.  The basis of the complaint, which was upheld by the Data Protection Commissioner, was that newborn screening cards should not be retained indefinitely without consent as this breached the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003. As the Data Protection Commissioner said &quot;it is important to make clear that the position that developed was unlawful and could not be allowed to continue&quot;.  There followed a series of meetings between the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner, representatives from the Department, the HSE and the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street.  This resulted in a number of changes to the national newborn blood spot screening programme.  These changes included obtaining written consent from the mother to have her newborn child screened, retention of the newborn screening card for ten years and retention of information on the result for 25 years.  During those ten years the card can only be used for checking the results or for other tests recommended by the child's doctor and for which the parent's or parents' permission will be sought, and quality assurance to develop and improve the screening programme and the health of babies and families in Ireland. <\/p> <p>It was also decided to destroy existing cards that are older than ten years.  It must be remembered that there is no written consent from parents for the retention or use of these newborn screening cards taken between 1984 and 2002 for research, or other, purposes.<\/p><p>Following representations from a number of people and organisations, who pointed out their potential value for research my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, requested the HSE to conduct a review of the decision to destroy these cards.  The review examined both the legal and ethical basis for retention of newborn screening cards and the potential use of the existing cards for research purposes.  The report and recommendations of the review group were submitted to the Minister in January 2012.  The review group supported the decision to destroy cards more than ten years old.  Following careful consideration this recommendation was accepted.  I must emphasise that this decision was taken to ensure that the HSE and the children's university hospital meet their ethical and legal obligations under the Data Protection Acts.<\/p><p>However, the review group explored how the cards could be made available to the research community in a way which is compatible with ethical and legal obligations.  In line with its recommendations, the HSE has begun an information campaign offering people the opportunity to have their screening card returned to them, prior to any cards being destroyed.  This will ensure that anyone who wishes to donate newborn screening cards for research will be afforded the opportunity to do so.  We must ensure continued public trust and support for the national newborn screening programme, a vital public health measure for children and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700019#S00800","speaker":"1000","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360248600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the information on this matter.

These are families who, as the Minister of State will know, were forced to move out of their homes overnight in October or November of 2011.  They have now just come through their second Christmas in temporary accommodation, still living with uncertainty about the future.  All that is certain is that they are not going back to Priory Hall.  The building was not fit for purpose when they left it and is now worse because it has been abandoned for the past 16 months.  However, the residents are still waiting for a long-term solution and still wondering what they will do about their mortgages and when the millstone of their Priory Hall apartments will be taken from around their necks.<\/p><p>There has been a resolution process in place for several months.  I am trying to bring together the stakeholders to agree on a long-term solution.  I tabled this Adjournment debate to ask the Minister of State if there is progress to be reported.  I hope there is, because the continuing uncertainty is a nightmare for the families.  It is also crazy from the State's point of view because the longer this goes on, the greater the cost to the State.  Before Christmas, it was reported that Dublin City Council had spent \u20ac2 million on Priory Hall since the residents were evacuated.  That relates to the cost of short-term accommodation and the costs of securing a derelict building that should, at this stage, be knocked down.  I want to raise the issue with the Minister of State to ensure it continues to be a Government priority and, hopefully, to bring a greater sense of urgency to the resolution process.  Does the Minister of State have news to report and when we will finally see a solution for the residents of Priory Hall?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700021#U00800","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1360249200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Power for raising this matter and and for pursuing it.<\/p> <p>On behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, let me again acknowledge the stressful situation being faced by the Priory Hall residents who have been out of their homes for almost 16 months as the Senator has stated.  I share the wishes of all concerned who would like to see this matter resolved.  A Supreme Court hearing on an appeal by Dublin City Council against an order to pay for accommodation, storage and ancillary costs of residents forced to vacate their apartments at Priory Hall had been scheduled to take place on Tuesday, 24 April 2012, however on Friday, 20 April 2012, the Supreme Court agreed to adjourn these proceedings to allow for a conciliation process between the parties.  The conciliation process is being chaired by retired judge Mr. Justice Finnegan, former judge of the Supreme Court and president of the High Court, and provides an appropriate context for the parties concerned to work together towards identifying a way forward in relation to this complex problem.  Neither the Minister, Deputy Hogan, nor his Department are a party to the legal proceedings and have no direct role or involvement in relation to the conciliation process.  Out of respect for the process approved by the Supreme Court and for the retired Mr. Justice Finnegan, the Minister has consistently declined to make any comment on the matter other than to urge all stakeholders to engage fully with it and this remains his position.  No one at this point can anticipate the outcome of the process and it is important that all concerned now afford Mr. Justice Finnegan the opportunity to complete the task which he has been given. <\/p><p>Dublin City Council has made commendable efforts to provide for the needs of residents to date and continues to work proactively on behalf of the residents towards achieving the necessary and longed-for resolution of the issues at Priory Hall.  Dublin City Council remains committed to taking every reasonable step in its power to achieve this objective and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will continue to liaise closely with the council in this regard.<\/p><p>In particular the council, with the assistance of the Department, in consultation with NAMA, has secured alternative temporary accommodation for many of the residents.  The council, with some assistance from the Department, continues to bear the cost of such accommodation and has confirmed that it will continue to do so while the conciliation process is under way.<\/p><p>In the circumstances, I urge all concerned to allow Mr. Justice Finnegan the opportunity to complete the task he has been given.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700021#U00900","speaker":"1000","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360249800,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for being present in the House to give this reply.  I must take issue with the point made in the reply that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is not a party to the proceedings.  Yes, the Department is not directly a party to the proceedings but Dublin City Council is, and the Department is responsible to this House for the actions of the local authorities around the country, including Dublin City Council.<\/p><p>As I said, Dublin City Council has spent more than \u20ac2 million of taxpayers' money to date on short-term accommodation and on the security of the Priory Hall building.  If the council had risen to its responsibilities and accepted from the start that it had played a part in bringing this disaster about in the first place and engaged with the residents, this could have been avoided.  Instead it fought them through the courts and did everything possible to avoid being part of the solution to the problem.  The residents unanimously agreed to be part of the resolution process and see it as a very positive thing.  I agree that Mr. Justice Finnegan must be allowed to do his work but I take issue with the statement that the Department does not have a responsibility.  The Department has a responsibility to put pressure on Dublin City Council as a direct party to the resolution process to ensure it does everything it can to bring about a positive resolution.  Of course the banks are involved.  Of course this whole debacle is a result of the disgusting and unscrupulous practices of a particular developer as well.  However, I would like to see a more hands-on approach from the Government, because the Department is responsible for the Dublin City Council.  We passed legislation in this House at 6 a.m. this morning for the liquidation of IBRC and I understand that, as a consequence, Priory Hall will be under NAMA.  The Government has a relationship with NAMA and more pressure needs to be brought to bear on the State agencies involved to bring about a final solution as soon as possible to end this nightmare for the residents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013020700022#V00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1360249800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her contribution.
