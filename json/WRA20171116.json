This was our third meeting since my appointment. It was a constructive meeting at which we discussed the progress of negotiations to date.  I welcomed the progress that has been made in the areas of citizens&rsquo; rights and the Irish-specific issues.  However, it was clear that there are still many issues outstanding, not least on the issue of the financial settlement.<\/p>  <p>  In all of my meetings with Mr Barnier to date, I have laid particular emphasis on Ireland&rsquo;s objective of protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  I have strongly emphasised the need for an imaginative and flexible political solution.  In so doing, I have been equally clear that we will only pursue solutions that are compatible with our aim of protecting the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union and Ireland&rsquo;s place in them.  I conveyed this position again on 17 October, recognising that these priorities are reflected in the Commission Task Force&rsquo;s Guiding Principles paper of 7 September on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  I thanked Mr Barnier and his team for their hard work and the progress made on the Irish-specific issues, most notably with regard to the Common Travel Area.  We agreed that there is still a lot of work required on protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including sustaining North South cooperation and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  We are agreed that the Task Force&rsquo;s Guiding Principles on Ireland and Northern Ireland should form the basis of the firm political assurances and tangible commitments required from the UK in phase 1 future and the ultimate solutions on the Irish specific issues as part of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  We also discussed the issue of sufficient progress ahead of the October European Council. Mr Barnier informed me at that time that although progress had been made in the previous rounds of negotiations, he was not in a position to recommend to the European Council that sufficient progress had been made on all of the withdrawal issues to enable the negotiations to move to phase two.  While it had been hoped that the UK&rsquo;s position would be more advanced by October, Mr Barnier&rsquo;s position and the subsequent decision by the European Council not to advance to phase two, was not unexpected.<\/p>  <p>  I am hopeful that the sufficient progress required can be made in the negotiations in the coming weeks so that a decision can be taken by the European Council in December that discussions with the UK on future relationship issues, including on transitional arrangements, can begin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600044#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":8,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 9 to 12, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600044#WRA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[48419\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600044#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the prevalence of tied aid from various EU countries as a form of overseas development aid; his plans for Ireland to be a stronger voice in Europe on asserting that ODA be open, transparent and unconditional in view of Ireland's reputation as a country that does not put conditions on its aid programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>Ireland has consistently been recognized by the OECD Development Assistance Committee for the quality of our aid programme and the emphasis we place on achieving results for the poor, particularly in least developed countries.

EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Yemen last April, and called on the parties to start negotiating a peace agreement.  Ireland will continue to support the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed and his team in their work towards a peace agreement that is acceptable to all parties to the conflict. <\/p>  <p>  The war in Yemen is having increasingly devastating consequences for civilians.  I strongly condemn all attacks targeting civilians, in all circumstances, which are contrary to international humanitarian law.  There have been numerous such attacks in the Yemen conflict, causing great suffering.  I also condemn the recent missile attack on Riyadh on 4 November, which endangered the lives of ordinary people.  Such acts are unacceptable. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland takes the issue of humanitarian access extremely seriously.  The closure of land, air and sea ports earlier this month, including for the transit of humanitarian aid, was an alarming development.  When my officials last met with officials from the Saudi Embassy in Dublin last week, they stressed Ireland&rsquo;s condemnation of the missile attack on Riyadh, and also made clear the priority Ireland attaches to unfettered humanitarian access.  My officials relayed my request that all parties to the conflict do everything possible to facilitate the delivery of aid.  There have also been EU contacts with Saudi Arabia on this issue. <\/p>  <p>  I am encouraged by announcements by Saudi Arabia that it intends to allow the reopening of some ports and border crossings, which is an extremely necessary step.  I will continue to monitor this closely, and I take this opportunity to reiterate my call on all parties to the conflict to allow unrestricted humanitarian access to those in need.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has close economic ties with Saudi Arabia, and this relationship has considerable benefits for the Irish economy.  However, this partnership does not prevent us from raising our concerns in the appropriate channels.  My predecessor, Minister Flanagan, raised concerns about the appalling humanitarian situation in Yemen, and about attacks which have directly impacted on civilians, with the Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr Nizar bin Obaid Madani, in November 2016.  Following this, he also raised these concerns with the UAE Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, both in the UAE and more recently here in Dublin.  More recently, when senior officials from my Department met with the Saudi Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires last week, they reiterated these concerns, and re-stated Ireland&rsquo;s view that there can be no military solution to the crisis in Yemen. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy is underpinned by a set of values which include the protection of human rights, support for development, and the promotion of disarmament &ndash; values which Ireland champions and promotes in its interactions with all of our international partners irrespective of any trading relationships. <\/p>  <p>   All EU Member States have signed and ratified the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), the first legally binding instrument to regulate the international trade in conventional weapons.  States which sign up to the Treaty are prohibited from exporting arms to countries if they know those weapons will be used to commit gross violations of human rights.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the House that I will continue to take every appropriate opportunity to press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen and improved humanitarian access in the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600044#WRA02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sustainable Development Goals","counter":30,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600044#WRA02900"},{"type":"question","counter":31,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[48421\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600044#WRA03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the need for greater urgency in the implementation of the strategic development goals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":32,"content":"<p>The 2030 Agenda, with seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), was adopted by world leaders at the UN in 2015.

The Common Travel Area is an important feature of the close relationship Ireland enjoys with the UK, with long-established bilateral benefits which enable activity between Ireland and in the UK in many areas including, for example, in trade and tourism.  It means that Irish and British citizens can live, work, study, and access health, housing, welfare and pensions in each other&rsquo;s countries.  Importantly, it also underpins the citizenship provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.

The CTA pre-dates Irish and UK membership of the EU and is not dependent on EU membership.<\/p>  <p>  Work to maintain the Common Travel Area is ongoing.  The EU&rsquo;s Guidelines and Negotiating Directives clearly provide for the continuation of bilateral agreements and arrangements between the UK and Ireland which are compatible with EU law.

The latest actions taken by North Korea, particularly the nuclear test on 3 September, are a major challenge to international efforts to advance global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  This has been a longstanding goal of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy.<\/p>  <p>  Our leadership on this critical global issue was given most recent expression when Ireland co-chaired the 31st Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Plenary Meeting in Dublin in October.

Such actions represent a flagrant and provocative violation of North Korea&rsquo;s international obligations not to conduct such tests.  I have unreservedly condemned such actions.<\/p>  <p>  The government&rsquo;s concerns are shared by EU partners.  The Foreign Affairs Council adopted Council Conclusions on North Korea on 17 July this year.  The Council stressed that lasting peace and the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula must be achieved through peaceful means.  It highlighted the importance of the unity of the international community in addressing this challenge. <\/p>  <p>  On 16 October, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted new EU autonomous restrictive measures against North Korea to further increase pressure on the regime to comply with its obligations.  The measures complement and reinforce UN Security Council sanctions.  The Foreign Affairs Council also agreed to actively lobby for a robust implementation of all relevant UN Security Council resolutions on the part of all UN member states.<\/p>  <p>  The United Nations General Assembly in New York in September presented an opportunity for the international community to further demonstrate its resolve in this regard, and I conveyed Ireland&rsquo;s grave concern about ongoing developments.  In my address to the United Nations General Assembly, I unreservedly condemned North Korea&rsquo;s programme of missile and nuclear weapon testing.<\/p>  <p>  Most recently this resolve to implement the sanctions regime was re-affirmed by the European Council on 19 October, and a commitment was made to consider further responses in close consultation with partners. <\/p>  <p>  Throughout, we have been very clear in stating that North Korea must cease the series of provocative acts that have contributed to growing instability in the region and further afield.  It must re-engage with discussions on the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, immediately and without pre-conditions.  It must abandon its programmes to develop ballistic missiles, nuclear capabilities and weapons of mass destruction.  It must carry out these processes in a manner that is complete, verifiable and irreversible.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the international sanctions regime against North Korea, and emphasises that continued disregard of its international obligations will only lead to increased diplomatic isolation.  We believe greater emphasis should be placed on effective implementation of the sanctions regime, but further sanctions cannot be ruled out.<\/p>  <p>  The deteriorating situation on the Korean Peninsula can only be resolved by peaceful means, and we have repeatedly underscored the urgent need for dialogue between all stakeholders.

I have also advised the Secretary of State that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and I have emphasised the urgent need for a response from the British Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on the request in relation to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, and pursue all possible avenues that could achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600045#WRB03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Documents","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600045#WRB03700"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[48316\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600045#WRB03800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will publish all research conducted on the potential impact of Brexit by Government Departments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[44893\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600045#WRB03900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on the preparations within his Department for a hard Brexit and reports or analyses conducted in this regard.","asker":"1353","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 36 together.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade with special responsibility for Brexit, I have responsibility for coordinating the whole-of-Government response to Brexit.  In this capacity, I am working closely with colleagues across Government to address the many challenges resulting from Brexit.  This cooperation also involves the relevant State Agencies.<\/p>  <p>  Work at Cabinet level is being prepared through cross-Departmental coordination structures.  These represent a frequent and active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK. <\/p>  <p>  As the outcome of the negotiations is not yet known, an important focus of the planning and preparation being undertaken through these structures is on deepening the Government&rsquo;s analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios, including one in which no Withdrawal Agreement is concluded.  This represents an intensification of efforts to build on the Government&lsquo;s previous contingency planning.  <\/p>  <p>  Aside from its wider co-ordination responsibilities, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has lead responsibility for planning for, preparing positions on, and following the EU-UK negotiations.  This requires research on and analysis of very many legal, institutional, and political issues.  The eventual outcome of negotiations will of course be decisive in determining the shape and effects of Brexit.  This work is led by the European Union Division in co-operation with the Ireland and United Kingdom and Americas Division, the Legal Division, the Political Division and the Trade Division.  Our Permanent Representation in Brussels, and our Embassies in all Member States, send in a constant stream of reports describing and analysing the concerns and priorities of the EU Institutions and our partners.<\/p>  <p>  These work streams are reflected in the Government&rsquo;s policy positions and public statements, such as the comprehensive document on the Government&lsquo;s approach to the Article 50 negotiations and our response to Brexit which was published on 2 May as well as through in depth analysis such as the series the Department of Finance\/ERSI research papers on the implications of Brexit.  The Government will continue to consider how best to reflect the work ongoing across Government, in addition to the channels of public consultations and stakeholder engagement such as the All-Island Civic Dialogue and the Brexit Stakeholder Forum.  However, it would not be helpful or appropriate to publish detailed material which is heavily informed by confidential and ongoing analysis and discussions, including with other Member States and the EU Institutions. <\/p>  <p>  The Department is also analysing the possible impact of Brexit on policy areas within its remit, notably the EU&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy and the EU&rsquo;s policy on international development.<\/p>  <p>  We have already seen the implications that Brexit has had for our consular and passport services.  There has been a marked increase in demand for passports and citizenship via foreign birth registration from applicants in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  In this regard, the Passport Service in Dublin, Cork and London as well as Consular Division have recruited a number of additional temporary and fulltime officers to meet increased Passport and Foreign Birth Registration demands including increased demand as a result of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with the European Commission and European Parliament Offices here in Dublin and with civil society organisations including the Institute for International and European Affairs and European Movement Ireland.  With funding from this Department, the IIEA is undertaking research on the future shape of the EU and the new strategic alliances that Ireland will need to develop within the EU after Brexit.  The analysis will also consider the macro-economic effects of Brexit and the EU institutional implications of Britain&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  This work will build on the extensive analysis being undertaken by a range of organisations, both in Ireland and further afield, and will be presented in a series of public research papers over the coming months and years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600045#WRB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600045#WRB04100"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[40540\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600045#WRB04200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he or his officials have written to Ms Aung San Suu Kyi regarding Ireland's concerns about the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya people in Myanmar.","asker":"1360","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>This Government remains deeply concerned about the ongoing situation in Rakhine State, Myanmar, in particular the treatment of the Rohingya people.

Phase 1 is focusing on the exit issues of citizen&rsquo;s rights, the financial settlement and the Irish specific issues.  Once the European Council has agreed that sufficient progress has been made on these issues, the negotiations can move into phase 2 and parallel discussions on a framework for a future EU-UK relationship and on a transitional arrangements.  Ireland fully supports this phased approach.  This phased approach was also agreed by the UK in the first round of negotiations on 19 June.<\/p>  <p>  The Negotiating Directives, based on the European Council Guidelines and as agreed by the EU27 at the General Affairs Council in May 2017, provide a formal mandate for the European Commission negotiating team, led by Michel Barnier, for the Article 50 Negotiations.  The European Council can revise its guidelines when necessary as the negotiations proceed and move into phase two.  Any additional or revised European Council Guidelines may subsequently require a revision, as agreed by the Council, to the more detailed negotiating directives.<\/p>  <p>  At its meeting on 20 October, the European Council welcomed the progress made in the EU-UK negotiations to date but agreed that further work is needed before it can agree that sufficient progress has been made on all of the exit issues to enable discussions on the framework for a future EU-UK relationship and transitional arrangements to begin.  Decisions on sufficient progress will be made collectively by the Heads of State and Government of EU27.  In that respect, I welcome the call by the European Council for work in the negotiations to continue, and its commitment to reassess progress at its next meeting on 14-15 December.<\/p>  <p>  Once sufficient progress has been made by the UK on all of the exit issues, additional guidelines will be agreed by the European Council on the framework for a future relationship and possible transitional arrangements.

This was a positive acknowledgement of the UK&rsquo;s constructive approach to the Article 50 negotiations as reflected in Prime Minister May&rsquo;s speech in Florence on 22 September and an indication the EU is willing and ready to begin phase 2 once sufficient progress has been achieved.  While the existing Guidelines include elements on these Phase 2 issues, I expect that they will need to be adjusted and expanded as negotiations in that phase begin.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains hopeful that, with hard work and political will, progress can be made in negotiations in coming weeks so that decision can be taken by European Council at its meeting in December that parallel phase 2 discussions on future relationship and possible transitional arrangements can begin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600045#WRB04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":81,"content":"<p>Question No. 40 answered with Question No. 12.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":82,"content":"<p>Question No. 41 answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600046#WRC00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Data","counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600046#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":85,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[48516\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600046#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of businesses engaged in cross-Border trade with Northern Ireland; the number of persons employed by these businesses; and the value of this trade in 2015, in tabular form.","asker":"1327","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":86,"content":"<p>The total value of goods exported from this jurisdiction to Northern Ireland in 2015 was &euro;1.73bn. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Details on the number of businesses involved in this cross-border trade can be estimated by reference to the EU's system for collecting statistics on the movement of goods between\u00a0its Member States.

A new single body of first instance called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) was created from 1 October 2015 and a separate appeals body, which is effectively an expanded Labour Court.<\/p>  <p>  The WRC incorporates the functions of the Labour Relations Commission (including the Rights Commissioner Service), the Equality Tribunal, the Employment Appeals Tribunal (first instance jurisdiction only), and the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  The Labour Court is now the sole appellate body for disputes under employment rights enactments.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 Act sets out in the Schedules to that Act a comprehensive list of the employment and equality legislation that the WRC is statutorily entitled to operate under.  There is a broad suite of employment rights and equality legislation in place and complainants can make a complaint to the WRC under the various enactments for adjudication.  The Act allows that either party may appeal a decision of an Adjudication Officer of the WRC to the Labour Court.  <\/p>  <p>  Adjudication Officers of the WRC are statutorily independent in exercising their decision making functions under the extensive suite of employment and equality legislation but will of course be subject to the underlying provisions and any limitations imposed by the specific legislation.  For instance, under Unfair Dismissals legislation, an employee must, as a general rule, be employed for a year with the particular employer before a claim can be taken under that legislation.  Should an individual seek a remedy under legislation that falls outside the remit of the WRC, of course this would fall outside the jurisdiction of an adjudication officer of the WRC.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of industrial relations legislation, a dispute as defined in the Industrial Relations Acts may also be referred to the WRC under Section 13 of the Industrial Relations Act 1969.  This is subject to both parties being agreeable to the case being heard by the WRC.

A consequence of getting such an Order from the Court was that the company concerned retained an exemption from audit. <\/p>  <p>  Section 343(7) replaced a previous scheme whereby a company could apply to the Registrar of Companies for its late filing fees to be waived.  A consequence of getting such a waiver from the Registrar was the company lost the audit exemption as it was still late filing its annual return. <\/p>  <p>  Section 343(7) was commenced on 1 June 2015. The number of Orders granted by the District Court in the course of 2016 was more than double the number of waivers granted by the Registrar in 2014 under the previous scheme.  This is a matter for concern as the timely filing of annual returns and financial statements by companies is an important transparency measure and safeguard for third parties such as suppliers, employees and other creditors.  Companies have up to 10 months to prepare and file their financial statements.  Any further delay risks making that information less meaningful to those third parties. <\/p>  <p>  For this reason, section 9 of the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017 repeals section 343(7) and section 10 of the Bill replaces that repealed subsection with a new section 343A, to be inserted into the Companies Act 2014.  The new section 343A provides that a company may apply to the District Court for an Order waiving the fee required for the late filing of its annual return.

This provides independent assurance that the appointee is of sufficient calibre and quality to add significant value to the work of the relevant board.<\/p><p>My predecessor as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform issued Guidelines on Appointments to State Boards in November 2014 setting out clearly how the new appointments process would work in practice. <\/p><p>In terms of the specific objective of increasing the participation of women on State Boards, the Government agreed to set a target of 40% female membership of such boards and that where a board met the 40% target that the aim should be to increase to 45%. <\/p><p>A database maintained by my Department on State Board Appointments (available at www.StateBoards.ie) shows that steady progress is being made on increasing female participation.  Some 40% of all board members are now female, although this percentage obviously varies from Board to Board. <\/p><p>Indications are that 48% of State Boards have reached the target of a minimum of 40% female membership set by the Government and indeed that some 35% of boards have met the higher 45% target.  This compares very favourably with the private sector, with a figure of somewhere around 13% female participation.  The position on individual State Boards is a matter for the relevant Minister.<\/p><p>Up to the end of September this year, over 500 appointments have been made under the new system.\u00a0\u00a0Some 30% of the applications received for state board appointment came from women, who made up some 45% of the appointments made by Ministers. <\/p><p>As I mentioned, each Minister is ultimately responsible for appointments to boards under their aegis and must have regard to the Guidelines.  Relevant issues relating to the effective operation of each board, including those such as diversity, gender balance and mix of expertise are for each Minister to consider.  Personally I would encourage all Ministers, through their Departments, to encourage measures to increase awareness of State Boards in their sectors with the particular aim of increasing applications from women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600047#WRD05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gender Balance","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600047#WRD05400"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[48569\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600047#WRD05500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the gender balance on each of the State boards under his remit, in tabular form.","asker":"1239","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":193,"content":"<p>The Public Appointments Service (PAS) is the only State Board under my remit.

This is a substantial allocation of hours for a school of this size. <\/p><p>Whereas the profiled allocation had indicated a need of 40 hours for this school, based on its school profile and size, and relative to the profiled needs of all other schools, the school was allocated 42.05 hours, which was equivalent to the allocation the school received in 2016\/17. <\/p><p>There has therefore been no reduction to the allocation of special educational needs teaching support for this school.<\/p><p>Under the new allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p><p>Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.<\/p><p>It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile.  Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations. <\/p><p>Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.<\/p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.<\/p><p>In March of this year, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published details of an appeal process for schools. <\/p><p>Schools were advised that this appeal would consider circumstances where schools considered that their school profile was calculated incorrectly, using the data set out in DES Circulars 0013 and 0014 2017.  An appeal could be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. <\/p><p>Schools who wished to submit an appeal on this basis were asked to do so by March 31st 2017.  These appeals have been processed and this appeal process has now concluded. <\/p><p>A second process has been put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.<\/p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in DES Circular 17\/2017 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) and DES 10,11,12\/2017 (Post Primary School Staffing Schedule).<\/p><p>Schools who qualified of additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualified for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. <\/p><p>Schools were also advised that it acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. <\/p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.<\/p><p>The NCSE has now published details of how schools can seek a review of their allocations, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  <\/p><p>Should a school consider they fulfil the criteria for a review on the grounds of exceptional circumstances, they may request such a review at: <\/p><p>Finally, with regards to mainstream teaching posts, the criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts is published annually on my Departments website.

We are successfully filling the posts that we are making available.<\/p>  <p>  However, I am\u00a0aware that some schools have experienced difficulty in recruiting adequately qualified teachers in particular subjects, including Irish, and I am committed to examining all possible means of addressing this issue.  My Department has been made aware of the case of the school referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  I have taken certain initiatives to address some of the supply pressures in particular subjects.  These include, as part of the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education, increasing from 2018\/19 the number of places available on the existing Irish medium post primary initial teacher education programme in NUIG, to which I have granted two additional posts from September 2017.  This measure will strengthen the Irish-language proficiency of newly qualified teachers across a range of subjects and, it is anticipated, also increase the supply of Irish language teachers.<\/p>  <p>  I have also undertaken measures to increase the pool of teachers available to schools, in particular to fill short term vacancies.  My Department informed all teachers retiring in 2017 that in order to remain eligible for employment in a state funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days or to supervise the State examinations, a teacher must maintain his\/her registration with the Teaching Council.

The Deputy will appreciate that there are difficulties in developing a reliable model of teacher supply at second level and this was recognised in the work of the Teaching Council as teaching is competing with many other sectors for graduates in areas like Maths, Science, and Irish. \u00a0The Teaching Council, which has an advisory role in this matter, recently convened a consultative forum on teacher supply with relevant stakeholders with the aim of producing teacher supply proposals and I look forward to seeing the report from this forum which will further inform our thinking in this matter.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am currently reviewing with my Department other potential initiatives on teacher supply.

It makes clear that it is the UK&rsquo;s responsibility to propose workable solutions and take the policy decisions required to deliver on the shared objective of avoiding the border.  The Government fully supports this paper.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the UK&rsquo;s commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining the Common Travel area and avoiding &ldquo;any physical infrastructure at the border&rdquo;.  While I acknowledge the sincerity of this commitment, the EU has made it clear that it needs to be backed up with workable solutions that consider fully the complexities presented by the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  In committing to concrete plans to avoid a hard border, the UK must also take account of and comprehensively address the risks presented by any regulatory divergence from the rules of the EU Internal Market and Customs Union. <\/p>  <p>  The Government remains of the view that any solution to the border issue will, first and foremost, need to be political.  Flexible and imaginative solutions will be required to avoid a hard border which not only address the economic challenges but also take account of the societal challenges and how important the current invisible border is for sustaining the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.  This is about ensuring that people&rsquo;s lives and livelihoods are protected and that communities and businesses in the border region are given every opportunity to develop and prosper.<\/p>  <p>  Planning is ongoing across Government to prepare for all possible scenarios, including in the event of no deal being reached, but we are not at the cliff edge yet.  The focus remains on working with our EU partners and the UK in seeking an orderly withdrawal, that protects the peace process, avoids a hard border, maintains the Common Travel Area and secures a transitional arrangement that leads to the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK.  This will be a long and complex process and an outcome is far from determined.  The Government remains hopeful that the sufficient progress required can be made in the coming weeks before the next meeting of the European Council on 14-15 December that could enable it to decide to move onto phase 2 and the parallel discussions on a framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK and on transitional arrangements.

It was clear well in advance that it would not be possible for the EU&rsquo;s Chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to recommend that sufficient progress has been made.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the call by the European Council for work in the negotiations to continue, and its commitment to reassess progress at its next meeting in December.  The EU has been clear on what is expected from the UK in phase 1 and now is the time for the UK to make the necessary commitments across all three exit issues. <\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the European Council also agreed to begin internal preparatory discussions on priorities for the future framework for the EU-UK future relationship, and for transitional arrangements.  The aim of such discussions, which began at official level last week, is to ensure that the EU is ready to begin phase 2 negotiations with the UK as soon has sufficient progress has been recorded.  This should be seen not just as prudent preparation but as a signal of goodwill.<\/p>  <p>  There was some progress on citizens&rsquo; rights during the negotiating round of 9\/10 November.  More work needs to be done but we note the Task Force&rsquo;s view that the UK has provided useful clarifications that are a good basis for further work.  There is however significantly more work to be done on the issue of the financial settlement, where more detail is needed from the UK as to how it will honour its commitments, as promised by the Prime Minister in her Florence speech in September.<\/p>  <p>  On the Irish specific issues, the support of our EU partners for finding solutions to the unique challenges facing the island of Ireland has been strong and consistent throughout this process.  The basis of the EU&rsquo;s position remains as set out in the European Council Guidelines of 29 April and the Task Force&rsquo;s Guiding Principles paper of 7 September.  The EU&rsquo;s approach to this week&rsquo;s round of negotiations has not departed from this, but has built upon it. <\/p>  <p>  Overall, more needs to be done before the December European Council.  We do not underestimate the challenges ahead but the Government remains hopeful that, with hard work and political will, sufficient progress can be made in the intervening period.

The issues under discussion &ndash; particularly those on language and culture &ndash; go to the heart of the divisions in society in Northern Ireland and agreement on them was always going to be challenging.  <\/p>  <p>  I have always believed that it remains possible to reach an honourable compromise which ensures implementation of previous agreements and reflects the core principles of the Good Friday Agreement and power-sharing itself - partnership, equality and mutual respect.  It remains my conviction that this is achievable.<\/p>  <p>  I maintain regular engagement on behalf of the Government with civic society across all communities and regions in Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach and other Government Ministers also visits Northern Ireland on a regular basis.  There is in addition extensive engagement, North and South, through the Government&rsquo;s ongoing All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  All of the Government&rsquo;s engagement with civic society in Northern Ireland, confirms our view that there is an urgent need and demand for the effective operation of the power-sharing Executive and Assembly, to deliver representative and accountable devolved Government, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement and as mandated by the public in the last Assembly election.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of a Budget Bill for Northern Ireland at Westminster this week is a significant development for the political process in Northern Ireland, founded on the Good Friday Agreement.  A budget for Northern Ireland is a matter that should be considered and decided on by the power-sharing Executive and Assembly. <\/p>  <p>  As there is no Executive in place at present, the necessary budgetary decisions cannot be made by the devolved institutions.  In the meantime, a statutory basis for the continued funding of public services in Northern Ireland is required. <\/p>  <p>  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has confirmed that the Budget Bill reflects the advice of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, and has not been subject to political decision-making outside of Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  I would acknowledge that this step has been taken by the British Government with reluctance and at the latest possible stage in order to seek to preserve the role of the devolved institutions to decide on budgetary and other matters within their responsibility when they are operating again.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to clearly affirm that the Good Friday Agreement remains the indispensable framework for relationships within Northern Ireland, on the island of Ireland and between the UK and Ireland.  The Government has confirmed that this week, as has the British Government.<\/p>  <p>  In the event that the devolved institutions cannot function, it is the responsibility of the British and Irish Governments to ensure that the North\/South and East-West institutions of the Agreement can continue to operate effectively and in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has consistently affirmed our unwavering commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and determination, as a co-guarantor of the Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.

The conflict has entered its third year, the political process has stalled and the fighting is having devastating consequences for civilians.  This conflict has been characterised by allegations of violations of human rights, massive starvation and disease, and infringements of international humanitarian law.<\/p>  <p>  Seven million Yemenis are on the brink of famine, including approximately two million severely malnourished children.  In addition, Yemen has experienced a surge in cholera cases since April, with almost one million suspected cases and over two thousand associated deaths according to the World Health Organization.<\/p>  <p>  The only way to bring about a long-term sustainable improvement in the situation for the Yemeni people is through peaceful resolution of the conflict.  Ireland is working, including though the EU and UN, to support efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the conflict, to investigate and prosecute alleged violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and to support the humanitarian needs of the Yemeni people. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed and his team, who are working towards a peace agreement that is acceptable to all parties to the conflict.  I welcome the Special Envoy&rsquo;s announcement following his meeting with senior Yemeni and Saudi officials last month, of the steps that are currently being explored.  These include: reinstating the cessation of hostilities, confidence building measures on the humanitarian side, and the return to the negotiating table.<\/p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers last discussed the situation in Yemen at the Foreign Affairs Council in April.  The Council called on the parties to start negotiating a peace agreement, and committed to increasing its engagement with Yemen once a political solution to the conflict is agreed.  The EU is the largest humanitarian donor to Yemen and has provided over &euro;170 million in aid since the conflict began, to which Ireland contributes via the EU Development Budget. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland has also contributed over &euro;10 million in humanitarian assistance from our Aid Programme since 2015.  This includes our commitment made in April to provide &euro;4 million to the UN Humanitarian Fund for Yemen, which provides rapid and flexible funding to NGOs and UN agencies for health, water and sanitation, and nutrition. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is also providing &euro;20 million annually for 2016-2018 to the UN World Food Programme which is active in providing food assistance in Yemen.  In addition, Ireland is the 8th largest contributor to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated $84.8 million to Yemen since 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is also working through the UN system to address the human rights situation in Yemen.  At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland was part of a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption of a Resolution on Yemen.  This Resolution established a group of international experts to examine allegations of human rights violations of human rights during the conflict, and to report back to the UN Human Rights Council next year.  This investigation is an important step towards accountability in Yemen, and will help establish the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground. <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to take every appropriate opportunity to press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict, respect for human rights and international humanitarian law and improved humanitarian access going forward. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600049#WRF00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disaster Response","counter":265,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600049#WRF00900"},{"type":"question","counter":266,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[48662\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600049#WRF01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which humanitarian abuse, war and starvation has been noted by the international community at various locations globally to date; the extent to which aid is directed at such locations; the efficacy of this aid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":267,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[48664\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600049#WRF01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the degree to which the international community is geared to respond to various disasters globally from natural disasters to war; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":268,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 107 together. <\/p>  <p>  The international community is currently challenged by the scale of humanitarian crises globally resulting from war, conflict, drought, famine and natural disasters.  Over 145 million people in 39 countries around the world are now in need of urgent humanitarian assistance.  The UN estimates that a record $24.1 billion is needed this year to respond effectively to these needs. <\/p>  <p>  The UN has identified the emergencies in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and the Democratic Republic of the Congo as particularly complex crises in conflict situations which have resulted in significant displacement, food insecurity, rising malnutrition levels and serious concerns for the protection of civilians.  Coordinated responses from the international community are required in order to deal effectively with complex crises such as these.<\/p>  <p>  Despite a huge gap between the total requirements of the UN-coordinated appeals and the funding received, the international community&rsquo;s coordinated response can and is working.  For example, the international community provided more than $2.4 billion in humanitarian support this year to address the four famines then threatening more than 20 million people across South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria and Yemen.  While a severe threat remains, the relief efforts coordinated by the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) saved lives and alleviated imminent famine.  Ireland provided &euro;2.9 million in core funding this year to OCHA. Such funding not only supports OCHA&rsquo;s core function of coordination of humanitarian response, but enables it to manage a number of UN humanitarian pooled fund mechanisms including the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).  Ireland is a strong supporter of this mechanism, which enables the quick provision of funding to humanitarian responders whenever and wherever crises hit.  Ireland is the sixth largest donor to the CERF in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  To respond effectively and in a timely manner to the unprecedented level of demands facing the international community, Ireland provided more than &euro;194 million for humanitarian assistance in 2016.  Our assistance is focused on where needs are greatest, providing support to the most vulnerable and hard to reach populations.  We remain committed to responding in a timely and effective manner to the most severe humanitarian crises and emergencies, in particular to protracted and forgotten crises.  However, we recognise that the provision of humanitarian aid alone is not the answer.  Humanitarian need will continue to rise unless durable solutions are found to the conflicts driving the great majority of humanitarian crises.  Ireland will focus our efforts on supporting the international system to find peaceful political solutions to war and violence.  At the same time, we will continue to work to ensure faster and more effective delivery of humanitarian aid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600049#WRF01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":269,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600049#WRF01300"},{"type":"question","counter":270,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[48663\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600049#WRF01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the degree to which the incidents of war, ethnic cleansing, human rights abuses and the use of child soldiers continue in the Horn of Africa; if direct or indirect international aid is having a positive impact; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":271,"content":"<p>I am deeply concerned at ongoing incidents of conflict and violence in the Horn of Africa.

This is about ensuing that people&rsquo;s lives and livelihoods are protected and that communities and businesses in the border region are given every opportunity to develop and prosper.  Any solution must respect the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union and Ireland&rsquo;s place in them and must not anticipate the outcome of the wider discussions on the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.<\/p>  <p>  It is therefore the Government&rsquo;s view that the UK staying in the Customs Union and Single Market, or the closest possible arrangement to that, would be the best solution to avoid a hard border on the island.  Failing that, Northern Ireland should continue to enjoy the benefits of the Customs Union and the Single Market, of course with all the rights and obligations that would come with that.  If the UK continues to rule out this option, the solutions that it offers must be concrete and workable and must achieve the shared objective of protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  Now is the time for the UK to provide strong political assurances and tangible commitments, which must also take account of and comprehensively address the risks presented by any regulatory divergence from the rules of the EU Internal Market and Customs Union. <\/p>  <p>  My officials and I will continue to work very closely with Michel Barnier and his team to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s positions continue to be fully reflected in the negotiations.

This requires research on and analysis of very many legal, institutional, and political issues.  Within my Department, this work is led by the European Union Division in co-operation with the Ireland and United Kingdom and Americas Division, the Legal Division, the Political Division and the Trade Division.  Our Permanent Representation in Brussels, and our Embassies in all Member States, send in a constant stream of reports describing and analysing the concerns and priorities of the EU Institutions and our partners.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also analysing the possible impact of Brexit on policy areas within its remit, notably the EU&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy and the EU&rsquo;s policy on international development.<\/p>  <p>  We have already seen the implications that Brexit has had for our consular and passport services.  There has been a marked increase in demand for passports and citizenship via foreign birth registration from applicants in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  In this regard, the Passport Service in Dublin, Cork and London as well as Consular Division have recruited a number of additional temporary and fulltime officers to meet increased Passport and Foreign Birth Registration demands including increased demand as a result of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with the European Commission and European Parliament Offices here in Dublin and with civil society organisations including the Institute for International and European Affairs and European Movement Ireland.  With funding from this Department, the IIEA is undertaking research on the future shape of the EU and the new strategic alliances that Ireland will need to develop within the EU after Brexit.  The analysis will also consider the macro-economic effects of Brexit and the EU institutional implications of Britain&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  This work will build on the extensive analysis being undertaken by a range of organisations, both in Ireland and further afield, and will be presented in a series of public research papers over the coming months and years.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding all this ongoing analysis, preparation and contingency planning, the Government is already actively responding to the implications of Brexit and putting measures in place to mitigate the adverse effects for Ireland.  Significant measures were announced in Budget 2018 including increased funding for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which will, among other things, support the opening of six new diplomatic missions as part of Global Footprint 2025 to help our exporters find new markets and diversity their exports. <\/p>  <p>  We are not under any illusions about the complexity of Brexit and the EU-UK negotiations but the Government remains hopeful that progress can be made in the negotiations in the coming weeks so that a decision can be taken by European Council at its meeting in December to allow for parallel phase 2 discussions on future relationship and possible transitional arrangements to begin.  Ireland will continue to work closely with the Commission Task Force to advance these issues in the negotiations with the UK. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600049#WRF03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":292,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600049#WRF03600"},{"type":"question","counter":293,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[48673\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600049#WRF03700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the smaller version of Irish passports approved some time ago have been acceptable and popular for international travel; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":294,"content":"<p>The Passport Card was launched in October 2015 and since then over 73,000 cards have been issued to Irish citizens across the world.<\/p><p>An application for the card can be made online via my Department&rsquo;s website www.dfa.ie.<\/p><p>The Passport Card can be used by Irish citizens for travel to 31 countries in total including the EU\/EEA and Switzerland.

Section 9 lays down the fundamental principle on which the Bill is founded, that information in electronic form cannot be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability merely on the basis that it is in electronic form.  A number of areas of our laws to which it is proposed the Bill will not initially apply are outlined in section 10.  Laws governing the registration of immovable property, wills, trusts and enduring powers of attorney are excluded because it is felt the technology and systems are not yet at a stage where they could cope with the execution of such transactions electronically.  These areas are excluded only for the time being.  Once it is appropriate to extend the legislation to these areas, the Minister of the day has the power to make regulations to extend the application of the legislation to them.&quot;<\/p><p>It is clear, therefore, that exclusions from the scope of the Act\u00a0are not intended to be permanent.  However, any extension of the Act to excluded areas or subjects must have regard to\u00a0the need for\u00a0safeguards\u00a0against fraud and impersonation.  This applies in particular to situations in which the signature of witnesses is currently required.\u00a0<\/p><p>In light of the foregoing, it is clear that any future extension of the scope of the Electronic Commerce Act will\u00a0necessitate a comprehensive consultation process involving all relevant stakeholders.  Responsibility for launching such a process lies, in the first instance, with\u00a0the relevant Minister and Department, i.e. the Minister and Department of Communications, Climate Act and Environment as the holders of responsibility for the relevant area of the former Minister and Department\u00a0for Public Enterprise.  I can, of course, confirm that my Department is willing to engage in any such consultations.  I would also encourage and expect that other important statutory and non-statutory stakeholders, including\u00a0the Courts Service and the legal and business communities,\u00a0to contribute\u00a0to such a consultation\u00a0process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600050#WRG01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":326,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600050#WRG01800"},{"type":"question","counter":327,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[48511\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600050#WRG01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number and position of garda&iacute; and community garda&iacute; stationed in Dublin metropolitan region west in each of the years 2009 to 2016, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":328,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

It introduced a requirement to provide nutrition labelling on pre-packaged foods - that is a declaration of the energy value, and the amounts of fat, saturates, carbohydrate, sugars, protein and salt contained in such products.<\/p>  <p>  The regulation also provides that EU Member States can recommend the use within their own territory of a voluntary scheme which provides for additional forms of expression or presentation of nutrition information for specified nutrients, once the proposed scheme meets certain criteria.  <\/p>  <p>  The French Nutri-Score system is one such voluntary national scheme.  Given that it is a voluntary scheme, there is no obligation that products from Ireland which are sent to France should conform to this scheme.  Moreover, it is a requirement of the FIC Regulation that the application of such a scheme must not create obstacles to the free movement of goods within the EU.

The use of this type of equipment is supported under the GLAS scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Nitrogen is now more efficiently used through improved manure management and soil fertility.  The Nitrates Action Programme helps in this regard and contains measures to protect surface waters and ground water from agricultural sources. <\/p>  <p>  The above are just some of the measures being undertaken, however, policy interventions must be optimised by well-informed scientific research.  In this regard my Department has invested heavily in climate change actions through our own Research Funding Programmes which of course complement Teagasc activities in this area.  It is through this continued investment in and engagement with research initiatives that the sector will continue to make progress in reducing GHGs that are associated with agricultural production. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600053#WRK01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Negotiations","counter":501,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600053#WRK01900"},{"type":"question","counter":502,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[48633\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600053#WRK02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of a joint EU-UK proposal to the WTO on the way to deal with import arrangements for agricultural goods such as meat, sugar and grains post-Brexit, with the UK maintaining a portion of the EU&rsquo;s quotas based on the UK&rsquo;s average consumption over the past few years; and his views on the rejection of this proposal by other countries at WTO level.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":503,"content":"<p>In a letter dated 11 October 2017, the EU and UK jointly notified the other members of the WTO of the need to make adjustments to the EU's existing quantitative commitments in the area of goods.\u00a0 The UK advised that it intends to replicate, as far as possible, its obligations under the current EU commitments.\u00a0 In the letter\u00a0the EU and UK proposed that the EU's quantitative commitments in relation to tariff rate quotas (TRQ) be apportioned on the basis of existing\u00a0trade flows.\u00a0 It sought a common approach on data sets and methodology with WTO partners.

I invited contributions from members of the forum on developing these initiatives and how they could best be delivered. \u00a0I will be inviting stakeholders to a future meeting of the High Level Implementation Committee of Food Wise 2025 to present on the more important of these initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 is of course the blueprint for the development of the agri-food sector as a whole, including the tillage sector.  This document contains a number of priority actions to support the development of the tillage sector.  My own Department implements a number of these actions.<\/p>  <p>  For example, in order to increase the availability of native grown protein crops for inclusion in animal feeds, a protein aid scheme was introduced in 2015, as part of the implementation of the reformed CAP package in Ireland.  &euro;3 million was set aside annually for this scheme and the rate of payment in 2016 was &euro;246\/ha.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In July of this year in response to the exceptionally challenging harvest conditions of September 2016 I introduced the Weather Related Crop Loss Support measure to assist farmers who experienced significant yield losses in spring cereal crops. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I introduced the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme in January of this year and extended it to cover the tillage and horticulture sectors.  All the finance available under this scheme has been committed and is in the process of being drawn down.  There has been a very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, including tillage farmers. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this support I secured funding of &euro;25 million for my Department to facilitate the development of a new Brexit response loan scheme for farmers, fishermen and food businesses in 2018.  Further details will be announced in due course.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As a further support to tillage farmers I introduced the\u00a0Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II earlier this year.\u00a0 The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.\u00a0 There is a significant level of interest in investments under this measure with a total number of 687 applications received.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I secured an increase from 50% to 70% advance payment on 16 October last of the 2017 Basic Payment Scheme and Greening payments from the European Commission.  This approach was prompted by the market difficulties being experienced in several sectors including tillage arising from ongoing currency fluctuations and protracted poor weather conditions.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, my Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the level of production, quality and viability of the Irish cereal sector.  These services include seed certification, seed testing, crop variety testing and the publication of recommended lists of varieties, research funding through the &lsquo;Stimulus&rsquo; competitive research programme and funding for the quality assurance scheme.  In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for tillage producers.  The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereals producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the range of current supports, I will continue to closely engage with the tillage sector on its needs, particularly through the Tillage Stakeholders Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600053#WRK03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Live Exports","counter":513,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600053#WRK03100"},{"type":"question","counter":514,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[48637\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600053#WRK03200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to ensure calf exports are not held up due to the main ferry boat involved being taken off the Ireland to France route for repairs in 2018 (details supplied).","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":515,"content":"<p>My Department is aware that the regular Rosslare Cherbourg\u00a0ferry\u00a0will\u00a0not be\u00a0operating its usual\u00a0journeys\u00a0 for a period of 4 weeks in February\/March 2018\u00a0as it will be in dry dock for refurbishment during this time.\u00a0 This would, unless taken up by other providers, reduce ferry capacity for the transport of a range of product, including animals, from Ireland by sea for the period in question. <\/p>  <p>  The Department is aware that discussions are on-going with the company concerned, and other companies, with regard to various options to cover this period and continues to actively\u00a0monitor the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600053#WRK03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry","counter":516,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600053#WRK03400"},{"type":"question","counter":517,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[48647\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600053#WRK03500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if there is an immediate emergency compensation scheme for fishermen to recoup the cost of storm damage other than the mutual fund for adverse climatic events and environmental incidents;

Funding of just under &euro;4.27m has been allocated to organisations specifically providing services to sexual violence victims this year.<\/p>  <p>  Rape crisis centres offer counselling  and therapy to victims of sexual violence. Counselling services can experience increase in demand from time to time, creating longer waiting lists. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware, in this regard, that particular pressures were being experienced in the Dublin are. In order to alleviate pressures, Tusla provided additional funding of &euro;44,000 in 2017 to put Dublin Rape Crisis Centre's core services on a more sustainable footing and to resource additional counselling hours to reduce waiting lists and waiting times for services. Tusla was informed that the waiting list situation had improved as a result of the additional counselling resources provided. <\/p>  <p>  Arising from Budget 2018, I will shortly be issuing Tusla with its Performance Statement for 2018 in line with the provisions of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013. Tusla will, in response to the Performance Statement, prepare a Business Plan for 2018 which will be submitted to me for consideration.<\/p>  <p>  The precise level of funding to be allocated to Rape Crisis Centres will be considered by Tusla, in preparing its Business Plan, having regard to the overall level of funding available in 2018, which will exceed &euro;753m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600055#WRM04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gender Balance","counter":638,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600055#WRM04400"},{"type":"question","counter":639,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[48558\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600055#WRM04500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the gender balance on each of the State boards under her remit in tabular form.","asker":"1239","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":640,"content":"<p>I am responsible for the appointment of members to the boards of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Child and Family Agency (Tusla), Gaisce (the President&rsquo;s Award) and the Board of Management for Oberstown Children Detention Campus. <\/p><p>The following table sets out the information requested by the Deputy. <table><tr><th>State Board<\/th><th>Number of positions on each Board<\/th><th>Positions Currently Filled<\/th><th>Number of Women on Board<\/th><th>Percentage of Women on Board<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI)<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>57%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gaisce<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>53%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Oberstown Children Detention Campus<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>38%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Child and Family Agency (Tusla)<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>44%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600055#WRM04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":642,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600055#WRM04800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dog Breeding Industry","counter":641,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600055#WRM04700"},{"type":"question","counter":642,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[48457\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600055#WRM04800","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"when the dog breeding establishment guideline review will be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":643,"content":"<p>The regulation of Dog Breeding Establishments (DBE) is a matter for each local authority in whose functional area the establishment is located.

The process for registering and using a verified MyGovID account proves in the online environment that the person has had their identity verified to the SAFE 2 standard. As part of the application of the SAFE 2 standard in the online environment, my Department seeks to ensure that a person&rsquo;s MyGovID account is not used by another person. This is vital to ensure that a personal data is only made available to the correct person and that data protection requirements are satisfied. This is done by employing two-factor authentication each time the person uses the account. Two-factor authentication is an industry standard mechanism for authenticating users of high-value online services. This means that, in addition to requesting a username and password (things they know), a one-time verification code is sent to the person&rsquo;s verified mobile phone (something they have) which they must also provide when logging in.
