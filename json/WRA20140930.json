However, receipts from the UK which were profiled for November  were actually received in September; when this is excluded, a net current deficit of &euro;432m emerges.<\/p><p>  In income and expenditure terms the HSE is reporting a year to date net expenditure of &euro;7.039 billion to the end of July against a budget of &euro;6.754 billion, leading to a variance of &euro;285 million. The acute hospital sector accounts for &euro;160m or 57% of the overall deficit. Employment agency costs were &euro;194m, up &euro;63m on last year, a significant element of which was incurred in acute hospital services. The Primary Care Division had an overall deficit of &euro;54m with local demand-led schemes a key area experiencing excess expenditure.<\/p><p>  Undoubtedly, 2014 is proving to be a financially challenging year for the health services.  While the budgetary targets this year are particularly constrained, it is important to recognise that very demanding financial and resource constraints have applied in each of the last number of years as a direct consequence of the crisis in the public finances.  The cumulative impact of this unprecedented period of financial and resource restraint has resulted in reductions in the health service budget of the order of &euro;1.5 billion since 2008 with numbers employed reduced by over 14,000 over this period. <\/p><p>  These challenges come at a time when the demand for health services is increasing each year which, in turn, is driving costs upwards. Despite these resource reductions the HSE has managed to support growing demand for its services arising from such factors as population growth, increased levels of chronic disease, the ageing of the population, increased demand for prescription drugs, and new costly medical technologies and treatments. <\/p><p>  Currently it is anticipated that a supplementary estimate above &euro;500 million will be required to support services in 2014. This is based on costs to the end of July and takes account of the HSE&rsquo;s best estimate of likely expenditure to year end, mitigated by ongoing cost containment plans and income generation. It is important to stress that, as with any forecast, there is some degree of uncertainty particularly given the scale of the overall HSE cost base, the complexity of the services and the lack of a national financial system. This forecast deficit excludes any overrun on the State Claims Agency. <\/p><p>  The HSE continues to work closely with my Department to mitigate the projected deficit to the greatest degree possible.<\/p><p>  The level of funding available for the health budget and the extent of the savings required in the health sector are being considered as part of the estimates and budgetary process for 2015 which is currently underway.

The acute hospital sector accounts for &euro;160m  or 57% of the overall deficit. Employment agency costs were &euro;194m, up &euro;63m on last year, a significant element of which was incurred in acute hospital services.

While the budgetary targets this year are particularly constrained, it is important to recognise that very demanding financial and resource constraints have applied in each of the last number of years as a direct consequence of the crisis in the public finances.  The cumulative impact of this unprecedented period of financial and resource restraint has resulted in reductions in the health service budget of the order of &euro;1.5 billion since 2008 with numbers employed reduced by over 14,000 over this period.<\/p><p>  These challenges come at a time when the demand for health services is increasing each year which, in turn, is driving costs upwards.

In addition, there is a commitment to the continued provision of medical services, including medical cards for the women.<br\/><br\/>This followed Government&rsquo;s examination of a report carried out by Professor Oonagh Walsh, on <i>Practice of Symphysiotomy in Ireland, between 1944 and 1984 <\/i>and<i><\/i>an <i>Independent Review of Issues relating to Symphysiotomy <\/i>by Judge Yvonne Murphy which advised Government, inter alia, on the relative liabilities of insurers, indemnifiers and\/or other parties in relation to symphysiotomy and on the merits and costs of proceeding with an ex gratia scheme relative to allowing the court process to proceed.<br\/><br\/>Judge Murphy outlined the case for a scheme in her report and her recommendations on levels of awards were accepted by Government.

Judge Murphy submitted her more detailed proposal to me on 11 September, setting out how the scheme should operate.  In this context I met the support groups representing women who have undergone symphysiotomy on 19 September.  I wanted to hear from the support groups how they hope the scheme will operate, and to confirm to them that the scheme will be established as quickly as possible.

Women may opt out at any stage in application and assessment process, up to the time of accepting their awards.  However, on accepting the offer of the award under the Scheme, women will have to agree to discontinue their legal proceedings against any party arising out of their symphysiotomy.<br\/><br\/>-  The details concerning the scheme and its commencement date will be advertised in national and other media, as decided by the Assessor.<br\/><br\/>I intend to finalise the details of the scheme shortly and will bring a Memorandum to Government requesting approval to appoint an Assessor for the scheme instead of it being administered by the State Claims Agency and to a small number of other amendments to the Government decision of last July.<br\/><br\/>While I am aware of the comments made by the UN Human Rights Committee, the Government believes that the establishment of this scheme is a fair and appropriate response. In agreeing to the ex-gratia scheme, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to trying to bring a resolution for the women concerned. The Government has acknowledged the pain and suffering which the procedure caused to many of the women and is aware also of  the uphill battle many of them will face in the courts with uncertainty about the outcome of that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000054#WRC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Provision","counter":138,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000054#WRC02600"},{"type":"question","counter":139,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[36535\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000054#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way he will improve the ambulance service, especially in rural Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":140,"content":"<p>The National Ambulance Service (NAS) is continuing to modernise and reconfigure its services to ensure emergency pre-hospital care is delivered in an appropriate and timely manner.

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines. In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website ().<br\/><br\/>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.

constituent part, constantly keeps its staffing levels under review to ensure that there are sufficient resources available to carry out the essential functions of the Office. As necessary, it seeks the sanction of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and undertakes recruitment competitions to maintain appropriate staffing levels. A competition took place this year and one candidate took up duty on 29 September. It is expected that all vacancies will be filled before the end of the year. It should be noted that the figure of 3 vacancies at the end of 2012 and 2013 and the figure of 4 vacancies earlier this month are not the same vacancies.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 73,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.  <br\/><br\/>Maximum rent limits are generally reviewed every 18 months. The most recent review was completed in June 2013 with revised rent limits introduced on 17 June 2013. Despite pressures on the social protection budget, the last review saw rent limits increase in line with market rents in some areas, including Dublin and Galway, with Dublin limits increasing by a weighted average of 9%. <br\/><br\/>A new rent limit review has commenced within the Department and involves a comprehensive analysis of information from a range of sources including rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), the Central Statistics Office rental indices, websites advertising rental properties, relevant Departments and Agencies and non-Government organisations. Submissions have also been received from the Residential Landlords Association of Ireland and the Irish Property Owners Association representing the views of landlords. Any changes to social welfare supports have to be considered as part of the forthcoming budgetary process.<br\/><br\/>The current difficulties in the rental market and the difficulties faced by prospective tenants, including those seeking access to rent supplement, is a shortage of supply of suitable properties in areas of high demand. I would be concerned that raising rent limits is not the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers and students. The Government has recently launched its Construction Strategy with the aim of increasing housing supply generally. <br\/><br\/>I can assure the Deputies that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met. Discretionary powers are available to staff to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant. A notice reminding staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated in July 2014. <br\/><br\/>In view of the current supply difficulties, the Department has agreed a protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf. Since the launch of this initiative in mid-June 2014, approximately 120 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department. <br\/><br\/>The tabular statement provides details of the number of rent supplement recipients in County Meath since 2011 onwards. Statistics in relation to the numbers of rent supplement claims withdrawn are not available.<br\/><br\/>Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has a minimum income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum weekly contribution of &euro;30 for a single person or &euro;40 for a couple.  Where a person has an additional income above the rate of SWA they are, in certain circumstances, required to top up their rent. It is very difficult for the Department to identify under the counter top ups when both the tenant and landlord are in collusion and if the top up payment is being made in cash. <br\/><br\/>In such cases the Department&rsquo;s representative will discuss the circumstances of the case with the tenant before making any decision in relation to ongoing entitlement. The primary concern in dealing with such cases is to protect the tenant. The Department has not sought any prosecutions in relation to false declarations of rent payable to the landlord and does not maintain statistics on the number of rent supplement payments terminated due to this reason.  <br\/><br\/>The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to transfer responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need to local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Officials are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in introducing HAP on a phased basis, initially in Cork County, Limerick City and County and Waterford City and County from 15th September 2014.<br\/><br\/><b>Tabular Statement<\/b><br\/><br\/><b>Rent Supplement Recipients in Meath 2011 to present<\/b><table><tr><th>Period<\/th><th>Recipients<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>December 2011<\/td><td>2,723<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>December 2012<\/td><td>2,143<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>December 2013<\/td><td>1,941<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>End September 2014<\/td><td>1,777<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000055#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":172,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000055#WRD00550"},{"type":"question","counter":173,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[36454\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000055#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when an application for carer's allowance appeal will be finalised in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1087","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":174,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 10 July 2014.

It provides for over 28,000 programme opportunities for unemployed young people in 2014, as set out in the table attached as an appendix to this statement.  This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.  These PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for the young, although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee.  <br\/><br\/>In relation to the 28,500 places for unemployed young people, approximately 9,115 of these have been taken up year-to-date. This is actually an extremely conservative estimate given that up-to-date figures are not currently available for a number of schemes (as outlined in the table provided).  Some programmes such as the student intake on programmes such as the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) and Vocational Training Opportunity Scheme (VTOS) are concentrated in September\/October in line with the academic calendar.  A new intake of young people to the second iteration of the Momentum programme for long-term unemployed jobseekers is also scheduled for later in the year.  The table supplied displays the total number of under 25s who have started across the various programmes outlined in the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan up to the first seven months of 2014. <br\/><br\/>In addition, it is important to note that some of the initiatives planned under the guarantee required primary legislation to allow positive discrimination on age grounds in the provision of employment services and supports.  This legislation was enacted as part of the Social Welfare Bill over the summer.  Two employment schemes in particular, the Youth Guarantee developmental internship programme and the JobsPlus variant for young people, were dependent on this legislation being passed.  These schemes will be in place no later than October.  The legislation also permits the introduction of earlier and more intensive engagement by INTREO with the young unemployed which should also translate increased placement on schemes covered by the Youth Guarantee.<table><tr><th>Programme<\/th><th>2014 YTD<\/th><th>Note<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Youthreach\/CTC<\/td><td>809<\/td><td>Only CTC starters (end July 2014)&ndash; Youthreach figures not available for 2014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>JobBridge (including planned reserve)<\/td><td>1848<\/td><td>End July 2014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s<\/td><td>1,223<\/td><td>Year to Date<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>JobsPlus<\/td><td>250<\/td><td>As of  31st July 2014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Momentum<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>As of  31st August 2014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)<\/td><td>Not available <\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BTWEA<\/td><td>139<\/td><td>Including 5 persons on STEA<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>VTOS<\/td><td>Not available <\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>FAS\/Solas<\/td><td>4341<\/td><td>Based on SST, Traineeship, Bridging &amp;amp; LTI starters YTD <br \/><br \/>(end July 2014)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CEB youth Entrepreneurship Training and Mentoring supports<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>Not yet commenced<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CEB\/MFI micro-loans for young people<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>Not yet commenced<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gateway<\/td><td>122 <\/td><td>26th September 2014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Community Employment<\/td><td>375<\/td><td>31st August 2014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>RSS<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>26th September 2014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total <\/td><td>9,115<\/td><td>Excluding where figures are not available<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000055#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":190,"content":"<p>Question No. 138 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000055#WRD01850"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[36598\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000055#WRD01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision on a carer's allowance appeal will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":193,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 14 July 2014.

The Department of Social Protection is now responsible for CE. <br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the position of this Department in rejecting that liability for these costs should be met from public funds, this matter has been the subject of discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the unions representing CE supervisors. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has stated to the unions that companies contracted by the State to provide a service, including in the community sector, will have to manage their expenditure pressures, including labour and pension costs, from within existing funding levels.<br\/><br\/>Given the level of funding that would be required from this Department, the implementation of the claim is not considered sustainable in light of the current and on-going fiscal environment and the requirement to contain public expenditure. The costs of the introduction of any scheme are likely to be of the order of &euro;3m per annum, with retrospective costs of the order of at least &euro;39m. In this context, it should be noted that the Supervisors and Sponsors have made <b>no<\/b>contribution towards the cost of the pension arrangements they are currently seeking from the Department.<br\/><br\/>It should also be noted that this Department is not the employer of CE supervisors and such employees are not public servants but are employees of the sponsoring organisations. The responsibilities of the sponsoring organisations and the individuals concerned must also be recognised when considering pension provision arrangements. <br\/><br\/>Employers (including CE Sponsoring Organisations) are legally obliged to offer access to at least one Standard Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) under the Pension (Amendment) Act 2002.  All CE sponsoring organisations were informed by the Department of their responsibilities under this Act at that time.<br\/><br\/>CE Supervisors may also qualify for the State Pension at 66 years of age. If they have accrued sufficient PRSI contributions (520 contributions @ full rate, equivalent to 10 years contributions) they will qualify for the State Pension (Contributory), which is not means-tested. In the event that there are insufficient contributions, the person will qualify for the State Pension (Non-Contributory), provided they satisfy the means test.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the retirement age, the Department does not provide funding for any participant or supervisor who has reached the State Pension age. This has been Government policy since CE commenced in April 1994 as a working-age specific, active labour market intervention. The CE Procedures Manual does <b>not<\/b>form part of the direct terms and conditions of employment for supervisors or participants, but they do outline the conditions under which the Department will fund the Sponsoring Organisation for the CE positions (under Article 1 of the CE Agreement Contract signed by the Sponsor and the Department). The Department reserves the right to amend the Procedures Manual as and when required, as per Article 1.<br\/><br\/>The details of the employment contract issued by the Sponsoring Organisation are a matter between the CE Sponsor as the employer and the Supervisor, as the employee. The Department advises the Sponsoring Organisation to include retirement arrangements in any contractual agreements with employees of the scheme, including CE Supervisor, so that all parties are aware of the conditions under which funding is provided.

These increases were necessary to protect the yield from CGT in the context of the rebalancing of\u00a0the public finances.  An increase in the taxation of capital is preferable from the point of view of its impact on the economy as compared to an increase in employment taxes such as income tax.  In these various\u00a0circumstances, any reliefs introduced over recent years have had to be targeted and time-bound.<\/p><p>  A CGT relief was introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2012 to incentivise the purchase of property between 7 December 2011 and the end of 2013 with the intention of stimulating activity in the property market.  The incentive was subsequently extended to property purchased to the end of 2014.  I stated recently that this relief will not be extended further as it has served its purpose.<\/p><p>  The incentive applies to industrial, farmland, commercial and residential (buy-to-let) property (land and buildings) purchased to the end of this year.  If the property is held for more than 7 years, the capital gains attributable to those 7 years will be exempt from CGT on a proportionate basis relative to the period of ownership. Property sold within the 7 year period subsequent to purchase will not qualify for relief.<\/p><p>  Relief for farm restructuring was introduced in Finance Act 2013 on disposals of farm land for the purpose of farm restructuring or consolidation.  The relief applies to a sale, purchase or exchange of agricultural land in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 where Teagasc has certified that a sale and purchase or an exchange of agricultural land was made for farm restructuring purposes.<\/p><p>  Section 45 of Finance (No 2) Act of 2013 provides for a CGT relief for entrepreneurs who reinvest the proceeds from the disposal of assets made on or after 1 January 2010 in certain chargeable business assets.  Commencement of the legislative provisions is subject to EU state-aid approval.  Discussions with the EU Commission about State Aid clearance are ongoing.  I hope that these will result in a positive outcome in the near future.  Notwithstanding that the legislative provisions have yet to be commenced, the CGT relief will only apply, among other conditions, where new chargeable business assets acquired after 1 January 2014 \u00a0and up to end- December 2018 are disposed of having been held for a minimum period of 3 years after acquisition in that period.<\/p><p>  I am not in a position to say what the level of investment generated or jobs created by these reliefs will be as, among other reasons, individuals or companies who avail of them are not required to provide that information to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners.  As regards the numbers who will benefit and the cost, the reliefs will be claimed through the tax system under self-assessment.  The various reliefs which I have outlined are not long introduced.  Moreover, in the case of the property incentive relief, individuals must hold on to any property acquired for a minimum of 7 years in order to claim the relief while the CGT entrepreneur relief has yet to be commenced and qualifying assets under that relief must be held for a minimum of 3 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000058#WRG02700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2015","counter":297,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000059#WRH00150"},{"type":"question","counter":298,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[36445\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000059#WRH00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"with regard to the forthcoming budget and the outcome of the agri-taxation review that consideration will be given to the introduction of a tax deposit scheme to manage income volatility; if further consideration will be given to the retention of the pay and file deadline of 31 October for self-assessed income tax returns and the simplification of income tax returns for farmers with a low turnover.","asker":"996","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":299,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that it is not the practice of the Minister for Finance to comment in advance on matters related to the Budget. However I can advise him that the review to which he refers will be\u00a0published around\u00a0Budget Day.<br\/><br\/>The annual filing date for self-assessed income taxpayers is currently the 31 October. Taxpayers who file their returns and also make their appropriate payments via the Revenue On-Line Service, ROS, receive an extension each year. This year the ROS extended filing date is up to midnight on 13 November 2014.<br\/><br\/>As regards proposed changes, the Deputy may recall that, following a consultation process,\u00a0I decided not to introduce any changes to that regime for 2014. The option of bringing the annual Pay &amp;amp; File dates forward remains, in order to provide increased certainty around the annual tax take and forecasting process following the move to an earlier Budget Day. However, given the success of the forecasting process in relation to Budget 2014 and given the concerns expressed by many stakeholders at the potential disruption that could be caused by such a change, I am considering whether it may be feasible to leave the dates unchanged for 2015 also.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the simplification of income tax returns for farmers with a low income, as I previously informed the House in my reply to Question 35936\/14, the simplification agenda for all taxpayers is an issue that the Revenue Commissioners are very strongly committed to. Their strategies involve designing out complexity, providing quality services and minimising compliance costs for all taxpayers.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>In relation to tax returns, there is a suite of simplified paper income tax returns which were introduced by the Commissioners in 2011 specifically as part of a customer service initiative aimed at reducing the administrative burden on any taxpayer whose tax affairs are not overly complex.

Personal consumption was up by 1.9 per cent in the second quarter of this year (year-on-year) and healthy retail sales so far this year, along with improving consumer sentiment, bode well for the second half of this year. There has also been a return to growth in 'core' (excluding aeroplanes) investment, with both construction and machinery and equipment growing in recent quarters.<br\/><br\/>Perhaps the most significant development is that employment has now increased in each of the last seven quarters, with employment up 1.7 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter. \u00a0Employment has now increased by over 70,000 since the low-point in mid-2012.

The programme is supported by a combination of student fees, State funding and other income.\u00a0\u00a0<br\/><br\/>While in this case the fees could be considered high, in the majority of cases where third level tuition fees are payable they are at much lower levels.\u00a0 In addition, those participating in the programme must already have acquired an undergraduate degree, the fees for which would have been covered by the State in the vast majority of cases. <br\/><br\/>I\u00a0would point out that tax relief at the standard rate of 20% is available in respect of qualifying fees paid by an individual for a third level education course, including a postgraduate course.<br\/><br\/>Qualifying fees mean tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college and includes what is referred to as the &quot;student contribution&quot;. \u00a0No other fees e.g. administration fees, examination fees, capitation fees, qualify for tax relief. \u00a0Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grant, scholarship, employer contribution or other means are deducted in arriving at the net qualifying fees. A claim for relief may be made in respect of a number of students.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>In making a claim for relief for the tax year 2014, the maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per student, but an amount set out in the legislation must be disregarded from each claim (whether in respect of one or more students).\u00a0 Where a claim for relief includes fees paid on behalf of at least one full-time student, the disregard is &euro;2,750. \u00a0Where a claim for relief includes fees solely paid on behalf of a part-time student or part-time students, the amount disregarded is &euro;1,375. \u00a0Thus, for example, an individual undertaking a graduate entry medical course\u00a0on a full-time basis, where tuition fees of &euro;15,000 per student apply, would attract relief of &euro;850 made up as follows:<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>&euro;<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Tuition fees\u00a0<\/td><td>&euro;15,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Capped at \u00a0<\/td><td>&euro;7,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Less\u00a0<\/td><td>&euro;2,750<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>&euro;4,250 @ 20% = &euro;850<\/td><\/tr><\/table>It is a long-standing practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.

Paragraph (c) of subsection (2), which refers to services rendered, reads as follows:<\/p><p>&quot;(c) the cost to the person chargeable of any services rendered or goods provided by such person, otherwise than as maintenance or repairs, being services or goods which-<\/p><p>(i) in the case of a rent under a lease, such person is legally bound under the lease to render or provide but in respect of which such person receives no separate consideration, and<\/p><p>(ii) in any other case, relate to and constitute an expense of the transaction or transactions under which the rents or receipts were received, not being an expense of a capital nature;&quot;.<\/p><p>   As the payment of Local Property Tax (LPT) under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) by the &quot;person chargeable&quot;, i.e. the landlord, is not a service rendered by that person, a deduction for LPT is not allowable under section 97(2)(c). In the context of property rental, examples of such services would include garden maintenance, laundry or house cleaning. While it is not possible to be definitive as regards local charges which might apply in the future, it is difficult to envisage that their treatment under section 97(2)(c) would be any different to the treatment which applies to LPT under that provision.<\/p><p>  I am also advised that LPT is an annual self-assessed tax on residential properties in the State and is administered by the Revenue Commissioners in accordance with the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) and that the reference to local authority rates in section 97(2) is, following the removal of rates on domestic property in the late 1970's, a reference only to rates on commercial property payable to local authorities in accordance with the relevant local government legislation. Notwithstanding that local authorities can, with effect from 2015, vary the rate of LPT in accordance with section 20 of the LPT legislation, LPT is not a rate levied by a local authority and is, therefore, not deductible from gross rents under section 97(2). <\/p><p>  As regards the recommendation of the Thornhill Report that the local property tax should be a deductible expense in calculating a landlord's taxable rental income, the Government has agreed in principle to accept\u00a0this recommendation. The Thornhill group recognised the considerable pressures on the public finances and the need to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue, and, for this reason, suggested that consideration be given to phasing in deductibility over a period of years. The Thornhill group also considered that it was for Government, having regard to the prevailing budgetary situation, to decide on the time span for phasing-in deductibility and on what percentage of LPT to allow as a deduction from gross rents for tax purposes. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, it\u00a0would not be appropriate for me to comment on matters that may or may not feature in the Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000059#WRH03100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":340,"content":"<p>Question No. 199 answered with Question No. 193.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Increases","counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000059#WRH03250"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[36946\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000059#WRH03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the partial and full-year cost to the Exchequer of raising the VAT registration threshold for small and medium enterprises with low turnover from &euro;70,000 to &euro;100,000, &euro;150,000, &euro;200,000 and &euro;250,000, respectively; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the VAT registration threshold for goods, which is currently &euro;75,000.

The programme is supported by a combination of student fees, State funding and other income.<br\/><br\/>While in this case the fees could be considered high, in the majority of cases where third level tuition fees are payable they are at much lower levels.  In addition, those participating in the programme must already have acquired an undergraduate degree, the fees for which would have been covered by the State in the vast majority of cases. <br\/><br\/>I\u00a0would point out that tax relief at the standard rate of 20% is available in respect of qualifying fees paid by an individual for a third level education course, including a postgraduate course.<br\/><br\/>Qualifying fees mean tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college and includes what is referred to as the &quot;student contribution&quot;.  No other fees e.g. administration fees, examination fees, capitation fees, qualify for tax relief.  Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grant, scholarship, employer contribution or other means are deducted in arriving at the net qualifying fees.  A claim for relief may be made in respect of a number of students.<br\/><br\/>In making a claim for relief for the tax year 2014, the maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per student, but an amount set out in the legislation must be disregarded from each claim (whether in respect of one or more students).  Where a claim for relief includes fees paid on behalf of at least one full-time student, the disregard is &euro;2,750.Where a claim for relief includes fees solely paid on behalf of a part-time student or part-time students, the amount disregarded is &euro;1,375.  Thus, for example, an individual undertaking a graduate entry medical course\u00a0on a full-time basis, where tuition fees of &euro;15,000 per student apply, would attract relief of &euro;850 made up as follows:<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>&euro;<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Tuition fees\u00a0<\/td><td>&euro;15,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Capped at \u00a0<\/td><td>&euro;7,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Less\u00a0<\/td><td>&euro;2,750<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>&euro;4,250 @ 20% = &euro;850<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>It is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.

The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;414,000.  For contracts below these thresholds, the general requirement is that they be advertised on the national public procurement website or, depending on value, awarded on the basis of a competitive process of direct invitation to an adequate number of suppliers.<br\/><br\/>The aim of these European rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.

The schemes concerned are:<br\/><br\/>Clonmel (River Suir)<br\/><br\/>Dublin (River Dodder Tidal)<br\/><br\/>Dublin (River Tolka)<br\/><br\/>Dublin Fingal (River Tolka)<br\/><br\/>Duleek (River Nanny)<br\/><br\/>Dunmanway ( River Bandon)<br\/><br\/>Ennis (River Fergus Upper)<br\/><br\/>Fermoy (River Blackwater)<br\/><br\/>Kilkenny City (River Nore)<br\/><br\/>Meath (River Tolka)<br\/><br\/>Mornington (River Mornington)<br\/><br\/>Tullamore (River Tullamore)<br\/><br\/>The information provided to Insurance Ireland has also been published on the OPW website .  Information on further completed schemes will be made available to Insurance Ireland by the OPW before the end of the year, as work on compiling the data in the agreed format is finalised.<br\/><br\/>Officials from the Department of Finance meet, on a regular basis, with Insurance Ireland.  The Department has recently requested Insurance Ireland to provide information on the specific actions taken by the industry to meet its obligations under the MoU, the extent to which insurance companies are actually using the details provided by OPW on completed schemes to re-assess flood risk in the benefiting areas and what impact this is actually having on the availability of flood cover where not previously available and\/or on the cost of that cover to households or small business.  I will be meeting with Insurance Ireland shortly, and I will be pressing for this information to be provided.<br\/><br\/>Decisions on the provision of flood insurance cover and on the premiums to be charged will remain a commercial matter for individual insurance companies but I expect that the operation of the MoU and the continuing investment by the State in major flood defence works will lead to the greater availability of flood insurance in areas benefiting from those works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000060#WRJ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1106"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000060#WRJ02650"},{"type":"question","counter":387,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[36627\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000060#WRJ02700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plan to eliminate flooding in Kilbannivane graveyard, Castleisland, County Kerry; when this work will proceed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":388,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works has recently approved funding of &euro;144,000 to Kerry County Council under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme for flood mitigation works at this location, which will also provide protection to a number of homes and a commercial property. <br\/><br\/>The progression of these works is a matter for the Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000060#WRJ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1106"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Civil Service Accountability","counter":389,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000060#WRJ02850"},{"type":"question","counter":390,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[36643\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000060#WRJ02900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"as part of his project of reform, if he has considered restructuring and amalgamating any grades within the civil service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1190","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":397,"content":"<p>The work of the Statute Law Revision Programme to date in removing obsolete legislation from the statute book has been strongly supported by outside observers such as the OECD, and is a key part of the Programme for Government 2011-2016 and the Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016.  The forthcoming pre-1820 Bill will be the single largest repealing measure in the history of either this or any other State and will be an important building block towards an eventually fully-revised Statute Book.<\/p><p>  Prior to 2012 the Statute Law Revision Programme was located in the Office of the Attorney General.  For this reason my Department had no 2011 or 2012 budget allocation for the programme.  The outturn for 2012 was &euro;91,821 which reflected a number of work streams during that year including the enactment of the Statute Law Revision Act 2012 which completed the review of all pre-independence primary legislation. <\/p><p>  In 2013 a budget allocation of\u00a0&euro;138,000 was provided for, with an outturn of\u00a0 &euro;125,970.75.  In July 2013 the Government agreed to pursue several work streams of statute law revision across the Statute Book including in relation to post-1922 Acts, secondary legislation both pre- and post-1922, and charters. <\/p><p>  In 2014 a budget allocation of\u00a0&euro;159,000 was provided for, with an outturn of\u00a0 &euro;79,784.19 in the year to date.  The budget allocation for 2015 and 2016 has not yet been determined and will be dealt with in due course as part of the Estimates process.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that as regards these budget allocations, the Estimates heading for Statute Law Revision Programme includes payment for the\u00a0Legal Adviser to the Government Reform Unit who carries out advisory functions in relation to other legislative priorities in the Programme for Government\u00a0 such as the Freedom of Information Bill, the Public Service Standards Bill, the Protected Disclosure Act and a number of other measures.  The budget allocation set out in the following figures therefore does not exclusively relate to statute law revision as such and includes the full range of services of the Legal Adviser.<\/p><p>  In relation to the expenditure on the specific tasks associated with the current Bill it should be noted that the pre-1820 Bill is the first in a series dealing with secondary legislation.  It is intended that, subject to the passing of this measure, later Bills will deal with later periods of secondary legislation.  For this reason, in tandem with the preparation of this Bill, work has continued on a number of other areas.  These include the analysis of later secondary instruments, a scoping exercise in relation to a Bill to repeal spent and obsolete primary legislation enacted by the Oireachtas post-1922, and recording charters and letters patent.  Because the activity of the Programme has been carried out in a number of parallel work streams a breakdown of the specific cost attributable to the pre-1820 Bill is not available. <\/p><p>  Finally, in addition to the figures set out about, some permanent staff of the Department have at various times also been engaged in the programme on a part-time basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000060#WRJ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates Valuation Process","counter":398,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000060#WRJ03450"},{"type":"question","counter":399,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[36834\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000060#WRJ03500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his views on reclassifying pre school facilities as educational so that they can have similar status for commercial rates as the education sector.

Under the CEB Dissolution Act 2014, I retain responsibility for policy determination and budgets, which is managed by way of a Service Level Agreement between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities.\r\n\r\nWith effect from 1 August 2014, Forf&aacute;s was integrated into my Department and the Irish National Accreditation Board was transferred from Forf&aacute;s to the Health and Safety Authority, pursuant to the Industrial Development (Forf&aacute;s Dissolution) Act, 2014.\r\n\r\nA Reform Programme also underway will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission.

While respecting the confidentiality clause, I want to stress that it did not provide for any compensation whatsoever to be paid to Mr Fleury. Furthermore, I can confirm that the Department&rsquo;s costs in the Fleury case will be a small fraction of the exaggerated figure mentioned in the press coverage.  I want to emphasise also that the investigation into the Fleury case by the Department had no bearing on the actual settlement of the case. The settlement was agreed only following an approach by Mr Fleury&rsquo;s legal team seeking a comprehensive settlement to the outstanding legal issues between him and the Department. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>It is also relevant to note that the Department secured a conviction in 2001 against GVM Exports Ltd, in which Mr Fleury held 50% ownership and was a Director, in respect of offences detected in the course of this investigation. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The substance of the Fleury case relates to events in 1999 <font color=\"#222222\">at a time when Bovine Brucellosis was causing great hardship to the farming community and\u00a0imposing significant costs<\/font><font color=\"#222222\">on the Exchequer.  It<\/font>resulted from an investigation by the Department into the illegal movement of cattle in breach of the TB and Brucellosis eradication schemes.  Following the investigation, normal legal procedures were followed involving the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Courts Service and resulted in Mr Fleury and GVM Exports Ltd being charged with offences relating to the illegal movement of cattle (i.e. without a pre-movement Brucellosis test) and other offences relating to animal identification. <br\/><br\/>The prosecution of the case was delayed for a considerable period of time over the years, largely due to challenges to the prosecutions initiated by Mr Fleury, some of which were the subject of Supreme Court rulings, the most recent in December 2013.  While the Court ruled in substance against all of his challenges, Mr Fleury had recently mounted further legal challenges to the re-activation of the prosecution and it was in this context that Mr Fleury&rsquo;s legal team sought a settlement. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b><font color=\"#222222\">With regard to the other case referred to by the Deputy, the Fannin case arose from an investigation that took place in 2009 and came before the Courts in 2013. The charges related to the alleged interference with the TB test. The investigation in this case was a joint investigation between my Department and the Gardai. Following the investigation, a file was submitted to the DPP who directed that certain charges be pursued. This case was heard before the Circuit Court.  On the eighth<\/font><font color=\"#222222\">day of the trial, the presiding Judge terminated the trial, and directed that Mr Fannin be acquitted, criticising the prosecution and the Department in particular.  The key factor in concluding the trial appears to relate to confusion concerning the presentation of certain evidence,<\/font><font color=\"#222222\">whether or not a brucellosis test had been carried out at the time of the TB test in March 2009<\/font><font color=\"#222222\">,<\/font><font color=\"#222222\">and the significance of this.  However, this matter was not part of the Book of Evidence or the submitted prosecution case.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#222222\">  I initiated an internal review into how this particular case was handled within my Department.  The position is that the report finds no evidence that Department staff sought in any way to mislead the court - a most serious inference carried in some commentary on the subject. A number of recommendations were made with regard to staff training, file preparation and to review current procedures of making available biological sample evidence to the defence. These recommendations are being examined currently.<\/font><br\/><br\/>With regard to inspections by officials of the Department, it should be noted that the Department deploys its general\u00a0control and inspectorate staff to ensure food safety, animal health and welfare and to safeguard expenditure of public funds. These controls underpin and safeguard public confidence in Agri-food production and processing in Ireland and contribute to a very significant export market. <br\/><br\/>In some cases, the outcome of inspections leads to further investigation which may then cause charges to be brought before the Courts. The procedures adopted by the Department staff in the context of investigations which lead to charges comply with the standard requirements in regard to the taking and presentation of evidence and the rights of the person or persons being investigated.\u00a0 They follow the same protocols as are used for criminal investigations carried out by the Gardai. <br\/><br\/>Separate and distinct from these cases, I recently reviewed the structure and governance around the conduct of all investigations by my Department, both internal and external. As a result of this review, I decided on the establishment of a new Investigations Division on 8th July 2014. This decision recognises the need for the Department to have in place a strong, cohesive, consolidated and effective investigation capability to ensure and protect the reputation of the expanding Agri-food industry and indeed public funds. It brings all investigation capability into one Division. The Division is headed by a Senior Superintending Veterinary Officer, supported by a team of investigators, some of whom are core members of the team and others to be drawn from areas where their expertise will be beneficial to the conduct of particular types of investigations. Such investigations will be conducted where, for example, there is evidence of suspected fraud, whether internal or external, or serious breaches of food safety or animal health and welfare laws and which are of such scale or complexity that requires the type of investigative capacity that would not be available in the course of normal inspection work. <br\/><br\/>The new Investigations Division reports to an Investigations Steering Group chaired by the Assistant Secretary General responsible for Corporate Affairs and will comprise the Chief Veterinary Officer, the Assistant Secretary General with responsibility for direct payments, and the Heads of Legal Services, Internal Audit and HR. This group will, in all new cases, determine whether matters should be referred back to line Divisions for follow through, whether an investigation is warranted and if so, whether this should be conducted by the Investigations Division or referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Where investigations are being conducted internally, the Steering Group will oversee the conduct of investigations and, in conjunction with the Head of the Division, determine whether submission of cases for prosecution is warranted. This new Investigations Division includes the functions previously undertaken by the Special Investigations Unit.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, m<font color=\"#222222\">y Department seeks<\/font><font color=\"#222222\">to promote the highest levels of legal compliance to protect the health of consumers and to promote and sustain a vibrant Agri-food industry in Ireland. This is vital to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation internationally as a producer of world class products. It is also vital to support and protect an industry that employs over 170,000 people and<\/font><font color=\"#222222\">which exported &euro;10 billion worth of food and drinks products last year. <\/font>In this regard, I acknowledge the dedication and commitment of the staff of my Department who carry out investigations in sometimes very challenging circumstances. These new arrangements provide for expanded and coordinated investigative capability for the Department whilst also providing for enhanced governance arrangements in respect of investigations carried out. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000063#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agrifood Sector","counter":493,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000063#WRM02300"},{"type":"question","counter":494,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[36882\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000063#WRM02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the total value of Ireland's agricultural imports and exports with Canada in the years 2011, 2012 and 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":495,"content":"<p>The table below shows the value of Ireland&rsquo;s Agri-Food trade with Canada for the three years in question.<table><tr><th>Irish Agri-Food Trade with Canada <\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Exports to Canada <\/td><td><div>2011 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2012 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2013 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro; Millions <\/td><td><div>84 <\/div><\/td><td><div>92 <\/div><\/td><td><div>79 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Imports from Canada <\/td><td><div>2011 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2012 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2013 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro; Millions <\/td><td><div>57 <\/div><\/td><td><div>43 <\/div><\/td><td><div>61 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000063#WRM02500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":497,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[36883\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000063#WRM02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the total value of Ireland's agricultural imports and exports with South Africa in the years 2011, 2012 and 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":498,"content":"<p>The table below shows the value of Ireland&rsquo;s Agri-Food trade with South Africa for the three years in question. <table><tr><th>Irish Agri-Food Trade with South Africa <\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Exports to South Africa <\/td><td><div>2011 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2012 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2013 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro; Millions <\/td><td><div>57 <\/div><\/td><td><div>62 <\/div><\/td><td><div>50 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Imports from South Africa <\/td><td><div>2011 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2012 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2013 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro; Millions <\/td><td><div>38 <\/div><\/td><td><div>39 <\/div><\/td><td><div>40 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000063#WRM02800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Appeals","counter":499,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000063#WRM02900"},{"type":"question","counter":500,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[36906\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000063#WRM03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when an agricultural appeal in relation to a person (details supplied) in County Galway will be finalised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":501,"content":"<p>A review of the land parcels declared by the person named under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme revealed that several of the land parcels declared by the person named contained ineligible features.

The report found that there have been significant improvements in the service response to homelessness of children and this has contributed to a decrease in the number of children presenting to services as being homeless.<\/p><p>  It should of course be noted that policy responsibility for homeless young people, insofar as it extends to my Department, relates to children under 18 and any child welfare and protection concerns that may arise in the context of the Child Care Act 1991.  Young people who are homeless, either singly or as part of a family unit and not falling within this category are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.  Young people who were formerly in the care of the State and presently in receipt of aftercare services will, as part of this support, have their accommodation needs identified.<\/p><p>  Children under 16 who present as being homeless to emergency services are taken into care. Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care, or provided a service under Section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991.  Such children are typically more challenging to care for as they may be out of school; have experienced neglect and serious family discord; problematic drug use; have mental health or learning difficulties.  These children often wish to be only involved with peers and they may be less inclined to engage with social work services.  Services need to provide early and flexible options to engage with these children and to support them beyond their 18th birthday.<\/p><p>  Aftercare is the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him\/her in making the transition to independent living.  The children most vulnerable to homelessness as care leavers are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements.  Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that helps them achieve positive outcomes.  It is essential that these young people have an opportunity to develop a relationship with a dedicated aftercare worker who will work with them to identify their needs and ensure that services are in place to help provide them with the stability and support they need.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.  This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.<\/p><p>  The prioritisation of services for young people receiving aftercare is considered in the context of the statutory and administrative criteria and rules relating to State provision of services and the requirement of all State bodies to provide services in accordance with resources available to them.  The Agency and officials of the DCYA have been and continue to explore these matters further with the relevant Departments and agencies, on a bi-lateral basis, to continue to support the improvement of aftercare for this vulnerable cohort.<\/p><p>  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, at its sitting on 1 April, considered the draft aftercare provisions.  The Committee&rsquo;s report on the Bill was made available to the Department in mid-July and is currently under consideration, prior to refining the text of the provisions in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000066#WRP05500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Staff","counter":691,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000067#WRQ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":692,"qnumday":316,"qnumall":"[36470\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000067#WRQ00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 751 of 17 September 2014, if he will provide a breakdown on a regional basis of the number of social worker vacancies in each region; the number of the 100 current vacancies which are vacant due to maternity leave.","asker":"1190","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":693,"content":"<p>The following table presents details on the number of social work posts at various stages of recruitment and of maternity leave by region across the Child and Family Agency.

I lead a small Department and part of my role is to bring together the effort across all aspects of Government in achieving better outcomes for children. This vision is articulated in <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures,<\/i>the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, published earlier this year. This whole of government policy framework  establishes a shared set of National Outcomes and requires Government Departments and State agencies to work together in an integrated way along with non-government organisations to achieve better outcomes for children and young people.<br\/><br\/>My Department is taking a lead role in the cross-sectoral implementation of the <i>Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children<\/i>. A Children First Implementation Inter-Departmental Group, which involves all of the key Government Departments together with the Child and Family Agency and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is chaired by officials from my Department. The purpose of the Group is to promote the importance of Children First compliance across Government and to ensure a consistent approach is adopted. It should be noted that the Children First Bill, 2014, which is currently progressing through the Oireachtas, includes a provision to place this Group on a statutory basis. <br\/><br\/>The establishment of and responsibility for the Child and Family Agency is central to my Department's responsibilities. The Child and Family Agency Act 2013 sets out the Agency's functions as supporting the development, welfare and protection of children and the effective functioning of families.  I also have a range of responsibilities concerning the welfare of children arising from various functions transferred to it on and since the establishment of the Department under transfer of functions orders. These include my responsibility through the Children Act 2001 for the welfare of children who are detained by order of the Courts in the Children Detention Schools at Oberstown. <br\/><br\/>My decision to transfer two questions that were submitted by the Deputy last week to the Department of Health was simply a factual matter of legal responsibility. The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and policy responsibility in respect of CAMHS rests with the Minister for Health. CAMHS did not transfer to the newly established Child and Family Agency, Tusla, which was established on 1st January 2014.

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines. In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website (). <br\/><br\/>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. Due to the very difficult and challenging economic environment in which the Government targeted additional savings in health expenditure of &euro;619 million in 2014, which must be achieved while protecting front line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible, the HSE decided it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. <br\/><br\/>It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost effectiveness of Fampridine. Biogen Idec's Irish management indicated to the HSE in November 2013 that it intended to re-submit an application in April 2014. The HSE has advised it received a revised application from Biogen Idec on Friday 25th July. This application is currently being assessed in line with the agreed procedures and timescales.

It is estimated that up to 95% of people's health and social service needs can be met within a primary care setting.The Government is committed to the development of both Primary Care and Disability Services and to improve access to therapy services.<br\/><br\/>In that context, an additional &euro;20m in funding was allocated in 2013 to strengthen primary care services and to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line posts and enhance the capacity of the Primary Care services.  This will help to significantly address waiting times for services.  As part of this initiative, the HSE commenced recruitment last year of over 260 additional posts for Primary Care Teams including 52 Speech &amp;amp; Language Therapy posts. <b><\/b>The HSE has confirmed that all but one of these speech and language posts has been filled to date.<br\/><br\/>In addition, the HSE has introduced a number of initiatives specifically in relation to speech and language therapy such as therapists increasing clinic based work instead of domiciliary work and providing family centred interventions in a group as opposed to a one-to-one setting, whenever possible.  This will also help to address the issue of waiting lists and ensure that services are delivered in as equitable a manner as possible, within available resources.<br\/><br\/>The HSE has recognised that there is a need to standardise early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities.  A major reconfiguration of therapy resources for children with disabilities aged up to 18 years is currently underway under the <i>HSE&rsquo;s National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18years).  <\/i>This Programme aims to achieve a national unified approach to delivering disability health services, so that there is greater equity of access to services, based on need, and clearer referral pathways to these services and improved collaboration between sectors.An additional &euro;4million euro has been specifically allocated in 2014 to drive implementation of the Programme.  This equates to approximately 80 therapy posts, which have now been allocated across the HSE.

NHS funding can cover the costs of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection. The number of cycles available varies from region to region across the UK. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published a guideline on fertility treatment in 2004, which was updated in February 2013. The guideline covers what levels of funding should be available throughout England and Wales. Decision making on the amount of funding is made at a local level by Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). Some CCGs in England fund one cycle, some two, and others three cycles. There are a few CCGs who do not fund IVF or ICSI at all. The Expert Advisory Group on Infertility in Scotland (EAGISS) published a guideline on the care of infertile couples in February 2000.

The key response is the establishment of an ex gratia payment scheme, which will cost around &euro;34 million.  In addition, there is a commitment to the continued provision of medical services, including medical cards for the women.  This followed Government&rsquo;s examination of a report carried out by Professor Oonagh Walsh, on <i>Practice of Symphysiotomy in Ireland, between 1944 and <\/i>1984 and an <i>Independent Review of Issues relating to Symphysiotomy <\/i>by Judge Yvonne Murphy which advised Government, inter alia, on the relative liabilities of insurers, indemnifiers and\/or other parties in relation to symphysiotomy and on the merits and costs of proceeding with an ex gratia scheme relative to allowing the court process to proceed.<br\/><br\/>Judge Murphy outlined the case for a scheme in her report and her recommendations on levels of awards were accepted by Government.  Subsequently, I asked Judge Murphy to draw up a detailed draft scheme. I have consulted through the summer with the Judge and have also been speaking to relevant parties about the proposed scheme.  Judge Murphy submitted her more detailed proposal to me on 11 September, setting out how the scheme should operate.  In this context I met the support groups representing women who have undergone symphysiotomy on 19 September. I wanted to hear from the support groups how they hope the scheme will operate, and to confirm to them that the scheme will be established as quickly as possible.<br\/><br\/>Key aspects of the proposed scheme include: <br\/><br\/>- Women who had a surgical symphysiotomy in the State between the years 1940 and 1990 may apply in accordance with, and subject to the terms of the scheme. <br\/><br\/>- The scheme will be run by an independent Assessor.If women have questions on any aspect of the scheme, the Assessor or secretariat, will be available to assist. <br\/><br\/>- The scheme will be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial. It will allow women to have legal and other advice available to them in preparing to submit an application.  It will result in awards of between &euro;50,000 and &euro;150,000 for the women.<br\/><br\/>- Women who have had a surgical symphysiotomy and have medical evidence to prove it may accept an award of &euro;50,000 without further assessment. If no medical records are available a medical assessment will be carried out.<br\/><br\/>- For those who wish to apply for higher awards (&euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000) a medical assessment may be necessary if up to date medical records are not available, or if the Assessor decides this is needed for final determination of the award.<br\/><br\/>- Women will not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a pre-condition to participating in the scheme.  Women may opt out at any stage in application and assessment process, up to the time of accepting their awards.  However, on accepting the offer of the award under the Scheme, women will have to agree to discontinue their legal proceedings against any party arising out of their symphysiotomy.<br\/><br\/>I intend to finalise the details of the scheme shortly and will bring a Memorandum to Government requesting approval to appoint an Assessor for the scheme instead of it being administered by the State Claims Agency and to a small number of other amendments to the Government decision of last July.  The details concerning the scheme and its commencement date will be advertised in national and other media, as decided by the Assessor.  I hope that when the women see the details of the scheme and the efforts made to ensure it is person-centred, simple and non-adversarial many of them will opt to join the scheme.  In agreeing to the ex gratia scheme, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to trying to bring a resolution for the women concerned. The Government has acknowledged the pain and suffering which the procedure caused to many of the women and is aware also of  the uphill battle many of them will face in the courts with uncertainty about the outcome of that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000071#WRU01800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Status","counter":927,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000071#WRU01850"},{"type":"question","counter":928,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[36847\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000071#WRU01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite a hospital appointment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Longford.","asker":"1065","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":929,"content":"<p>The National Waiting List Management Policy, <i>A standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, January 2014,<\/i>has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.

As part of the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance, Mr. Pat McLoughlin was appointed as Independent Chair to work with insurance companies, my Department and the HIA to identify effective cost management strategies for the industry. Mr. McLoughlin's final report is expected shortly and I will consider how the recommendations can best be implemented.  <\/p><p>  I am also keen to create the best possible environment within which more people, particularly young people, will want to obtain and retain private health insurance. Under Lifetime Community Rating, from 1 May 2015 loadings will be incurred by anyone aged 35 or over taking out private health insurance for the first time. Loadings can be avoided by taking out health insurance before this date. I am also going to address the sharp price increase that younger people currently experience when they can no longer avail of student discounts.

Implementation of MFTP commenced in January and the new model is being rolled-out in phases over the coming years.<\/p><p>  A new Patient Level Costing (PLC) system is being implemented in public hospitals to help them to analyse and interpret their operating costs.  Although a pilot PLC project has been underway since 2010, the PLC function must now be embedded across all hospitals. This will require investment in skills and also in PLC IT systems and feeder IT systems to improve the collection and analysis of cost data.

The Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance was established in Ireland in January 2007 and published its report in August 2008.  The Commission's report provides the roadmap to developing a national culture of patient safety and recommends increased leadership and accountability throughout the service through new governance, management and reporting structures.  The Commission made a wide range of detailed recommendations in the following areas:<br\/><br\/>- Involvement of Patients, Carers and Service-Users in the system which covers communications, open disclosure etc.<br\/><br\/>- Leadership and Accountability in the system which includes governance, management and reporting structures, education, training, research etc.<br\/><br\/>- Organisational and Professional Regulatory Framework which includes licensing of healthcare facilities, regulation of healthcare professionals and credentialing;<br\/><br\/>- Quality Improvement and Learning Systems which includes evidence-based practice, clinical audit, adverse event reporting, medication safety, health information and technology. <br\/><br\/>Since the publication of the Commission's Report the Department and its Agencies have continued to work towards improving patient safety. <br\/><br\/>In addition, a number of HIQA Reports and investigations including the HIQA Investigation into UHG  (2013) and the CMO's Report on Perinatal Deaths (2006-to date) in Portlaoise Regional Hospital earlier this year have informed policy on patient safety and demonstrate that we still face many challenges to ensure that our  health and social care services are truly safe and of the highest quality.<br\/><br\/>The HSE, in its National Service Plan 2014 has threaded through the Plan a requirement that at a time of further financial contraction, it is especially important to ensure that providing the best level of care for patients and service users, must be at the forefront of planning for and management of services. This commitment is also a central theme of <b><i>Future Health - A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015<\/i><\/b><i>. <\/i>To this end, the HSE has emphasised specific measures focused on quality and patient safety in the Service Plan including HCAIs, Medication Safety and implementation of Early Warning Score Systems.  My officials meet with the HSE each month on the Service Plan and patient safety is a standing item on that agenda. <br\/><br\/>There are many facets to the patient safety agenda and several initiatives underway have the potential to drive significant change throughout  health service provision over the coming years.  The leadership of this change from a governance and management perspective will be a key dimension of progressing towards this goal. <br\/><br\/>I will just detail briefly below some of the key initiatives introduced to progress patient safety: <br\/><br\/>- The establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) which is the independent authority responsible for driving quality, safety and accountability in residential services for children, older people and people with disabilities in Ireland.  HIQA also sets, monitors and inspects against healthcare standards. <br\/><br\/>- Approval and publication of HIQA's <b>National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare<\/b>in June 2012.  <br\/><br\/>- Clinical effectiveness is a key component of safe, quality care.  To this end the Minister for Health established the <b>National  Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) <\/b>in 2010 to provide a framework for national endorsement of clinical guidelines and audit to optimise patient care.<b><\/b>To date, three National Clinical Guidelines have been  launched: the National<b>E<\/b>arly Warning Score for Ireland (NEWS), the Prevention and Control Methicillin-Resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus <\/i>(MRSA) and Surveillance, Diagnosis and Management of Clostridium difficile Infection in Ireland.<b><\/b>Each guideline has been subject to an economic evaluation and implementation will be monitored through the HSE's monthly Performance Assurance Reports, compliance with HIQA's National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare and increased alignment with the clinical indemnity scheme. <br\/><br\/>- An additional four guidelines were commissioned by my predecessor, arising out of the HIQA report into the Halappanavar case: Sepsis, Paediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS), Maternal Early Warning Score (MEWS) and Clinical Handover.It is planned to launch the Sepsis and MEWS Guidelines in November. <br\/><br\/>- A <b>National Patient Safety Advisory Group <\/b>has been established to support my Department in providing national leadership on patient safety and quality and to advise on the development of policy in the area of patient safety and quality.<br\/><br\/>- Legislative proposals are at an advanced stage of development by my Department for the introduction of a national licensing system.  This will provide for a mandatory system of licensing for public and private health service providers. <br\/><br\/>- Much of the legislation governing healthcare professionals has been extensively updated and amended in recent years with the publication of a number of relevant Acts including the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011. <br\/><br\/><b>- 'Patient Safety First'<\/b>is an awareness raising initiative through which healthcare organisations declare their ongoing commitment to patient safety.The overall branding was supported by a new Patient Safety First logo and the launch of anew website (<b><i>www.patientsafetyfirst.ie<\/i><\/b><i>.)<\/i><br\/><br\/>- The  establishment by the HSE of the Directorate of Quality and Patient Safety in order to strengthen the HSE&rsquo;s internal quality and risk framework.<br\/><br\/>Establishment of HSE's National  Incident Management Team.<br\/><br\/>- The establishment by the HSE of its  Advocacy Unit, the publication of the HSE's Patient Charter '<b>You and Your Health Service<\/b>' and the launch of the <b>WHO's Patient Safety Champion's Network<\/b>.  <br\/><br\/><b>- <\/b>A National Policy on Open Disclosure was developed jointly by the HSE and the State Claims Agency and launched in November 2013.  Implementation of the policy across all health and social services has now commenced by the HSE. <br\/><br\/>- The Royal College of Physicians in Ireland and the HSE have jointly set up the <b>Clinical Programmes<\/b>to provide strategic leadership to develop and roll out models of best practice in clinical care nationally.<br\/><br\/>- The upgrading by the Clinical Indemnity Scheme of the national confidential web-based clinical incident reporting system, STARSweb to the National Adverse Event Management System (NAEMS).  <br\/><br\/>Many of these patient safety initiatives have made significant progress in terms of legislative, regulatory and structural changes.  Changing culture and developing processes for patient safety are critical to delivery of a quality safe healthcare service.  A quality and safety culture ensures that quality and safety is seen as fundamental to every person working within that service, including clinical and non-clinical staff, healthcare managers and the Board, or equivalent, of an organisation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000075#WRY01100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1121,"content":"<p>Question No. 464 answered with Question No. 332.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Data","counter":1122,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000075#WRY01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1123,"qnumday":465,"qnumall":"[37144\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000075#WRY01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the costs associated with the employment of agency staff at all levels throughout the health sector, the degree to which savings may be made by the appointment of temporary, part-time or full-time staff in lieu thereof; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1124,"content":"<p>In the Health Sector which provides 24\/7 care 365 days of the year, flexibility is required that allows the use of overtime and agency staff to meet agreed and approved service levels. Recourse to overtime or agency is necessary for a variety of reasons including, for example, over-runs in operating theatres, sudden increases in service demand, to cover for sick leave, annual leave and maternity leave.  However, the HSE is focused on reducing current levels of agency usage recognising that the increase in agency spending to date this year, up 42% to the end of July compared with 2013, is unsustainable. <\/p><p>  In order to mitigate the impact on frontline services of the reduction in employment numbers that has been required, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.  Agency staff cannot be used to substitute for staff losses as a result of the need to reduce health sector employment. The revised working arrangements provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement are a pivotal element in this regard.

These monthly reports detail activity and financial performance in the HSE under each of its Divisional Areas and provide an assessment of the key expenditure trends across the health services.<\/p><p>  This year is, undoubtedly, proving to be a particularly challenging year for the health services and this is reflected in the overrun to end July of &euro;286 million.  The Department of Health has already signalled that the health service is facing a possible financial overrun of around &euro;500 million this year.  Areas which are showing particular difficulty staying within budget include the Acute Hospital sector (57% of the overall deficit) and the Primary Care sector (19%).<\/p><p>  Much comment has been made about waiting lists following the publication of the latest Performance Assurance Report.  The success of the Outpatient waiting list initiative, facilitated in part through appointments during additional working hours, made available through the Haddington Road Agreement, has had the consequence of increasing in-patient and day-case waiting lists, as people who have been seen as out-patients are referred on to such lists for further treatment as required.<\/p><p>  Hospitals have endeavoured to respond to these developments, in addition to managing service demands arising from admissions through Emergency Departments; this is evident in higher in-patient and day case discharge activity to date in 2014.  Measures to make use of all available capacity and to drive evidence-based best practice health-care for optimum outcomes are being developed by the HSE, in collaboration with acute hospitals, the SDU and the NTPF.  These include:<\/p><p>  &middot; Strict observation of the National Waiting List Protocol (2014), including strict adherence to chronological scheduling and bi-annual validation of lists for all patients waiting more than 3 months<\/p><p>  -  Adherence to relevant HSE National Clinical Programme guidelines<\/p><p>  -  Flexible usage of theatre capacity within specialties<\/p><p>  -  Prioritising Day-of-surgery admission where clinically appropriate<\/p><p>  - \tImplementation of pre-admission clinics to ensure that patients are fit for surgery <\/p><p>  In addition, the availability of acute hospital beds is significantly constrained in that a significant number of patients who are deemed medically fit for discharge are awaiting alternative care arrangements in the community in the form of long term nursing home care, respite care or transitional care.  A co-ordinated approach to delayed discharges between Acute and Social Care Divisions of the HSE is underway to reduce the number of people awaiting placements to nursing homes or home, depending on their personal requirements.  Despite this initiative, the HSE indicates that the numbers of patients awaiting discharge will continue to increase over the next number of months thus reducing in-patient capacity for winter months.<\/p><p>  The funding pressures in primary care are mainly related to local demand led schemes, PCRS and legacy child-care expenditure.  However, positive developments include the fact that waiting times for physiotherapists and occupational therapists have decreased and there has also been improvement in end of life care and childhood health surveillance. <\/p><p>  There has been understandable focus recently on the challenging resource constraints within which the health services are operating.  While the budgetary targets this year are particularly constrained, it is important to recognise that financial and resource constraints have applied in each of the last number of years as a direct consequence of the emergency financial situation the Government has had to address during its period in office.  These challenges come at a time when the demand for health services is increasing each year which, in turn, is driving costs upwards.  However, despite these resource reductions and increasing service demands the HSE has managed to support growing demand for its services arising from such factors as population growth, increased levels of chronic disease, the ageing of the population, increased demand for prescription drugs, and new cost intensive medical technologies and treatments.  The HSE and its staff are to be commended for their ongoing efforts to meet these increased demands on its services since 2008.<\/p><p>  I have already stated that I am hopeful that next year things will be improving in regards to HSE waiting times and budget overruns.

HCAIs represent a major cause of preventable harm and increased healthcare costs. <br\/><br\/>As the Deputy will be aware, the prevalence of MRSA has dropped considerably in recent years.  There has been a decrease of 62.5% in reported cases of MRSA from 2006 to 2013; first-quarter returns for 2014 see a minor rise compared to quarter 1 of 2013 but it must be  stressed that these figures are provisional.  There are, however, concerns about the rates of resistance of other organisms as detailed in the EARS- Net Report referenced below.  While the reducing trend in reported rates of MRSA in Ireland is welcome, MRSA rates are comparably high with other countries and we must systematically build our actions and processes to continue to reduce the prevalence of MRSA in this country. <br\/><br\/>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collates information from acute public and private hospitals on healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistant organisms such as MRSA,<i>Clostridium difficile <\/i>etc.The most recent European Antimicrobial Surveillance System Report (EARS - Net) for Quarter 1, 2014 was published on June 17th.The full Report is available at .<br\/><br\/>The HSE has implemented a number of national initiatives in the control and prevention of HCAIs over many years, more recently the HSE's National Clinical Programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR which commenced in late 2010 and is supported by the national RCPI\/HSE Clinical Advisory Group on HCAIs which provides expert guidance and leadership to the health system.  The overall aim of the National Clinical Programme is that every healthcare worker and all parts of the healthcare system recognise that the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR is a key element of clinical and non-clinical governance.  The programme focuses on getting three basic practices right every time patients are cared for; these are hand hygiene,  using antimicrobials appropriately (antimicrobial stewardship) &amp;amp; preventing medical device-related infections i.e., IV lines\/drips, urinary catheters.  If the above three measures are applied consistently and reliably every time healthcare workers care for their patients\/residents\/client then a significant proportion of HCAIs, including that caused by AMR will be prevented. <br\/><br\/>Public reporting of HCAIs and AMR in Irish acute hospitals includes:<br\/><br\/>- HCAIs Prevalence Study 2006 and 2012<br\/><br\/><i>- S. aureus <\/i>bloodstream infection (reported quarterly since 2007) &ndash; this includes public reporting of MRSA rates per hospital.  Arrangements have now been made for monthly collection of new cases of C. Difficile and - Staphylococcus bloodstream infection rates which will inform future HSE Service Plans <br\/><br\/>- Alcohol hand rub consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007)<br\/><br\/>- Antibiotic consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007)<br\/><br\/>- Hand hygiene compliance (reported bi-annually since 2011)<br\/><br\/>In December last my predecessor launched and endorsed the second National Clinical Guideline, Prevention and Control Methicillin-Resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus <\/i>(MRSA).This National Clinical Guideline provides practical guidance on prevention and control measures for MRSA to improve patient care, minimise patient morbidity and mortality and to help contain healthcare costs.  The guideline has been developed for all healthcare staff involved in the care of patients, residents or clients who may be at risk of or may have MRSA in acute hospitals, obstetrics and neonates, nursing homes\/long stay residential units and the community.  <br\/><br\/>The Department is ensuring that Patient Safety remains a priority within the HSE's Annual Service Plan through specific measures focused on quality and patient safety including HCAIs, Medication safety and implementation of Early Warning Score systems.  My officials meet the HSE each month on the Service Plan and patient safety is a standing item on that agenda.<br\/><br\/>There are no comparative statistics for the private sector regarding initiatives to prevent hospital infections; reporting of HCAIs to the HPSC covers all acute hospitals, both public and private, in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000075#WRY02700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ebola Outbreak","counter":1137,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000075#WRY02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1138,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[37158\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000075#WRY02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department, along with the Health Service Executive, are putting in place systems to enable health professionals to work on a short-term basis in west Africa to assist in the efforts to deal with the Ebola outbreak; if similar arrangements will be put in place to those established by the NHS in Britain; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1139,"content":"<p>Ireland is very supportive of measures to fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

In the area of older people&rsquo;s services and supports, for example, the Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is under way, the Single Assessment Tool has been developed and will be rolled out, measures are being taken to ensure integrated care for older patients, and palliative care services are being improved. <\/p><p>  As part of the implementation process, a Healthy and Positive Ageing Outcomes Initiative has been established as a joint initiative of the Department of Health, the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies. The Initiative will run from October 2014 to December 2017, and will include the development of indicators to monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing at national and local level associated with the implementation of the National Positive Ageing Strategy and the Healthy Ireland Framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000075#WRY03600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1146,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000075#WRY03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1147,"qnumday":474,"qnumall":"[37171\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000075#WRY03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress to date in the determination of an application for a medical card in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1148,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible. <br\/><br\/>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

Our policy on International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, which was launched last year, clearly states our commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA),  and to making further progress towards it when economic circumstances permit.  <\/p><p>  Despite the extremely difficult economic circumstances, we have successfully managed to stabilise the budget for development assistance over the past three years.  Since 2011 we have allocated a total of over &euro;2.5 billion for ODA.  We provided &euro;657 million in 2011, &euro;629 million in 2012, and&euro;637 million in 2013.  For 2014 we will spend some &euro;600 million on ODA.  These are substantial allocations of public funds and represent a genuine investment on behalf of the Irish people in assisting those less fortunate than ourselves.  They are also clear evidence of the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to the aid programme.<\/p><p>  The estimates process for Budget 2015 is now in its finals stages. As with allocations to all Government Departments, Budget 2015 allocations for ODA will be framed in the context of our policy commitments and the overall budgetary circumstances we face.  The final 2015 Budget allocation, which is ultimately a decision for Government, will be announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on 14 October.  As I have stated publicly, and in response to earlier Questions, I and the Minster for Foreign Affairs and Trade have made, and will continue to make, the strongest case possible for the allocation to the development assistance programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000076#WRZ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Agreements","counter":1164,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000076#WRZ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1165,"qnumday":479,"qnumall":"[36830\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000076#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he is satisfied with the level of input by his Department to the proposed Irish ratification of the EU free trade agreement with Colombia and Peru; the degree to which his Department has been consulted in formulating the Government position; the extent to which he believes the ratification complies with the One World, One Future document signed off by the Cabinet in May last year which commits the Government to greater coherence across Government policy in support of development objectives; if he will support further debate in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the issue before deciding to ratify the agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1166,"content":"<p>The Free Trade agreement between the European Union and its member states on the one part and the Republic of Colombia and the Republic of Peru on the other is an agreement within the meaning of Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Constitution.

On 21 September the World Health Organisation estimated the total number of cases in the region at over 6,200, with more than 2,900 deaths so far.  The epidemic shows no signs of abating and the UN has stated that, in addition to the devastating affect it has already had on economic development in the most-affected countries, it is also a threat to security, governance and political stability in the region.<\/p><p>  Ireland is strongly supporting the efforts of the international community to provide a speedy, comprehensive and effective response to this crisis.  Ireland was one of the co-sponsors of a UN Security Council resolution on Ebola adopted on 18 September, which led to the establishment of a new UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response - UNMEER.  Under the auspices of UNMEER, the UN Secretary General has now launched the UN Ebola Multi-Partner Trust Fund in order to unite the efforts of the international community and UN organisations and to act as a platform for the global control of the Ebola outbreak.  The Secretary General&rsquo;s Special Envoy on Ebola, David Nabarro, issued a call on 24 September for funding of &euro;1 billion.  On 25 September, a High Level Meeting was held at the UN in New York to focus world attention on the crisis.<\/p><p>  The European Council considered the crisis at its special meeting on 30 August and called for increased response co-ordination across the Member States.  A comprehensive EU response framework is now in place and the EU has so far pledged &euro;180 million for the fight against Ebola, in addition to individual Member State contributions.  EU mobile laboratories are already deployed in the region to help with the diagnosis and confirmation of cases and to train laboratory technicians.  EU funding will also be used to strengthen local healthcare systems and improve food security, water and sanitation.  <\/p><p>  During the UN High Level Event on the 25 September it was stressed that medical evacuation and transport are two major bottlenecks in the Ebola response effort.  The EU is also actively considering the coordination of Member State military and civilian assets to support the evacuation of patients from the region.<\/p><p>  The two countries most seriously affected by the Ebola crisis, Liberia and Sierra Leone, are partner countries for Ireland&rsquo;s development aid programme.  We have already provided humanitarian funding of &euro;350,000 direct to NGOs working on the Ebola response.  Last week I announced additional funding of &euro;660,000 for UNICEF to enable it to provide life-saving nutritional supplies to children who have been affected by the crisis.  <\/p><p>  My Department has also been working through the UN Humanitarian Response Depot in Accra, Ghana, to mobilise 42 tonnes of pre-positioned Irish humanitarian supplies for distribution to those most affected, including survivors and vulnerable children.  A member of Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps has also been deployed to Dakar, Senegal, and is working with the World Food Programme in setting up an air transit centre for use by the UN Humanitarian Air Service.<\/p><p>  This funding and support is in addition to our ongoing development programmes in Sierra Leone and Liberia, where we are providing a total of some &euro;10 million, a considerable proportion of which will be re-directed to fighting the spread of the virus and establishing further treatment facilities.  We are also providing very significant funding for the long term development work of our NGO partners in the countries, last year amounting to over &euro;6 million.  <\/p><p>  I fully share the serious concerns about this crisis and I am satisfied that the international community is now fully seized of the need to act quickly, decisively and generously in bringing the outbreak under control and eventually eliminating the disease.  I am planning to visit Freetown this week to gain a personal understanding of the local and regional impact of the Ebola crisis.  I will also be reviewing the Irish Aid programmes in Sierra Leone and Liberia and considering what more Ireland can do to help these countries and people that are so badly affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000076#WRZ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1174,"content":"<p>Question No. 485 answered with Question No. 478.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies","counter":1175,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000076#WRZ01325"},{"type":"question","counter":1176,"qnumday":486,"qnumall":"[37206\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000076#WRZ01350","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide in tabular form all the State agencies, bodies, organisations and working groups under his Department's remit; the core duties and functions of each; the number of staff in each; the budget of each for 2013 and the proposed budget for 2014; the date of establishment of the agencies or organisations; and the legislation, primary or otherwise, from which they derive their powers.","asker":"1110","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1177,"content":"<p>There are no State agencies, bodies or organisations under the aegis of my Department.

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The Staffing arrangements for primary schools includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional classroom posts on developing grounds. Donaghpatrick National Schools has been provisionally approved for 1 developing classroom post based on the projected enrolment of 125 pupils provided by the school. This post will be substantiated if the school reaches a minimum of 123 pupils enrolled on the 30 September, 2014. If substantiated, this will bring the total classroom teaching posts in the school  to five.<br\/><br\/>  The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria, including developing grounds, to an independent Appeals Board.<br\/><br\/>In addition, the staffing appeals process at primary level has been extended to allow schools that are not gaining an additional teaching post under the developing schools criterion to submit an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. This appeal criterion is targeted at those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places and so assist the response to demographic growth within their area and, as a result, are under significant pressure on their class sizes at infants level. Circular 0007\/2014 provides details for schools wishing to make an appeal. <br\/><br\/>  Donaghpatrick National School submitted an appeal to the February, 2014 meeting of the Primary Staffing Appeals Board under this new criterion &ndash; alleviating some of the pressures on class sizes. The Appeal Board considered the application on 26 February 2014 and determined that the application did not satisfy all of the published criteria as set out in circular 0007\/2014.<br\/><br\/>The next meeting of the Primary Staffing Appeals Board will be held in October, 2014.

The mentoring of the JobBridge intern is a matter for the employer. <\/p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030\/2014. <\/p><p>  Once an SNA allocation has been made, the recruitment and deployment of SNAs are matters for the individual employer. The allocation of SNA support can change from year to year and may increase or decrease as students who qualify for SNA support enrol, leave or care needs change. <\/p><p>  The aim of JobBridge is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills. Participation in the JobBridge scheme is entirely voluntary and schools may apply for internships in whichever area they deem appropriate.  Participating schools must comply with Department of Social Protection requirements for Host Organisations and also with the guidelines issued by my Department.<\/p><p>  The Department of Social Protection have informed me that in order to protect the JobBridge intern and to ensure the integrity of JobBridge, they have introduced a variety of control measures and criteria. These ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position; that it provides appropriate training and development experience; and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the intern.  In addition to the initial vetting of advertisements and the requirement for the host organisation to participate in monthly compliance reporting, the Department of Social Protection has on-going monitoring of internships.  This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and the conducting of monitoring site visits to facilitate discussions with both parties to the internship.  These monitoring visits comprise a combination of randomised visits\/inspections with host organisations and of the investigation of complaints received from interns or concerned individuals.<\/p><p>  The Department of Social Protection also applies a six-month cooling off period to host organisations upon the completion of an internship. This cooling off period prohibits organisations from taking on an intern in the same area of activity as the previous internship for a period of six months, except where the intern moves directly into employment. This prevents organisations from perpetually filling a role with consecutive interns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000077#WRAA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":1258,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000078#WRBB00250"},{"type":"question","counter":1259,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[36873\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000078#WRBB00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the criteria which are being adhered to by the National Council for Special Education special educational needs organisers when allocating special needs assistant support for special educational needs pupils; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":1260,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[36874\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000078#WRBB00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the research processes which were followed by her Department in regard to the drafting of Circular 0030\/2014; if relevant parties\/groups were involved or consulted in advance of the circular being issued; if the circular has been sufficiently circulated to relevant parties; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1261,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 515 and 516 together.<br\/><br\/>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school.  Where children have significant care needs whereby they may need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.<br\/><br\/>  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030\/2014, which issued to schools on 10th April 2014 and is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.<br\/><br\/>  This Circular clarifies and restates the purpose of the SNA scheme i.e. to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.<br\/><br\/>  The circular is based on recommendations contained in my Departments Value for Money and Policy Review of the SNA scheme and also the National Council for Special Education Policy Advice on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools.<br\/><br\/>  Both reports concluded that the SNA scheme has been highly successful in supporting the care needs of children with special needs in schools, and with assisting to facilitate their integration and inclusion.  However, the reports also concluded that the intended purpose of the scheme was not always generally well understood by parents or schools and that the scope and purpose of the scheme should be clarified for schools.<br\/><br\/>  In developing both of these policy review papers my Department and the NCSE consulted widely with education partners and stakeholders, including parents of children with special educational needs.  <br\/><br\/>  The Circular was developed taking into account the recommendations contained in these policy advice papers and in conjunction with the NCSE, the National Educational Psychological Services and my Department's Inspectorate division.<br\/><br\/>  Following the publication of the circular, officials at my Department held a series of meetings with stakeholders, including parents of children with special needs, to discuss this Circular with them and to clarify any concerns that they may have had. <br\/><br\/>  My Department has also asked the NCSE to prepare an Information Booklet for parents in relation to the SNA scheme which it is hoped will be available shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000078#WRBB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Applications","counter":1262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000078#WRBB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1263,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[36877\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000078#WRBB00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which she has received submissions from the authorities at Hewetson School, Millicent Road, Clane, County Kildare, in respect of extra facilities required thereat; if a schedule and time frame has been agreed; the full extent of the proposed provisions by way of upgrading the existing school facilities or replacement on the existing site; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1264,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that the school to which he refers has an application with my Department for large scale capital funding.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water is responsible for public water services and can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation, the CER, which has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers of Irish Water.<br\/><br\/>In advance of the introduction of domestic water charges, the Government made certain decisions on 6 May 2014 relating to the structure of water charges including, inter alia, a free allowance per household and an additional free allowance for children on the same qualifying conditions as the Child Benefit payment from the Department of Social Protection.<br\/><br\/>As these allowances are to be funded by Government, Irish Water needs to ensure it has the appropriate and sufficient information to reflect these entitlements.Irish Water is a specified body under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended by Section 20 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014, and is therefore permitted to request PPS numbers to authenticate the identity of the person being provided with an allowance.<br\/><br\/>Irish Water will treat applicants&rsquo; personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. In complying with these Acts, Irish Water must ensure that the data is only used for the purpose it was collected and must also ensure that any data collected is stored securely. The collection of Personal Public Services (PPS) numbers allows Irish Water to confirm and validate the entitlement to allowances for each customer. This information will not be shared with any organisation other than the Department of Social Protection for the purpose of verification, to ensure that each household receives the allowances it is entitled to, be it the free allowance per household or any additional allowance for children in receipt of Child Benefit at that address. It will also allow Irish Water to provide lower charges to owners who have unoccupied dwellings.<br\/><br\/>With charges effective from 1 October 2014 Irish Water is in the process of compiling the relevant data to ensure that customers can be billed accurately based on the tariff structure approved by the CER. Throughout September, Irish Water has been sending application packs to approximately 2 million households, which refer to the effective charging date and the fact that billing for domestic customers in receipt of public water services will start in January 2015. The application process will enable customers to confirm their details for billing and, by providing the relevant PPS numbers, claim the allowances that they are eligible for. Irish Water have confirmed that there will be no repercussions for withholding telephone numbers or email addresses on the application. <br\/><br\/>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has today made a determination on the water charges plan, submitted to it by Irish Water, which sets out the position if customers do not validate their details. In these circumstances, a default charge which does not include the free allowances will be applied to such customers.\u00a0 The relevant details of the determination are available on its website ().<br\/><br\/>Irish Water has an ongoing engagement with the Data Protection Commissioner and has advised my Department that it has been asked to provide clarity on some aspects of the legal language of its data protection notice as published on its website, .<br\/><br\/>It has confirmed that this notice was, and is , fully compliant with data protection requirements . However, by providing additional clarity ,it will re-assure customers that data is held securely, used properly and not shared with third parties, except where necessary for the delivery of water services such as contractors repairing leaks. Any advice given to Irish Water from the Data Protection Commissioner will be further incorporated into its data protection notice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000080#WRDD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local and Community Development Programme Project Funding","counter":1368,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000080#WRDD00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1369,"qnumday":551,"qnumall":"[36555\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000080#WRDD01000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to ring-fence funding to support the National Collective of Community Based Women's Networks to deliver the only programme specifically targeted at women form disadvantaged communities; and his further plans to provide support for this most marginalised group who are not named under the SICAP programme.

The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281m over that period.\u00a0 It is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014 with a budget of &euro;47m pending the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in April 2015.<br\/><br\/>Some 17 Women&rsquo;s Projects under the remit of the National Collective of Community Based Women's Networks (NCCWN) currently receive annual funding of &euro;1.3 million under the LCDP. In addition, my Department also supports a number of Women&rsquo;s projects under the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO). This funding scheme, which supports national organisations in the community and voluntary sector, aims to provide multi-annual funding towards core costs associated with the provision of services. A new round of funding under this scheme commenced on 1 July 2014, under which the NCCWN\u00a0 was allocated some &euro;160,122 for the two year period of 1 July 2014 &ndash; 30 June 2016.<br\/><br\/>The SICAP is one of my key priorities and its budget for next year will be decided in the 2015 Estimates process. The Programme&rsquo;s target groups are:<br\/><br\/>- Children and Families from Disadvantaged Areas<br\/><br\/>- Lone Parents<br\/><br\/>- New Communities (including Refugees\/Asylum Seekers)<br\/><br\/>- People living in Disadvantaged Communities<br\/><br\/>- People with Disabilities<br\/><br\/>- Roma<br\/><br\/>- The Unemployed (including those not on the Live Register)<br\/><br\/>- Travellers<br\/><br\/>- Young Unemployed People from Disadvantaged areas<br\/><br\/>In accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of the services to clients, the Programme is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently underway.\u00a0 Stage one (Expression of Interest) has been completed. Stage two (Invitation to Tender), will get underway in October and will involve the successful applicants from Stage one being invited to apply to one or more Local Community Development Committees, in Local Authority areas, to deliver the programme. Contracts for SICAP will be determined following the outcome of the procurement process.<br\/><br\/>The public procurement process is a competitive process that is open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme. In Stage one, joint applications were encouraged and organisations of varying sizes (for example smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations) were invited to submit joint applications. That said, I understand that some small groups, such as the groups under the remit of the NCCWN, faced a number of challenges in competing in the Stage one process. The results of Stage one were released on 24 September and I can confirm that none of the NCCWN groups expressed an interest either as lead applicants or as part of a consortium. I am now considering the implications of that for NCCWN and will conclude that consideration as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000080#WRDD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Guidelines","counter":1379,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000080#WRDD01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1380,"qnumday":555,"qnumall":"[36568\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000080#WRDD02000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will set a new limit on the distance between wind turbines and places of residence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"966","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1381,"content":"<p>My Department commenced a public consultation in December 2013 on proposed &ldquo;draft&rdquo; revisions to the existing 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines focusing specifically on the issues of noise, setbacks and shadow flicker.

Details of commercial services available in each county can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual operators.<\/p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS). Following a competitive tendering process, my Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS. The Scheme offered a basic and affordable broadband service to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated rural areas where the extent of broadband coverage by commercial operators, at the time the Scheme was launched in 2008, was deemed to be inadequate. EU State Aid approval was granted for a scheme of limited duration. As a consequence, following a 68 month operational period, the Scheme expired on 25th August 2014.<\/p><p>  &ldquo;3&rdquo; have confirmed that, following the expiry of the Scheme, they will continue to provide coverage throughout NBS areas on a commercial basis offering consumers the same choice of Broadband plans and tariffs as those offered to consumers outside of the NBS areas. Furthermore, they have also informed my Department of their plans to extend 4G coverage across all of the NBS Coverage Areas within the next 3 years.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s Statement of Priorities for the period 2014 to 2016 reaffirms our commitment to delivering a State-led broadband intervention in rural areas.

The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) advice is that the eel stock continues to decline and urgent action is needed.  ICES advice is that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pollution) should be reduced to as close to zero as possible until there is clear evidence that both recruitment and the adult stock are increasing.  In 2011, glass eel recruitment fell to 5% of their 1960-1979 level in the Atlantic region and less than 1% in the North Sea area, and showed no sign of recovery.<\/p><p>  In 2012, as required by the EU, who approved Ireland's EMP in 2009, a review of the management of eel in Ireland, including a scientific review by the independent Scientific Committee, was undertaken.  This process included a robust public consultation during which many issues were raised and considered.  Full details of the outputs of the public consultation are available on the IFI website.<\/p><p>  While I fully recognise the difficulty facing eel fishermen, the review of scientific and management advice and inputs from the public consultation informed a decision to continue with the cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market for the period from 2012 to 2015. Ireland&rsquo;s EMP will again be fully reviewed in 2015 from both scientific and management perspectives.<\/p><p>  The very significant decline in the stock dictated that closure of the fishery be applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts and there is no property right attaching to public eel licences and consequently the issue of compensatory payment is not relevant.<\/p><p>  Given that context, in the current national economic circumstances it is unlikely that funding will be available to the Government to provide for such payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000083#WRGG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"997"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Postcode System Establishment","counter":1499,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000083#WRGG00450"},{"type":"question","counter":1500,"qnumday":606,"qnumall":"[37032\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000083#WRGG00500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide an update regarding the geo coding project; when he expects it to be operational and the cost of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1501,"content":"<p>The design for the National Postcode System was approved by Government last April.

The Act provides for further Graduated Driver Licensing measures, adjustments to the penalty points system, increasing demerits for the most dangerous offences such as speeding and operating a mobile phone while driving.<\/p><p>  My officials are also in the early stages of drafting the Road Traffic Bill 2014 which will contain further measures to improving safety on our roads.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the actions set out in the Road Safety Strategy will be sufficient to allow Ireland to continue to make progress towards the objectives of reducing road deaths set out in the Strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000084#WRHH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus &Eacute;ireann Services","counter":1555,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000084#WRHH00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1556,"qnumday":625,"qnumall":"[36959\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000084#WRHH00800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"to set out his views on an application to amend Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway route number 7, which is intended to abandon historic population centres such as Ballyporeen, Moneygall, Clogheen, Castlecomer, Crettyard, Ardfinnan and others, and which is before the National Transport Authority at present; his further views on whether the route in question is the only publicly operated connection between those population centres and Dublin and Cork cities; if he will undertake to prevent this further act of abandonment and isolation of rural communities by guaranteeing a level of service which the communities themselves find acceptable.","asker":"1022","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":1557,"content":"<p>The issue raised is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0and I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.\u00a0 Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000084#WRHH00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Recruitment","counter":1558,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000084#WRHH00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1559,"qnumday":626,"qnumall":"[36984\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000084#WRHH01000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when there will be an end to the freeze in taking on permanent staff in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann; and if he has a role in the matter.","asker":"1011","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":1560,"content":"<p>The issue raised is a human resources matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the company for direct reply.\u00a0 Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000084#WRHH01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Promotion","counter":1561,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000084#WRHH01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1562,"qnumday":627,"qnumall":"[36987\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000084#WRHH01200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"in view of the fact that more than 180,000 persons work directly in the tourism industry and in view of the decline in tourism, especially from overseas, if he will expand the marketing of Ireland abroad, especially in emerging countries facing a surge in outward tourists due to economic development since the turn of the century; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":1563,"content":"<p>CSO figures show that, while visitor numbers to Ireland fell significantly in 2009 and 2010,\u00a0there has been a strong recovery in the performance of the tourism sector\u00a0from 2011 onwards.

The extent of the problem varies from area to area within the National Park and the programme and the control methods used are regularly reviewed and refined to respond to the dynamic and vigorous nature of the plant in order to mitigate its impact throughout the Park. While a wide range of control methods are considered for this purpose, those chosen are generally selected on the basis of optimum efficacy, having regard to the most effective use of available resources.<br\/><br\/>Since 2011, my Department has invested c. &euro;500,000 in this programme, with an additional &euro;100,000 invested in the programme this year. Approximately 3,000 of the 10,000 hectares in the Park were, to some extent, affected by <i>Rhododendron <\/i>infestation. My Department&rsquo;s management programme has made significant inroads into the problem and now approx. 2,000 of those hectares, involving some 40 different sites, are under effective control.<br\/><br\/>The work involved is arduous and resource intensive and is carried out by outside specialist companies, Department staff and by volunteer groups under staff direction and supervision. In this regard, my Department recognises the past and continuing important contribution of volunteer groups to this work, and also the innovative work of Department staff in Killarney National Park who have been instrumental in developing new methods to control this plant.<br\/><br\/>Ultimately, the plan is to clear all <i>Rhododendron<\/i>from the Park. The management programme is intended to create conditions in the Park that are conducive to the protection and re-establishment of native species and, particularly, Ireland&rsquo;s native woodlands. My Department is committed to this important and challenging work and will continue to engage with volunteer groups who are willing to assist my Department with its Rhododendron management programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000084#WRHH03200","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Monuments","counter":1592,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000084#WRHH03250"},{"type":"question","counter":1593,"qnumday":638,"qnumall":"[36693\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014093000084#WRHH03300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"to explain the position regarding jointly funding the purchase of the Motte in Granard, County Longford; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1594,"content":"<p>Although in private ownership, Granard motte and bailey is a national monument in the guardianship of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under the National Monuments Acts 1930-2004.
