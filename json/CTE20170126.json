At an oral hearing I attended, as pointed out last week at a massive rally which was covered by RTE, the views and considerations of Oireachtas Members and councillors were not recorded in a decision made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The points raised in the correspondence are legitimate.  I have examples of weekly advertisements across all print media platforms.  EirGrid sponsors radio shows on LMFM and expends significant moneys in sponsoring local and national GAA events.  However, that will not be much good when there are 400 pylons running across the three counties that will be impacted on, devastating the lives of the people living in them.

I suggest we consider the matter next week and put the Department on notice that we will specifically raise it when we deal with the Ballymun regeneration programme.  It involves the use of pyrite.

It is about the wards of court issue which was dealt with extensively by the previous committee.  At one of our first meetings last year we received a minute from the Department on the previous committee&rsquo;s report on wards of court.  The Department explained that it was looking at how the fund was being looked at.  I propose that we write to it to look at developments in the light of the minute given to us.  I also propose that we forward a copy of the latest correspondence on the review that has taken place and look for a response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.

However, we can still try to be as constructive as possible in the matter.<\/p><p>I return item No. 125C.  It was agreed at our meeting of 11 November to return to this item which concerns a letter received from an individual about Horse Racing Ireland.  This and the previous committee, as well as several politicians and committees, have been approached by the person in question on several occasions.  We also agreed to refer the matter to the Parliamentary Legal Adviser&rsquo;s office, with all of the correspondence received from the individual since the start of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il, to make a decision on if and how we could progress it further.<\/p><p>The clerk has been in touch with the Parliamentary Legal Adviser whose advice is that Horse Racing Ireland as a body audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General is accountable to this committee in respect only of its audited financial accounts.  It is not the role of the Committee of Public Accounts to investigate the handling of complaints by such a body in respect of a specific individual or to become involved in resolving individual complaints between citizens and the body concerned.  <\/p><p> In addition, and perhaps more importantly,  the individual refers in correspondence that letters exhibited by him will be used in High Court case number 2015\/10553\/P.  The Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser has checked the court listings and it appears that the person initiated proceedings on 16 December 2015 against Ireland, the Attorney General, the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner and that his case is listed for hearing on 23 March 2017.  Therefore, it would also be in breach of Standing Order 59 of the Standing Orders for this committee to engage with any party to live proceedings.  A copy of a draft letter is on members' screens.<\/p><p> I propose we write to the individual in question informing him of same and that we will be returning any future correspondence in relation to the matter to him.  Could members take a moment to look at the letter we are proposing which has, essentially, been drafted by the Parliamentary Legal Adviser?  There are live court proceedings on the matter and the Parliamentary Legal Adviser is telling us that we should not be dealing with it.  Does anyone wish to comment on the letter or can we agree?  I will give members a moment to look at it.  There has been extensive correspondence.  It is the person's right to write to us and bring these matters to our attention but after considering the matter since December, the Parliamentary Legal Adviser has recommended that we do not deal with it.  We gave a commitment that we would try to deal with it before the end of January.  Do members have any comments or do they agree or disagree with the contents?  Can we get approval for the clerk to issue that letter on behalf of the committee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017012600002#B01300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485421200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I approve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017012600002#C00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1485421200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Has everyone read it?

That completes the review today of the accounts received since the last meeting.<\/p><p> The next item on the agenda is our work programme.  This takes into account some of the items discussed the last day.  The Department of Defence will be here today and next Thursday the Department of Justice and Equality will be before us to deal with a special report from the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding annual hours in the Irish Prison Service.  Savings were expected but did not fully materialise.  We will have the appropriation account for the Irish Prison Service.  The following Thursday we have nothing specific.  We had hoped to have the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government but it cannot come in so that may be a very useful week to complete our work on Project Eagle if we have no scheduled meeting.  We might have to have more than one meeting that week to clear our report.  We will hold that meeting open for the time being.<\/p><p> On Thursday, 16 February I am suggesting we deal with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There is a special chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report about levies in the agricultural sector and refunds from the EU.  The following Thursday, 23 February, we will invite the Health Service Executive, HSE, in to deal with two items, the fair deal scheme and patient private property accounts.  We will come back to the HSE on bigger issues but various members have asked to consider these two issues. <\/p><p> On Thursday, 2 March, we will have the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government before us to deal with its annual accounts and the issue in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report about central government's funding of local authorities and progress on the land aggregation scheme.  I know members will want to talk about that issue.  On Thursday, 9 March, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners will be here to discuss all the chapters in the report highlighting different issues, including the review of medical consultants' tax affairs and tax consultants' affairs.  Many names were published in respect of unpaid tax.  There was a chapter on research and development tax credit and deferral of stamp duty liability and the activities of the Revenue in general.  We will skip a week because the D&aacute;il is not sitting.  On Thursday, 23 March, and the following week we will discuss third level institutions.  Will members contact the clerk to the committee on how we will structure that?  We will deal with each institution separately, allocating an hour or two for each one and then move to the next one.  We cannot have six different institutions here at once because some will be skipped.  We will probably have to bring in the Higher Education Authority, HEA, in the opening slot and we will try to structure a work programme with the third level institutions over those two weeks.  Many people have mentioned that.  <\/p><p> On 6 April, we will meet the Department of Finance to discuss the Exchequer financial return, the Government and Department's accounts.  It is normal that the Committee of Public Accounts would have the Department of Finance in to deal with the national debt and financial position.  The Department of Justice and Equality will be here on Thursday, 13 April, to deal with the normal Vote plus the procurement and management of contracts for direct provision.  <\/p><p> I have a note of further items listed that we will give dates for in due course, for example, HSE section 38 and section 39 organisations.  Procurement issues come up every week.  We will have to have a session or two on that area.  There are some other outstanding chapters regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General's report but many of them will have been dealt with.  We may have some space after Easter to pick a few topics between then and summer.  People may want to bring in some Departments not covered in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report to discuss their appropriation accounts.  Is there general agreement on that schedule?  Agreed.  If anyone has comments on it, they can contact the secretariat because it is only a draft schedule and it can move a little as time goes on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017012600002#C03300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485421200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>The HSE decided last night not to challenge a High Court ruling on consultants' pay.

Salaries and allowances for Defence Force personnel, including civilian support staff serving with the military, accounted for 67% of the expenditure.  At the end of the year, just under 10,000 full-time equivalent personnel were employed and remunerated from Vote 36, including just under 9,200 Defence Force personnel.  Expenditure of just over &euro;176 million was incurred on equipment, supplies and other operational costs of the Defence Forces.  Administration costs for the Department of just over &euro;21 million were incurred in the year.  The diagram which members can see now on the screen gives an indication of the relative amounts of expenditure in 2015.  In contrast to other large Votes, the Defence Vote is presented as a single programme.  The detail of spending in note 3 of the account is much the same as that always presented in the past, with the focus on spending by input type.  Most other Votes have moved to output-based accounting, reporting costs for output programmes.  As a result, the Vote account does not give a picture of the costs of particular services provided by the Defence Forces, such as peacekeeping or aid to the civil power.<\/p> <p>  The appropriation account for Vote 35, Army Pensions, recorded gross expenditure of &euro;227 million in 2015.  Over 99% of the expenditure related to payment of pensions and gratuities to former members of the Defence Forces or to surviving dependants.  At the end of the year, just over 12,000 pensions were in payment.  The two appropriation accounts associated with the Defence Forces received clear audit opinions in respect of 2015.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 8 of the report on the accounts of the public services 2015 concerns the circumstances that gave rise to a decision in August 2014 to dispose of the Air Corps' Gulfstream IV jet.  The 14-seater jet was used in the past to provide air transport for the President, members of the Government and accompanying officials undertaking official engagements at home and abroad.  The Air Corps now provides a more limited service using its remaining seven-seater Learjet 45 aircraft.  The Gulfstream jet had been in service since 1992.  The total cost of acquiring the aircraft was approximately &euro;45 million.  It was sold in January 2015 for &euro;418,000.  I asked for an examination of the transaction because of the unusual circumstances in which it occurred and the accounting adjustments it entailed.  <\/p> <p>  Following a ministerial direction in 2010, an annual total maintenance cost of &euro;400,000 was deemed by the Department to represent the upper limit that should be incurred on the Gulfstream jet.  Costs significantly in excess of this threshold were incurred in 2013 due to necessary repairs and to treat corrosion.  A memorandum to Government in July 2014 noted that the aircraft would require an overhaul of both engines by 2018-2019 at an estimated cost of &euro;2.5 million and that retention of the aircraft beyond that date would be unsustainable given its age.  Government approval was obtained for increased maintenance expenditure in 2014, up to a total of &euro;750,000, including a provision of &euro;250,000 for an overhaul of the landing gear during the annual maintenance to be carried out by Gulfstream in the USA.<\/p> <p>  Significant additional repairs were identified during the inspection in July-early August 2014, which increased the total estimated cost for repairs and maintenance on the jet to &euro;1.34 million.  On foot of the escalating costs, the Department sought the views of senior officials within the Air Corps who, while noting the age of the aircraft and the risk of further corrosion or fatigue issues, recommended that it should be repaired and returned to service.  Informal contact was also made by the Department with an Irish aviation consultant company at this time, which advised that an immediate sale of the jet would probably yield less than &euro;750,000 at the prevailing exchange rates.  Gulfstream advised the Department that estimated additional costs to put the aircraft into a serviceable condition prior to a sale would bring the maintenance bill for the year to &euro;1.8 million.  In mid-August 2014, the Minister directed that no further work should be carried out on the aircraft and it should be disposed of for the best possible price.  The Department considered the most viable option at that point was to dispose of the aircraft for salvage and that a public tender competition or auction was not possible because the jet was in a stripped down state in the Gulfstream facility where very high standards of security apply.  Prospective buyers in a sales competition would not have been allowed access to view the aircraft at those premises. <\/p> <p>  In early December 2014, the Department received a letter, via Gulfstream, from a USA based company who offered &euro;418,000 to purchase the aircraft \"as seen\".  This offer was accepted by the Department in January 2015.  The Air Corps also had 87 spare parts for the jet in stock with an original acquisition cost of &euro;1.4 million.  At the end of October 2014, the Air Corps estimated the value of the parts was &euro;405,000.  Ultimately, the parts were sold to the purchaser of the aircraft for &euro;53,000 in February 2015.  The amounts received and the losses on disposal were reflected in the 2015 appropriation account.  I understand the purchaser has further invested in the jet and has returned it to use.  In the absence of a competitive sales process for the Gulfstream jet and the spare parts, it is difficult to conclude whether best value was obtained by the Department.<\/p> <p>  An inter-departmental group has been charged with preparing a report for submission to Government on the future provision of the ministerial air transport service.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017012600002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1485421200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy for his opening statement and I now invite Mr. Maurice Quinn to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017012600002#E00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1485421200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the 2015 appropriation accounts for the Defence and Army Pensions Votes.  The Defence sector is made up of two Votes, \u00a0Vote 35, Army Pensions, and Vote 36, Defence.  The high level goal of both Votes is to provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfil all other roles assigned by Government.  This is achieved across three strategic dimensions: defence policy, ensuring the capacity to deliver and Defence Forces operational outputs.  The Government's defence policy for the next decade has been set out in the White Paper on Defence, which was published in August 2015.<\/p> <p>  Some 68% of the Defence Vote in 2015 provided for the pay and allowances of the Permanent Defence Force, civilian employees and civil servants, as well as the Reserve Defence Force.  The non-pay allocation provided addresses capability development and operational outputs and includes both current and capital elements.  Non-pay current expenditure of &euro;123 million in 2015 provided mainly for essential and ongoing Defence Forces standing and operational costs such as utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training.\u00a0 Capital expenditure of &euro;89 million provided for equipment purchase and renewal and the ongoing upgrade and refurbishment of military barracks and facilities across the country.  Significant operational outputs include Ireland's contribution to international peace and security, and at home, aid to the civil power.\u00a0 The commitment of personnel to the international domain comprehends peace support operations, under a UN mandate, principally the UNIFIL and UNDOF missions in Lebanon and the Golan Heights, respectively.\u00a0 Ireland now holds the position of Force Commander of UNIFIL.\u00a0<\/p><p>Deputies will also be familiar with the humanitarian mission in the Mediterranean, Operation Pontus, undertaken by the Naval Service.<\/p><p> At home and on a daily basis, the Defence Forces provide a range of supports to the civil power, mainly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to assistance to the principal response agencies in dealing with major emergencies, including the severe weather response, missing persons, fishery protection by the Naval Service and emergency aeromedical support missions by the Air Corps.<\/p><p> The Reserve Defence Force, RDF, plays an important role in supporting the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, mainly through the provision of a capability to be able to augment the PDF in crisis situations.  The 2015 White Paper acknowledged the excellent levels of voluntary service provided by members of the Army and Naval Service reserves.<\/p><p> The Defence Vote contributes funding to the Civil Defence, channelled to local authorities.  Throughout 2015, the Civil Defence was involved in a wide range of activities throughout the country, including a prominent support role in dealing with the flooding in December 2015.  In response to the impact of severe flooding on businesses in late 2015, the Government established a one-off humanitarian payment arrangement for small businesses that could not obtain flood insurance but subsequently suffered flood damage to their premises in the period from December 2015 to January 2016.  An allocation of &euro;5 million was provided to the Irish Red Cross from the Defence Vote to administer the scheme in 2015.<\/p><p> Vote 35 - Army Pensions - provides for pensions benefits for former members of the Defence Forces and the dependants of deceased members.  The expenditure, in its nature, is demand-driven and non-discretionary.  It has increased considerably over recent years, principally in line with the increase in the number of pensioners.  In 2015, 12,128 army pensioners were paid from Vote 35, compared with 11,322 in 2010, an increase of 806 or 7%.  This Vote also provides pensions to widows of veterans of the War of Independence.<\/p><p> A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;6.5 million required in 2015 was met by savings on the Defence Vote.  A distinctive aspect of Army pension administration is that military personnel can retire voluntarily at a time of their own choosing rather than at the normal retirement age.  This is usually with pension benefits that are payable immediately.  This is in contrast to most pensions in the public service which are payable on retirement which, in itself, is normally highly predictable at ages over 60 and for which the cost and timing of liabilities can be estimated with much greater accuracy.<\/p><p> I would now like to refer to Chapter 8 of Volume 2 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report which deals with the disposal of the Government jet.  As recommended by the Comptroller and Auditor General, it is the normal practice of the Department to carry out a formal cost-benefit analysis and a discounted cashflow analysis of life cycle costs which are part of the decision-making process.  It is also established practice to dispose of State assets through a competitive sales process.  In the case of the Government jet, the circumstances were entirely exceptional and decisive action was necessary to assess the relevant options quickly and proceed on the most cost-effective and prudent approach.  The Gulfstream GIV aircraft had been in service since 1992 and was fully depreciated by 2012.  An overhaul of both engines by 2018 or 2019 at an estimate of &euro;2.5 million was going to be required.  The Government noted in July 2014 that retention of the aircraft beyond that would not be sustainable, given its age.  The decision in July 2014 that the jet should be disposed of for the best possible price was triggered by the unexpected estimate for repair and maintenance of &euro;1.34 million.  Disposal for salvage was considered to be the only viable option, given the estimated cost of &euro;1.34 million to repair to a serviceable condition, the absence of any guarantee of future serviceability even after incurring repair costs, the depressed executive jet market conditions and the charges that were accumulating on the service line in the US.<\/p><p> There is no disagreement with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor that an assessment of costs was necessary.  This was undertaken but conditioned in its approach by the exceptional circumstances.  The assessment, governed by the policy approach limiting further financial outlay, together with the uncertainty relating to future serviceability of the aircraft, meant that there was only one course of action available rather than a set of options.  The decision to dispose of the aircraft flowed from this assessment.  The approach to the disposal of the aircraft was necessarily heavily constrained by the circumstances whereby the aircraft was in a stripped-down state in Gulfstream&rsquo;s facility in Savannah, Georgia in the US.  The normal circumstances in which an asset is under the control of the Department and Defence Forces did not apply and additional costs could only arise the longer disposal took.  In January 2015, the Department accepted an offer of &euro;418,000 to purchase the aircraft \"as seen\" from Journey Aviation, a US-based company.  In February, the spare parts which were now redundant were sold to the company for &euro;53,000.  While this differs from their historical value on inventory, it was considered reasonable given that, for the Air Corps, these parts were now redundant and taking account of the nature and age of the parts and the \"as seen\" sales condition.<\/p><p> As Accounting Officer for the Department of Defence, I am satisfied with the value achieved in the sale of the aircraft and spares, given the policy parameters set and the exceptional circumstances involved.  There was considerable risk of additional Exchequer costs if appropriate and timely action was not taken.  Our priority at all times is the best use of the funds available and application of these to provide necessary defence capabilities having regard to Government policy, business requirements and safety considerations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017012600002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485421200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Quinn and now call our first speaker, Deputy Alan Kelly, to be followed by Deputies Noel Rock and David Cullinane.

It is still flying.  On 23 November 2016 it flew from Paris to New York; on 28 November it flew from Allentown to New York; and on 3 December it flew from New York to Barbados.  It is being advertised here and can be leased.  The advert mentions its amenities - a split cabin for privacy, a full service gallery, a full lavatory, a flight phone, an SAT phone, video monitors and stereo system speakers.  There are nice pictures of the inside of the jet.  I was in contact with the company which had bought it and I am waiting for it to get back to me, but I received a copy of the insurance certificate which I have given to the clerk.  It was reregistered as N297PJ and is insured at a value of $5 million.  That seems to be a far cry from the image of a jet in pieces and which had had its day in a hangar in Savannah.

I will refer to the Government jet given that everyone else has spoken about it.  Deputy Cullinane referred to its new owners, Journey Aviation, its destinations, including Paris, and its home base of Palm Beach.  I wish the new owners well.  I looked at the flight history of the Government jet, in particular, the number of times it broke down.  Deputy Cullinane stated the jet flew from New York to Paris under Journey Aviation.  In 1997, only five years after it commenced operations for the State, the Government jet broke down en route to Paris leaving the then Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, on the tarmac.  It also famously broke down in Mexico and the United States where it blocked Air Force One on one occasion and had to be taxied out of the way.  In 2003, it failed to get off the tarmac at Baldonnel Aerodrome when the then Taoiseach was about to fly to Prague for a meeting and an air taxi had to be hired at short notice at a cost of &euro;36,000.  I wish Journey Aviation the best and wish its customers well.  Deputy Cullinane referred to various fancy paraphernalia.  I wonder if the number of times the Government jet broke down was advertised because we are as well shot of that particular aircraft.  As an aside, I know Donald is selling Air Force One and buying a new one.  Perhaps we may avail of that opportunity at a knock-down price.<\/p><p>To address Vote 36 of the appropriation accounts, there was a slight excess in the outturn for the purchase of military transport.  I note the excess arose due to requirements to purchase additional military vehicles.  I also note that the replacement of heavy armoured cars and troop transporters is planned by the Department.  Before Christmas, I asked the Taoiseach a question on this matter.  Will Mr. Quinn take me through this process because there is disenchantment with the tender competitions run by the Department?  Timoney Technology, an Irish company, is one of the world's leading companies in designing and developing light armoured vehicles, yet it cannot secure a simple engagement with the Department to enable it to illustrate how it could serve our armed forces and the nation.  It is a leading manufacturer and I mention it because we are a small nation and this Irish company is engaged by the Australian military and other military forces elsewhere.  I would appreciate if Mr. Quinn could make a statement on a tender process that would allow for simple engagement to have this company illustrate how it could best serve our nation.  <\/p><p><b>Mr. Maurice Quinn:<\/b>The normal process that we follow in the Department of Defence for procurement is open tender.  That is standard practice.  We are also doing a lot of work on supporting enterprise arising out of the White Paper and decisions that were taken earlier.  There is a whole range of vehicles that we are procuring in the period ahead.  I will come to the Mowags.  There are the armoured logistical vehicles and armoured utility vehicles.  Not to labour the point, but the nature of our overseas deployments is such that where troops are deployed in armoured personnel carriers, the vehicles supporting them also need to be armoured so we are doing a lot of work on that at the moment. <\/p><p>With regard to the upgrade of the 80 armoured personnel carriers we have, which is original equipment provided by Mowag, there was a very long process followed within the organisation to bottom out on what was the most appropriate way of ensuring that armoured capability was available to the Defence Forces into the future.  We had 80 of these vehicles starting back in 2003 I think and the outcome of all of that was that the nature of the work that was required to be done on the vehicles meant that we needed to deal, on a sole source basis, with the original equipment provider.  That was the contract that we awarded shortly before Christmas to GDELS for the work to be done on our armoured personnel carriers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017012600002#P02100","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1485421200,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I mentioned a particular company.

It is recognised as a world leader in the supply of the suspension systems for armoured vehicles.  What I am asking Mr. Quinn is how a company can illustrate and demonstrate to the Department of Defence that it is capable of meeting the criteria set out.  In a previous response to me on this issue the Taoiseach said that there is constant monitoring to ensure the availability of proper equipment for the Defence Forces, that he had discussed the issue of resources with the Department of Defence and that it had been agreed with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that the matter would be carefully examined.  He also said that he hoped the Defence Forces would never be sent out with inadequate or inferior equipment.  That was a hell of a statement by the Taoiseach.  As I said, the company based in Navan in County Meath is supplying hundreds of vehicles to the Australian Army, the US Army and to other armies across the Continent.  I should point out that the Taoiseach later clarified his statement.  Perhaps Mr. Quinn would comment on the willingness of the Department to engage with Irish companies on the process surrounding the purchase of equipment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017012600002#Q00100","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1485421200,"counter":453,"content":"<p>We were aware of the company in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017012600002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1485421200,"counter":454,"content":"<p>It had previously worked with the Department dating back to the 1970s.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017012600002#Q00300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1485421200,"counter":455,"content":"<p>That is correct.

The Department found there were excessive expected costs and the decision was made not to exceed &euro;400,000 and a decision was made to dispose of the aircraft.  Clearly the Irish State was going to have costs associated with storage, but I am not sure Mr. Quinn attributed an approximate cost to this process.  Were any other options available to the Defence Forces to return the aircraft to the Defence Forces?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017012600002#S00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1485421200,"counter":504,"content":"<p>We had contracted with Gulfstream.

Will Mr. Quinn give us the name of the person who gave the informal advice?  Who in the Department made contact with this person who worked in the aviation industry?  What is the name of the company for which the person worked?  Was the person a board member, a CEO or a director?  What level of expertise did this person have?  Mr. Quinn stated e-mails were exchanged with this informal contact and adviser, which underpinned the decision made.  I go back to the earlier exchanges where we had on differences of opinion between the GOC and the person who gave the conflicting advice, which is this informal contact.<\/p> <p>  There seems to be a more fundamental question, and to restate it for Mr. Quinn so he knows exactly and understands exactly what the Comptroller and Auditor General has stated, a cost-benefit analysis is important in the disposal of any asset or equipment.  The Comptroller and Auditor General stated in the case of the Gulfstream jet the Department did not formally appraise the economic case for increased maintenance costs in 2013 or 2014 nor the cost of returning the jet to a serviceable position against the benefits that would accrue from this use.  In response to earlier questions on why the Department did not cost getting the jet back to a workable position and getting it flying again, Mr. Quinn stated a decision had been made by the Minister to sell it.  It strikes me there is a possibility the narrative here is that the exceptional circumstances spoken about by Mr. Quinn are political, whereby a decision was made by a Minister to sell and get rid of the jet and the Department then sought to get whatever information or scrap of paper it possibly could from somebody to justify selling it.  A political decision was made to sell it and get what we could for it.  The Department then sought whatever justification it could from an expert, which is what it got, and it seems the advice previously given by people in the Air Corps was dismissed.  This is something that worries me.  Will Mr. Quinn to respond to this potential narrative?  Will he provide the committee with the specific information I have sought?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017012600002#S01900","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1485421200,"counter":521,"content":"<p>The person is Mr. Nick Fitzpatrick and the company is Atron, with which we have had dealings previously.

In fact, Mr. Quinn is not quite saying \"Sorry\" because the Department disagrees with the Comptroller and Auditor General although it agrees it should have recorded this better.  I appreciate that acknowledgement.

Compare and contrast that with the insurance certificate which was presented here with a flourish.  The cost for that was $5 million, and we will subtract about 5% since the exchange rate is not great right now, so that is about &euro;4.75 million.  I have spoken to people in the aviation industry, and there would be two things in the insurance that would inflate the value of insurance on the certificate to take into account.  One would be the lost profit element to the company and the other would be the slight inflation between the list price received for the aircraft and the insure price to the aircraft.  Much like with insurance on a car there would be a discrepancy there.  It tends to be about 5% as well.

If it is not, it would be good to circulate it here to see Mr. Quinn's rationale as to why he arrived at that decision.<\/p> <p>  I refer to chapter 8, paragraphs 12 and 13, which trouble me a little bit.  Mr. Quinn spoke about having spare equipment in stock for all contingencies and how it is the job of the Army to always be vigilant, plan ahead and plan for unforeseen circumstances.  The essence of paragraphs 12 and 13 is that the Department, and Mr. Quinn, as the Accounting Officer, were of the view that it would have been highly speculative to produce contingency cost projection that may arise for unidentified or unforeseen problems.  Even the boy scouts have a motto, b&iacute; ullamh, be ready.  Mr. Quinn is saying that the Defence Forces were not preparing for unidentified, unforeseen problems.  What kind of an Army would we have if it was not planning for unforeseen developments?  The Department should always have a note in the event of problems.  That jet could have crashed anywhere in the last 22 years.  There should have been a note on the options to consider but Mr. Quinn is saying that there was no point.  The essence of that is there is no point in speculating or drawing up a contingency plan for an event that we are not sure might ever happen.  The essence of the Defence Forces is to be ready and prepared.  A crash or anything could have happened.<\/p><p>I understand that when the issue arose you had to make the best fist of it but not enough advance planning had been done.  The Department was caught on the hop when it happened.  It was always a possibility that some fine day the aircraft would run into a problem.  The Department seemed to have zero contingency planning in place.  I am speaking about the lack of a contingency plan.  To put it simply, if the current aircraft, the Learjet, ran into a problem tomorrow morning I would hope Mr. Quinn had a contingency plan in place and would not be stating that the Department did not get into providing contingencies for unforeseen problems.

The last thing I want to ask about concerns legal costs.  It would not be a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts if we did not hone in on them.  Table 6.5 on page 730 of the Appropriation Account 2015 concerns legal costs.  There were 215 legal cases involving employees and the cost of compensation was &euro;1.783 million.  The legal costs paid by the Department and the costs awarded in that case amounted to &euro;1.475 million giving a total cost of &euro;3.258 million.  The amount paid to employees was &euro;1.783 million and in addition to that, legal costs on top of that came to 83%.  That is very high.  There were 39 claims from members of the public and compensation awarded amounted to &euro;431,000.  The legal costs associated with those awards amounted to &euro;175,000 when the two are added together with the figure being 58%.  Why are legal costs 83% on top of the actual compensation paid when members of the Defence Forces take cases against the Department when they are only 58% when members of the public take cases against the Department?  Does the Department contest cases brought against it by its own employees more vigorously and incur more legal costs than it does when it contests claims brought by members of the public?  Logically, it incurs more legal costs.  Can Mr. Quinn comment on that?  Why does the Department incur more legal costs in cases where it is fighting against Defence Forces personnel compared to, say, traffic accidents involving members of the public?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017012600002#X02100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1485421200,"counter":750,"content":"<p>As the Chairman knows, we do not have any direct control over the amount of time and legal costs.  The Chief State Solicitor and the State Claims Agency agree bills of costs and their tax default agreement if necessary.  My analysis of the situation would be that much of that depends on the nature and complexity of the issue being dealt with.  When the State Claims Agency is dealing with claims by members of the public, these claims are, in general, reasonably straightforward whereas when you go through some of the more intractable cases we have had with employees where there are very specific and difficult points of law and the rights of a particular individual are being dealt, they are more complex, take more time and, therefore, incur more costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017012600002#X02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1485421200,"counter":751,"content":"<p>That is an inadequate answer.  I accept that during the course of the year, you can have one, two, ten or 20 complicated cases but we are talking about over 200 here.  The pattern is that we are looking at nearly 300 cases during the year.  It is not a question of some individual cases being more complicated.  There is a clear pattern of legal costs being higher when the Department is dealing with members of the Defence Forces.  Does the Department contest these cases more?  It brings me to the issue of Baldonnel.  A whistleblower produced a report in 2015 regarding the difficulties members of the Defence Forces had in respect of dealing with hazardous waste and chemicals out there.  Mr. Quinn is aware that the Department is responsible and that according to the Health and Safety Authority, the Defence Forces did not have proper health monitoring for its members and did not provide proper personal protection equipment and adequate staff training.  The Health and Safety Authority had to visit Baldonnel three times last year and issued a report in 2016.  Can Mr. Quinn give us a copy of that report?  I know six of these cases are before the courts.  In light of all that, is Mr. Quinn telling me that the Department is going contest liability?  Surely it should be saying \"hands up, let's settle this and let's get rid of the 83% top-up cost for the legal profession for wheeling the thing in and out court?\"  In how many of these cases does the Department accept liability and avoid the avoidable and unnecessary costs that the State Claims Agency incurs on the Department's behalf?  Many of these costs could be obviated if the Department put its hands up and accepted liability where it is the appropriate thing to do.  Can Mr. Quinn comment on that?  The Health and Safety Authority is telling the Department this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017012600002#X02300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1485421200,"counter":752,"content":"<p>There are three aspects to this.  The first concerns the Health and Safety Authority and the Air Corps.  As the Chairman knows, we have litigation and people who have availed of the protected disclosures legislation so we must be careful in the way we deal with that.  To clarify, the Chairman is correct in that protected disclosures were received in December 2015 and January 2016.  The Health and Safety Authority visited the Air Corps quite soon thereafter.  There was an ongoing conversation between the Air Corps and the Health and Safety Authority, particularly about how hazardous chemicals were being managed.  The final sign off with the Health and Safety Authority was in October 2016.  Quite a comprehensive plan has been signed off on between the Air Corps and the Health and Safety Authority that will be implemented over a number of years so that is all up and running.<\/p> <p>  Where liability is not contested or where there is shared liability, it is our practice with the State Claims Agency that an effort is made to resolve cases as expediently as possible.  However, when it comes to litigation against the State, there is an obligation to ensure the correct treatment of all cases, which is, as the committee knows, to go into a process of establishing loss or damage and its extent along with cause and so forth.

I worry that sometimes a Department might know there is a liability but not want to settle a figure in case the Comptroller and Auditor General says it should not have done so.  Instead, it might decide to let the High Court or the Supreme Court settle the figure.
