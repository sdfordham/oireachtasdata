This included details in relation to proposed measure outlines for inclusion in the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) for the period 2014-2020 as well as an outline of the National Exchequer funding for the new RDP.  The agreement reached on the Multiannual Financial Framework provides for a total allocation of EU funding of &euro;2.19 billion (&euro;313m per annum over 7 years) to Ireland for a new RDP.  Regulation 1305\/2013 on Support for Rural Development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) provides that at least 5% of this allocation must be allocated to projects delivered under the LEADER mechanism.  Following consultation with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, 7% of the available EU allocation (some &euro;153 million) has been allocated to LEADER.  Thus, &euro;2.037 billion of the EU funding is allocated to measures to be delivered via the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. <\/p><p>  The Government has shown its commitment to a strategic investment in Rural Ireland and the agri-food sector by providing matching National Exchequer funding at the rate of 46% to supplement the &euro;2.037 billion EU allocation.  In addition to this money, there is also an allocation of some &euro;170 million from the current RDP to be spent in 2014 and 2015.

These proposed measures have been designed to reflect the priorities for Rural Development set out in the Rural Development Regulation as well as to support the Smart, Green Growth message of Food Harvest 2020.  The proposed measures include a substantial new Agri-Environment and Climate Change Scheme (GLAS), continued support for Less Favoured Areas, significant support for capital investments and knowledge transfers, an innovative new beef data and genomics scheme and a range of other supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100053#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Administration","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100053#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[6340\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100053#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the way the rules as laid down by the European Commission on the leasing of entitlements will operate here, in particular in cases where the owner of the entitlements has not activated any entitlements in the reference year; the reference year that will be applied; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The number of entitlements that will be allocated to a farmer under the new Basic Payment Scheme will be based on the number of eligible hectares the farmer declares in 2013 and 2015, whichever is less.  The value of entitlements that will be allocated to a farmer in 2015 will be based on a percentage of the value held by the farmer in 2014.  As of yet it has not been decided whether the \"value\" will be based on the total value of \"entitlements\" held by a farmer in 2014 or on the value of the \"payments\" received by the farmer in 2014 as these options have differing impacts on the status of leased entitlements. <\/p><p>  If Ireland chooses &quot;entitlements&quot;, then the calculation of 2015 value would be based on the entitlements &quot;definitively held&quot; by each farmer in 2014.  As per the Delegated Act, the value of any entitlements leased out by a farmer in 2014 would be attributed to the lessor.  In this scenario the lessor and lessee may enter into a Private Contract Clause (PCC) whereby the lessor may lease out together with the holding or part of it the corresponding payment entitlements that will be allocated in 2015.  Such PCC would have the effect of recognising an existing lease agreement and would allow both lessor and lessee to benefit.  However, such a transfer requires that the lessor has an &quot;allocation right&quot; based on receiving a direct payment in 2013, or based on any of the other optional measures which would give rise to an &quot;allocation right&quot;, and that the lessee is an active farmer as defined in article 9 of the Direct Payment Regulation. <\/p><p>  The difficulty arises therefore where lessors have leased out their entire holding and all entitlements in 2013 and consequently do not have an automatic &quot;allocation right&quot;.  As a consequence, they will neither be eligible to receive entitlements in their own right, nor can they enter into a PCC to transfer entitlements to the lessee.  The value of such 100% leased entitlements would be lost to both lessor and lessee but would remain in the overall fund for redistribution. <\/p><p>  This issue remains the subject of negotiation with the EU Commission where Ireland continues to argue for increased flexibility in dealing with leased entitlements.  However, if no resolution can be found, the parties involved in the lease may safeguard the value of the leased entitlements by entering into a permanent transfer of the entitlements in question under the 2014 scheme year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100053#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coillte Teoranta Harvesting Rights Sale","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100053#WRA01050"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[6345\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100053#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he no longer plans to sell the harvesting rights of Coillte forests; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>The Government decided on 19 June 2013 that it is not the appropriate time to proceed with the proposed sale of Coillte Harvesting Rights.

This decision was made on the basis of a comprehensive analysis by NewERA, Coillte, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department.  The analysis included, as part of the process, a number of detailed financial, technical and other specialist reports in relation to Coillte, by external specialist consultancy bodies, in full consultation with the Board of Coillte and its executive management.  A number of bodies also outlined their views to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p><p>  It is important to put the consideration about the sale of Coillte harvesting rights into context.  As a Government, it was necessary had to examine all reasonable means to raise revenue, including the release of some of the value from State assets.  Coillte, as a state owned enterprise managing the State's forest estate which represents a significant state asset, formed part of that exercise.  The Government is very much aware of the economic and social benefits of forestry, as is evident by the allocation of funding in 2014 for the forestry programme, and of the important contribution Coillte makes in relation to the supply of timber to the sawmills, in the provision of forest recreational activities and valuable tourism attractions and in the maintenance of the State's forest estate.  I have consistently said that the Government would proceed cautiously on this issue as it was important not to do anything to adversely affect the forest industry and its ongoing development.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the restructuring of Coillte, proposals in relation to restructuring are currently being considered and evaluated by NewERA.  The Government will consider all the options to maximise value from Coillte when the restructuring is complete.  The Government also decided, in June 2013, that a robust analysis be carried out to evaluate how to give effect to a beneficial merger of Coillte with Bord na M&oacute;na to create a streamlined and refocused commercial state company operating in the bio-energy and forestry sectors, as committed to in the Programme for Government.  NewERA is undertaking a financial evaluation on behalf of the relevant Government Departments (my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources), which is currently being finalised.

It is clear that under State Aid rules no aid may be given for the replacement of any lost or damaged fishing boats.  In relation to pots, State Aid rules potentially allow for limited financial assistance for replacement of lost pots, but importantly any such assistance may not increase the ability of a vessel to catch fish.  This is potentially difficult to implement without the risk of breaching State Aid rules.

The total amount involved was &euro;1 million or an average of &euro;100 per annum.  The applicants involved were cases, whose payments were reduced on the basis that it was less than 3% or 2 hectares.  In such cases, provision is made in the EU Regulations that, with the exception of over-claims of 0.1 hectare or less (tolerance), payment is not made of the lands deemed ineligible.  Checks were carried out in each case to ensure that the ineligible area\/feature existed in each of the earlier years.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that there are some positive outcomes of the current Review from a farmer's point of view.  In the first instance I announced last week that the number of payment entitlements, which farmers will be granted under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015 will be based on the 2013 eligible land or in 2015 if it is lower.  This means that farmers, who have ineligible land deducted in 2013 as part of this Review, will be protected under the new Regime as their entitlements will be based on the actual eligible land in 2013.  In addition, it also means that farmers, who are contributing to the convergence process by having reductions applied to their entitlements, will not see part of the funds used to make payments on ineligible lands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100054#WRB00200","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Assist Scheme Eligibility","counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100054#WRB00250"},{"type":"question","counter":37,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[6346\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100054#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his Department was consulted in relation to the changes in the means testing of eligibility for the farm assist scheme in budget 2013 by the Department of Social Protection; his views on the impact the changes have made to farm income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These sharing arrangements have remained in place without change since 1983 reflecting the reality that any increased share for one Member State must be balanced by reductions for another.  Under the Hague Agreement of  Heads of Governments  in 1976, a system of so called &quot;Hague Preferences&quot; was put in place, under which Ireland gets an enhanced share of certain key quotas on which we were traditionally dependant, if the share falls below certain set levels.

The scheme is subject to certain restrictions on operators located in Natura 2000 protected sites and operators in the salmon farming sector.  I have made available some &euro;2 million for this scheme in 2014.  BIM also makes available grants of up to 40% under the Aquaculture Innovation and Technology Scheme for investment in innovative technology and the trialling of such technology under commercial conditions to improve performance and competitiveness and similarly provides grants of up to 40% under the Pilot Aquaculture Scheme for small scale investment projects in aquaculture, which are being implemented on a pilot basis prior to full scale commercial development.  <\/p><p>  My Department is currently preparing a new Operational Programme for the seafood sector for the period 2014-2020 under the proposed EU Regulation for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.  My Department has already conducted a public consultation with stakeholders in 2013 on issues facing the aquaculture sector and investment priorities for aquaculture for the new Programme.  I would anticipate that the new Operational Programme will be completed before the end of this year and that BIM will be providing further supports to the aquaculture sector from 2015 under that Programme.<\/p><p>  Finally, under article 34 of the Regulation on the Common Fisheries Policy (1380\/2013), Member States are required to prepare a National Strategic Plan for Aquaculture by 30 June 2014.  These Plans must include the Member State's strategic objectives for the aquaculture sector within its territory and the measures and the timetables necessary to achieve those objectives.  In 2013, I requested BIM to prepare this National Strategic Plan on behalf of my Department and work is ongoing on this Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100054#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":67,"content":"<p>Question No. 114 answered with Question No. 110.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishery Harbour Centres","counter":68,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100054#WRB02450"},{"type":"question","counter":69,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[6195\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100054#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a decision has been reached on the proposal to introduce paid parking at Howth Harbour, Howth, Dublin 13.","asker":"1020","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":70,"content":"<p>The House will be aware that I have been considering introducing a charge for parking facilities within Howth Fishery Harbour Centre for some time, for the following reasons:<blockquote>- to assist in operating Howth Fishery Harbour Centre on a financially-sound basis,<br \/><br \/>- to provide a source of revenue for further investment in Fishery Harbour Centre facilities,<br \/><br \/>- as part of an overall traffic management plan, and<br \/><br \/>- in order to maximise the return on this significant State asset.<\/blockquote>  There is a broad range of factors to consider in coming to a decision; first and foremost Howth Fishery Harbour Centre is a working fishery harbour, one of 6 Fishery Harbour Centres in the State.

The outlook for the development of the agri-food sector is positive, and I am confident that the industry developed targets set out in Food Harvest 2020 are achievable and can be met.  The third Milestones report of the Food Harvest High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), published in September 2013, showed that the sector had already achieved growth as follows by the end of 2012: 25% in primary production; 20% in value added; and 13% in exports, compared to the Food Harvest baseline period.  The announcement from Bord Bia that agri-food exports reached almost &euro;10 billion in 2013 underlines the contribution of the sector to the national economy.<\/p><p>  Another very positive development was the successful conclusion of CAP reform negotiations during the Irish Presidency of the EU last June.  Last month I announced that, in addition to the &euro;8.5 billion in EU funding that will be paid in direct payments to farmers in the period up to 2020, &euro;1.9 billion in national funding will be added to the &euro;2.2 billion in EU funding already secured for expenditure on rural development.  This brings the total funding for the sector over the period to more than &euro;12.5 billion.<\/p><p>  In view of these positive developments, the average family farm income of around &euro;25,000 according to Teagasc's National Farm Survey in 2012 does appear low.  However, it should be borne in mind that this average includes many farms defined as &quot;part-time&quot; based on their labour input requirement.  Average farm income for &quot;full-time&quot; farms was over &euro;45,000 in 2012.  On half of farms represented by the National Farm Survey, either the farmer or spouse had an off-farm job.  Overall it is estimated that on 78% of farms, either the farmer and\/or spouse had another source of off-farm income, be it from employment, pensions or social assistance.<\/p><p>  With regard to the groceries sector, the Government considers that it is important to strike a fair balance between the various players in the grocery goods sector.

The company is subject to the legislation under which it was established, namely the Forestry Act 1988.

The Afforestation Scheme is a voluntary scheme and is one of a number of land-use options open to landowners.<\/p><p>  The development of the new forestry programme, which will be carried out in parallel with a Strategic Environmental Assessment that will feed into the development of the programme at scheme level, will also examine the level of incentives needed to meet afforestation targets.

Contracts under that value threshold are also advertised as national-level contracts on the e-tenders system.

In my remarks that day, I pointed to the great progress in the totality of relations since the overwhelming approval of the Agreement by referenda in both parts of the island.

The North South Ministerial Council meets on a regular basis across Ministerial areas of responsibility, co-operating in the interests of economic recovery and job creation, North and South.  25 Ministerial level meetings were held in 2013.  Relations between Ireland and Britain are strong and close.  In April this year President Higgins will make a State Visit to Britain at the invitation of Queen Elizabeth, whose own successful visit here in 2011 exemplified the close relations between our two countries.  The visit of President Higgins in April will mark further progress.  Next month the Taoiseach will visit London for his third Annual Summit with Prime Minister Cameron.

Ireland's election observation roster has been put in place to facilitate the deployment at short notice of suitably qualified individuals to participate in international election observation missions, organised in the main by the EU and the OSCE.  The EU and the OSCE set the specific skills requirements for election observation missions and make the final call in selecting observers to participate in individual missions.  Requirements set for participation include relevant language skills, good knowledge and\/or experience of electoral processes, knowledge of human rights and\/or governance issues, and relevant regional experience.  <\/p><p>  Ireland has had very good success in recent years in terms of having nominees selected to participate in missions led by the EU and the OSCE.  In order to ensure this continued success, it was critical that a new election observation roster contained the right mix of skills and experience, matching the specific requirements set by the EU and the OSCE.  Specific, often difficult, language skills are frequently sought by the EU and the OSCE in organizing missions.  The importance of having this as a criterion for inclusion in the new roster is borne out by recent calls to serve on election monitoring missions.  In 2013, for example, Irish roster nominees took part in eleven election monitoring missions overseen by the EU.  Six of those missions required fluency in a primary language other than English.  In the case of the OSCE, while English is the primary language used on missions, knowledge of a second relevant local language is usually indicated as desirable for election observers.  The trend for 2014 so far mirrors the 2013 experience.  <\/p><p>  Given the range of experience and specific skills requested by both the EU and OSCE for participation in election observation missions, I am satisfied that the four criteria selected to assess applications for Ireland's new roster were appropriate and merited equal weighting.  The assessment of applications against these four criteria was carried out in a fair and impartial way.  I am confident that, given the broad mix of skills and experience across our new roster, Ireland will be in a position to maintain our active participation in international election observation missions into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100055#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100055#WRC01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Data","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100055#WRC01450"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[6367\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100055#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"notwithstanding the decision not to make allocations from the local government fund at a municipal district level, if for the purposes of transparency and to further strengthen democracy at a local level, he will provide a breakdown of local property tax revenues on a municipal council level for 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":125,"content":"<p>The Local Property Tax Act 2012, as amended, is based on local authorities within the meaning of the Local Government Act 2001.\u00a0 Accordingly, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that compliance data in relation to the Local Property Tax (LPT) are available broken down by city and county councils nationally and that preliminary figures for 2014 will be published shortly.\u00a0 Any changes having regard to the new Municipal Districts will be considered in due course if considered necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100055#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Exemptions","counter":126,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100055#WRC01650"},{"type":"question","counter":127,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[6547\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100055#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has considered extending the principles of the cycle to work scheme to other activity areas, for example, gym membership, to promote healthier lifestyles among the general population.

This framework is known as the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) which sets set out the steps which lenders must follow:<blockquote>Step 1: Communicate with borrower;<br \/><br \/>Step 2: Gather financial information;<br \/><br \/>Step 3: Assess the borrower's circumstances; and <br \/><br \/>Step 4: Propose a resolution. <\/blockquote>    The CCMA provides an integrated and cohesive package of consumer protection measures and it seeks to deliver on the following principles, to:<blockquote>- ensure appropriate resolution of each borrower's arrears situation;<br \/><br \/>- ensure that lenders deal with borrowers in a fair and transparent manner;<br \/><br \/>- support and facilitate meaningful engagement between lenders and borrowers; and<br \/><br \/>- ensure borrower awareness of the benefits of co-operating with their lender, and the consequences of not co-operating. <\/blockquote>  The Central Bank has advised that, where a borrower believes that his\/her lender has not complied with or in any way disregarded the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, he\/she may make a complaint to the lender.\u00a0 The lender must seek to resolve the borrower's complaint in line with the complaints handling process set out in provisions 10.7 to 10.12 of the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code.\u00a0 If the borrower remains dissatisfied following the outcome from the complaints or appeals process, he\/she may then refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman who deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers.  In addition to the protections provided by the CCMA, under the Central Bank's Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) process, the Central Bank is requiring the main lenders to work through their mortgages in arrears of more than 90 days and, where possible, to propose and conclude sustainable restructures for their borrowers in arrears.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Of course, the CCMA and MART can only work in circumstances where the borrower cooperates with the lender and engages with the process.\u00a0 Where this does not happen, the lender may have no other option but to go down the legal route to deal with an arrears case.\u00a0 However, if that course of action leads the borrower to commence a constructive engagement, this can lead to a more favourable outcome for the respective parties.  The Deputy may wish to note, that according to information collected by my Department, in the case of private dwelling home some 50,000 mortgage accounts in difficulty have been the subject of permanent restructuring following engagement between borrower and lender.\u00a0 A further 23,000 mortgage accounts in difficulty have been the subject of temporary restructures. <\/p><p>  However, even if the MARP process has concluded and a repossession case has commenced in the legal system, the recent Land and Conveyancing (Law Reform) Act 2013 now provides a power to the Court to adjourn a repossession proceeding in relation to a principal private residence to enable the borrower to consult a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP) and, where appropriate, to instruct the PIP to make a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) proposal.\u00a0 In formulating a proposal for a PIA, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 places an onus on a PIP to do so on terms that shall not insofar as reasonably practicable, require the borrower to dispose of an interest or cease to occupy a principal private residence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100055#WRC02600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Rebate Scheme","counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100055#WRC02650"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[6214\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100055#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding a person (details supplied) in County Wexford in respect of the Revenue Commissioners' CG diesel rebate scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This followed an extensive consultation process where over 200 submissions were received from consumers, consumer representative bodies, industry and other representative bodies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that the CCMA provides an integrated and cohesive package of consumer protection measures for borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears.\u00a0 It seeks to deliver on the following principles, to:<blockquote>- ensure appropriate resolution of each borrower's arrears situation;<br \/><br \/>- ensure that lenders deal with borrowers in a fair and transparent manner;<br \/><br \/>- support and facilitate meaningful engagement between lenders and borrowers; and<br \/><br \/>- ensure borrower awareness of the benefits of co-operating with their lender, and the consequences of not co-operating. <\/blockquote>  \u00a0The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that sustainable arrears resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  The CCMA clearly sets out the conditions which lenders must satisfy before legal proceedings for repossession can be commenced. <\/p><p>  Below is an excerpt from the CCMA:<\/p><p>&quot;Where a borrower is in mortgage arrears a lender may only commence legal proceedings for repossession of a borrower's primary residence, where:<blockquote>a) the lender has made every reasonable effort under this Code to agree an alternative arrangement with the borrower or his\/her nominated representative; and<br \/><br \/>b) (i) the period referred to in Provision 45 d) or Provision 47 d), as applicable, has expired; or<br \/><br \/>  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (ii) the borrower has been classified as not co-operating and the lender has issued the notification required in Provision 29.&quot;<\/blockquote>  The CCMA does not limit a lender's discretion to re-engage and\/or review the borrower's case where the borrower's circumstances improve after the lender has commenced legal proceedings.\u00a0 Paragraph 59 of the CCMA also provides that, where legal proceedings have commenced, a lender must continue to maintain contact with the borrower.\u00a0 If an alternative repayment arrangement is agreed between the parties before an order in relation to the repossession of the property is granted, the lender must seek an order from the Court to put the legal proceedings on hold for the period during which the borrower adheres to the terms of the alternative repayment arrangement.<\/p><p>  It is important to point out, however, that even if the MARP process has concluded and a repossession case has commenced in the legal system, the recent Land and Conveyancing (Law Reform) Act 2013 now provides a power to the Court to adjourn a repossession proceeding in relation to a principal private residence to enable the borrower to consult a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP) and, where appropriate, to instruct the PIP to make a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) proposal.\u00a0 In formulating a proposal for a PIA, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 places an onus on a PIP to do so on terms that shall not insofar as reasonably practicable, require the borrower to dispose of an interest or cease to occupy a principal private residence.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The strong view of the Government is that, in respect of co-operating borrowers under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), repossession of a person's primary home should only be considered as a last resort and that every effort should be made to agree a sustainable arrangement as an alternative to repossession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100055#WRC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":154,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100056#WRD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":155,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[6290\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100056#WRD00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will clarify the definition of the &euro;12,700 guaranteed income required in situations where life assurance policies are capitalised and where the maximum immediate capitalisation is sought by the contributor; if such guaranteed income is required to originate from a State pension or private income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Prior to that Act, any person taking a pension from a Defined Contribution (DC) scheme or a Retirement Annuity Contract had no choice but to purchase an annuity with their remaining pension pot after drawing down the permissible tax-free retirement lump sum. <\/p><p>  The choices which then became available included the existing option to purchase an annuity with those remaining funds, and new options to receive the balance of the pension funds in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate), to invest in an ARF or an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), subject to certain conditions. Access to these flexible options was extended to all main benefits from retirement benefit schemes (other than Defined Benefit pension arrangements) in Finance Act 2011. ARFs and AMRFs are therefore investment options into which the proceeds of these pension arrangements can be invested on retirement. It is not clear from the details provided in the question if the life product referred to represents a pension arrangement to which the flexible options would apply.<\/p><p>  Under the regime the options to:<\/p><p>  -invest in an ARF; or<\/p><p>  -receive the balance of the pension fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate)<\/p><p>  \u00a0are subject to conditions. The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed level of pension income (&quot;specified income&quot;) actually in payment for life at the time the option is exercised. The minimum level of specified income currently stands at &euro;12,700 per annum. The purpose of the specified income requirement is to ensure, before an individual has unfettered access to their remaining retirement funds via an ARF or by way of the cash option (subject to tax), that they have the security of an adequate guaranteed pension income throughout the period of their retirement.\u00a0<\/p><p>  \u00a0Specified or guaranteed income means income that an individual is actually in receipt of in his or her own right, at the time the ARF option is exercised, from a pension in payment for the life of the individual (not a pension to which he or she would have an entitlement in the future). Specified income includes the State contributory or non-contributory pension (excluding amounts paid in respect of a dependent spouse or other individual) or an equivalent pension in payment from another State. The income requirement can also be satisfied by private pension income or an annuity in payment for life.Where the minimum specified income test is not met, and an individual does not wish to purchase an annuity, then an AMRF must be chosen into which a &quot;set aside&quot; amount must be invested. The maximum &quot;set aside&quot; amount required to be invested in an AMRF is &euro;63,500 of the pension fund or the remainder of the pension fund after taking the tax-free lump sum if less than &euro;63,500. Any pension fund remaining after the investment of &euro;63,500 in an AMRF may be invested in an ARF. The purpose of an AMRF is to ensure a capital or income &quot;safety net&quot; throughout the latter period of their retirement for individuals with pension income below the specified income limit.\u00a0\u00a0The capital in an AMRF is not available to an individual until he or she reaches 75 years though any income generated by the fund can be drawn down subject to tax. The capital in an AMRF can be used by the owner at any time to purchase a pension annuity and the AMRF can be changed to an ARF with access to the capital sum (subject to taxation) before the age of 75 where the specified income test is met before that age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100056#WRD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100056#WRD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[6295\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100056#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason changes in tax credit and tax cut-off rates have been made in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In line with Revenue's multi-sourcing strategy, it was signalled in the tender that Revenue intended to engage more than one vendor. Following completion of the tendering process, contracts were signed with the above six companies. The notification published in the Official Journal of the EU indicated that the expected value of the combined contracts would be &euro;18-25m per year.

Claimants' legal costs may be paid as part of the settlement of a claim. <\/p><p>  As the SCA has delegated certain personal injury related and third party property claims management functions, it is mandated to ensure that the liability of the State in relation to such claims, and the expenses of the Agency in relation to such management, is contained at the lowest achievable level. In conjunction with the delegated State Authorities, the SCA has a strong track record in reducing the cost of managing claims under its remit. <\/p><p>  The following are some of the more notable methods used to manage and reduce such costs: <\/p><p><b>I.<\/b>\u00a0<b>Solicitors' Fees<\/b><\/p><p>  In 2010\/2011 the SCA invited tenders in respect of the provision of legal services by solicitors' firms in connection with its personal injury (non-clinical), third-party property damage and clinical claims portfolios. Following the tender, the SCA reduced the level of fees paid to its retained solicitors firms by approximately 25 per cent. In addition the SCA imposed caps on the levels of the fees paid to its panel solicitors in respect of catastrophic injury.\u00a0<\/p><p><b>II.<\/b>\u00a0<b>Barristers' Fees<\/b><\/p><p>  In 2012, the SCA announced a new procurement structure requiring barristers to engage in a competitive tendering process under which their fees were capped at up to 25 per cent below pre-procurement levels. This was the first time a State agency had procured barristers services for personal injury litigation in this way. Under the new procurement process, barristers were required to set out their fees - subject to the respective caps specified by the SCA - for a wide range of legal services in respect of personal injury actions in the District, Circuit and High Courts. The new procurement structure also provided for a panel of barristers, to provide services to the SCA, who had less than five years practice\/experience, so they could gain relevant experience in the area of personal injury actions. This was an initiative by the SCA to encourage younger barristers and to create greater competition at the Irish Bar by increasing the pool of barristers available to it. The barristers procurement initiative attracted approximately 1,000 applications.\u00a0<\/p><p><b>III.<\/b>\u00a0<b>Optimal Claims Management and use of the SCA In-House Legal Team<\/b><\/p><p>  The SCA claims management teams endeavour, wherever possible, and in the appropriate cases, to settle claims prior to the issue and service of legal proceedings, thus reducing the State's overall legal costs bill. In addition, a proportion of litigated claims are handled by the SCA's in-house legal team, thereby reducing the outsourcing costs in respect of legal services. In 2012 the in-house legal team was expanded and a separate, dedicated legal team was established to deal with clinical claims. When fully established it is estimated that an annual saving of approximately &euro;4 million may be achieved.  \u00a0<\/p><p><b>IV.<\/b>\u00a0<b>Claimant Legal Costs<\/b><\/p><p>  The level of legal costs paid to plaintiffs' legal representatives is carefully reviewed and, wherever possible and by means of negotiations, the SCA seeks to achieve the maximum possible reduction in legal costs. If the SCA cannot successfully agree the level of legal costs to be paid to plaintiffs' legal representatives, the matter is determined by a Taxing Master.  \u00a0<\/p><p><b>V.<\/b>\u00a0<b>Money Recoveries\/Third-Party Contributions<\/b><\/p><p>  The SCA vigorously pursues all available money recoveries in accordance with best claim practices and as permitted by law. One such example is the recovery of damages and costs by means of third party\/ codefendant contributions. Whether by adjudication of the court or agreement with the third party\/codefendant, a specified percentage contribution in relation to a particular claim may be paid by the third party\/codefendant to the SCA. Additionally, in certain cases, an indemnity in full may be received from a third party\/codefendant.<\/p><p>2.\u00a0\u00a0<b>In tabular form, the firms paid in each year; the amount paid to each firm<\/b><\/p><p><b>Defence legal costs:<\/b><\/p><p>  All legal services engaged by the SCA in the management of claims under its remit are drawn from its panels of barristers and solicitors.\u00a0 The SCA can provide a breakdown of fees paid to individual firms in 2012 and 2013.\u00a0 However the collation of this information will require 2 -3 weeks to compile and ensure accuracy and I will write to the deputy with this information when it becomes available.<\/p><p><b>Claimant legal costs:<\/b><\/p><p>  A breakdown of claimants' legal costs, by individual firm, is much more time consuming due to the volume of firms.

Revenue also works with fuel sector representative bodies, which have been very supportive of the range of measures introduced to combat fuel laundering, to improve the integrity of the distribution system and minimise the risk of fraud. In support of this, I introduced a provision in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that will make a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty at the standard rate of tax.  This new provision will strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying fuel recklessly to dubious customers.<\/p><p>  Revenue has recently published guidelines for mineral oil traders which will assist them in identifying and avoiding such transactions.  Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group and has established regional sub-groups to facilitate traders reporting suspicious matters through their representative associations on a confidential basis.  This information can assist Revenue in closing down the illicit trade by identifying traders supplying fuel to launderers and by identifying outlets that are selling laundered diesel.  Revenue's enforcement strategy in the fuel sector has already yielded significant results.  In the period from mid-2011 to end 2013, 119 filling stations were closed for breaches of licensing conditions.  Since the beginning of 2011, over 2.7 million litres of fuel have been seized and 29 oil laundries detected and closed down, including 9 oil laundries in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100057#WRE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Legislation","counter":231,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100057#WRE01750"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[6728\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100057#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason pension retirement bonds are not allowed by the Revenue Commissioners to qualify for the approved retirement fund; if such bonds resulted from a pension scheme which did not allow the approved retirement fund option; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":233,"content":"<p>By way of background, Approved Retirement Funds (ARFs) were introduced by Finance Act 1999 to provide control, flexibility and choice to holders of personal pensions and to proprietary director members of occupational pension schemes in relation to the drawing down of benefits from their pension plans. Prior to that Act, any person taking a pension from a Defined Contribution (DC) scheme or a Retirement Annuity Contract had no choice but to purchase an annuity with their remaining pension pot after drawing down the permissible tax-free retirement lump sum. The ARF arrangement extended the options at retirement so that, in addition to the annuity option, the balance of a pension fund could be taken in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate) or be invested in an ARF, subject to certain conditions. <\/p><p>  The ARF option was extended, in Finance Act 2000, to the part of an employee's occupational pension fund built up from Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) and most recently, in Finance Act 2011, it was further extended to cover an employee's entire pension fund where the fund is a defined contribution (DC) occupational pension scheme. The 2011 extension which applied with effect from 6 February 2011 (the date of passing of the Act), was in respect of DC schemes approved by the Revenue Commissioners, on or after that date, under Chapter 1 of Part 30 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Where DC occupational pension schemes had been approved by Revenue prior to that date, the legislation (section 19(7)(f) of Finance Act 2011) provided that the extension of the ARF option in such cases was conditional on the scheme rules being amended to allow a scheme member exercise the option. The 2011 Finance Act, did not, however, extend the ARF option to the main scheme benefits of defined benefit (DB) occupational schemes. <\/p><p>  \u00a0I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners, that pension retirement bonds, otherwise known as Buy-out-Bonds (BoBs), are single premium insurance policies effected by the trustees of an occupational pension scheme on behalf of a scheme member, as an alternative to providing a preserved retirement benefit under the scheme for that member. They are used in circumstances where a scheme member is leaving service and opts for a transfer value, on the wind-up of a scheme or where pension splitting arises in the context of a Pension Adjustment Order. BoBs are approved by the Commissioners on a generic, rather than individual, basis in the form of a standard bond policy document, under Chapter 1 of Part 30 of the TCA 1997 as DC products. However, in the view of the Commissioners, BoBs are not occupational pension savings vehicles in the normally accepted sense   for example, an individual with a BoB cannot make contributions to the BoB. Rather, they are a specialist pension vehicle to deal with the specific situations described above. <\/p><p>  \u00a0I am further advised by the Commissioners that it has always been a condition of approval of generic BoB policies that the benefits to be provided to an individual under such policies be subject to the same restrictions and conditions that applied to the occupational pension scheme from which the transfer to the BoB originated. This includes access to the ARF option. The entitlement to the ARF option, in effect, travels with the transfer value paid into the bond and the fact that the BoB is considered a DC pension product does not, of itself, give entitlement to the ARF option from the BoB as of right. Thus, prior to the Finance Act 2011 changes, the ARF option only applied to benefits under a BoB where the bond holder could have availed of the option under the originating occupational pension scheme, e.g. that the bond holder was a proprietary director before leaving service or that part of the originating transfer represented AVCs. There was no alteration in this position following the Finance Act 2011 changes. <\/p><p>  Thus, transfers to BoBs from DB schemes generally, do not have access to the ARF option and transfers from DC schemes that took place either prior to the change in the law in Finance Act 2011 or prior to the required change in the DC scheme rules to permit the ARF option, do not qualify for the option.<\/p><p>  In this regard, the question of ARF access from BoBs was specifically considered, in the context of the National Pensions Framework published by the previous Government, by the Implementation Steering Group tasked with progressing the Framework's proposals in relation to flexible options in retirement. In recommending the extension of the ARF option to DC main scheme benefits, the Implementation Steering Group endorsed the then existing position in relation to BoBs i.e. of linking ARF access to the underlying occupational pension scheme from which the transfer value came. In the context of BoBs originating from DB schemes in particular, endorsement of this restrictive stance reflected broader policy concerns about the possible impact that accessing the ARF option by the  back door  through BoBs might have on DB schemes generally.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the issue of permitting BoB access to the ARF option continues to be raised with my Department and the Revenue Commissioners by representative bodies in the pensions sector.

The Commissioners have confirmed that LPT can only be deducted by DSP from the following payments:<\/p><p>  - State Pension (Contributory and Non-Contributory),<\/p><p>  - Widow\/Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Pension (Contributory and Non-Contributory),<\/p><p>  - State Pension (Transition),<\/p><p>  - One-Parent Family Payment,<\/p><p>  - Invalidity Pension,<\/p><p>  - Carer's Allowance,<\/p><p>  - Disability Allowance and<\/p><p>  - Blind Pension. <\/p><p>  It is not possible to facilitate the deduction of LPT from Jobseeker's benefit payments and the Commissioners understand that there are two particular considerations relating which arose in examining whether to provide a facility for deduction of LPT at source from Jobseekers' Payments.\u00a0 Deduction at source works on the basis that payments are spread evenly over the year.  The intermittent nature of certain DSP payments, including jobseeker's payments, means that such payments do not lend themselves to a weekly deduction at source system.

The Commissioners further advise that a person whose only income is a DSP payment will qualify for a deferral of LPT is they wish.  I am advised that information on deferral of LPT as well as details of other payment methods are available from the Revenue website or by calling the LPT helpline on 1890 200 255.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100057#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Data","counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100057#WRE02550"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[6789\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100057#WRE02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the total provisions taken by AIB, EBS, Bank of Ireland, Irish Bank Resolution Corporation and Permanent TSB in respect of residential and buy to let mortgages in each year from 2010 to 2013.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":245,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[6790\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100057#WRE02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the total write-off of mortgages taken by AIB, EBS, Bank of Ireland, Irish Bank Resolution Corporation and Permanent TSB in respect of residential and buy to let mortgages in each year from 2010 to 2013.

This Statement of Account is not required to contain any statement to the effect that Bus &Eacute;ireann do not make a profit from school transport and the account is completed in all of the respects set out in the agreed document.

On the question of maintenance costs, in a reply to a similar question on 3rd October 2013, I stated that safety is Bus &Eacute;ireann's highest priority and this is reflected in the Company's vehicle maintenance process and procedures. The report of the School Transport Value for Money Review noted, for example, that random checks of maintenance standards and audits of maintenance records including contractors' school buses and their maintenance premises, conducted on behalf of Bus &Eacute;ireann by internationally recognised experts in the field of vehicle maintenance systems and safety standards, are at a higher standard than usual tests. This investment in best practice vehicle maintenance improves the standards of all vehicles that are used to provide services under the School Transport Scheme nationally, and not only those operated directly by Bus &Eacute;ireann. In addition Bus &Eacute;ireann conducts thorough six-weekly preventative maintenance checks incorporating stringent safety inspections on all of its school transport vehicles, as well as other measures that are in addition to and designed to further enhance statutory vehicle safety standard requirements.

This operates at local school level. The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. This approach has been adapted and puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support.<\/p><p>  Since September 2012 guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. In this way principals have discretion to balance guidance needs with the pressures to provide subject choice. My Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. All 195 second-level schools in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1.

This issue spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers. It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally. Schools also engage in a wide range of sport and cultural co-curricular activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth.<\/p><p>  Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle since 2003 and is designed to promote positive mental health. It is supported by comprehensive teacher guidelines and curriculum support services which provide training and advice for schools and a resource directory. The Department has also issued guidelines to schools on the development of whole-school policies in the areas such as anti-bullying, relationship and sexuality education , substance misuse, managing critical incidents, whole-school guidance planning etc. which are also important in promoting positive mental health. <\/p><p>  The National Educational Psychological Service was established in 1999 to support the personal, social and educational development of all children in Primary and Post-Primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice, having particular regard for children with special educational needs. NEPS is structured upon eight regional divisions, with 21 local offices each catering for schools in the immediate locale.  There are currently 178 psychologists employed within the service with two further basic grade psychologists due to be recruited in the next few months to the NEPS Clondalkin office.  <\/p><p>  NEPS psychologists can support the mental health and well-being of students and teachers at all levels of the school system. The NEPS service provides direct and indirect support to individual students through consultation and casework.  The service also provides systems level support to schools which aims to be preventative and developmental and promotes a continuum of support approach for students' with learning, social, emotional or behavioural difficulties. This approach is outlined in publications for primary and post-primary schools - A Continuum of Support Guidelines for Primary Schools (2007) and A Continuum of Support Guidelines for Post-Primary Schools (2010) which include resource packs. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that I launched the Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention in January 2013 which were developed by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.  The Well-Being Guidelines provide practical guidance to post-primary schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.  The Guidelines have been developed to bring coherence to and build upon the multitude of practices that are already in place in schools to promote well-being. They emphasise the need to use a coordinated whole-school approach in the promotion of positive mental health. This involves building and integrating school self-evaluation processes, implementing the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, developing the whole-school guidance plan, adopting the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support, and building effective inter-agency relationships. <\/p><p> Support for implementation of the guidelines will be integrated into existing CPD work plans of the DES support services.  The Guidelines highlight the fact that school personnel are the best placed professionals to support and work sensitively with students. The NEPS psychologist, can support school staff, in particular guidance counsellors, in the identification of students with mental health difficulties and can advise schools on the development of policies related to student well-being and on issues such as bullying.  Copies of the Guidelines have been circulated to schools authorities.<\/p><p>  Student support is promoted in schools through year head and key tutor systems, home\/school links, etc. This is one of the key areas which is evaluated by the Inspectorate as part of a Whole School Evaluation. Psychologists support the student support team and NEPS has produced a booklet in the past month, Student Support Teams in Post-Primary Schools. This provides advice to schools on reviewing or establishing   student support teams.  NEPS psychologists will be actively engaging with schools in regard to this guidance in the course of the current academic year.   <\/p><p>An important role for NEPS psychologists is the provision of support and advice to schools in relation to managing critical incidents that affect the school community. Each school in the country has been provided with an information pack on responding to critical incidents.  NEPS psychologists have also guided many schools in the development of a Critical Incident Management Plan, which enables and empowers schools to respond effectively to a critical incident.  <\/p><p>  NEPS has implemented the Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management programme with whole staffs or with groups of primary school teachers. This evidence-based programme provides training for social-emotional interventions for children of primary school age. NEPS is also currently providing teacher support in implementing the Friends for Life programme. This programme uses a cognitive-behavioural approach to managing anxiety and has both primary and post-primary components.  NEPS liaises with HSE professionals such as the primary care teams and child and adolescent mental health teams to ensure that pupils with significant mental health difficulties are identified and referred to those teams for support.<\/p><p>  In addition I had published, along with my colleague, Minister Fitzgerald, an Action Plan on Bullying. This plan sets out twelve actions to help prevent and tackle bullying in primary and second level schools.  The National Educational Welfare Board, as part of the newly formed Child and Family agency has no role, per se, in the support of guidance counselling in schools.<\/p><p>All publications mentioned are available on the DES website. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100058#WRF02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":283,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 189 and 190 answered with Question No. 186.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Personal Insolvency Act","counter":284,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100058#WRF02150"},{"type":"question","counter":285,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[6281\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100058#WRF02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he is concerned that the omission of third level education fees as part of standard living expenses in a personal insolvency arrangement by the Insolvency Service of Ireland could act as a barrier for access to third level education if a person's income eligibility is above that required to obtain a student grant; if his Department is monitoring this situation and if it has provided any input on the matter to the Department of Justice and Equality, which is responsible for the personal insolvency legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Such supports include:Youth Encounter Projects, established in the 1970s as non-residential facilities for children at risk of coming into conflict with authority or are at serious risk of dropping out of mainstream school. There are five YEPS, three in Dublin and one each in Limerick and Cork, providing 120 places for children. The current overall enrolment is 107. YEPs receive a pay and non-pay allocation of &euro;1.124 million to cover the employment of all ancillary staff and to cover school running costs. Permanent teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) in the school are paid through the Primary and SNA Payroll system at an overall cost of &euro;1.85million. <\/p><p>City Motor Sports, Swift Alleys, Francis Street, Dublin 8, provides education and training for young people aged between 15 and 18 years. It was established in 1995 as City Motor Sports in the south west inner city as a response to widespread joyriding in the locality. The current enrolment is 14. My Department funds the cost of 51 teaching hours per week at a total cost of &euro;90,375 in 2012 and provides a non-pay grant of &euro;113,479 to City of Dublin ETB to meet running costs.<\/p><p>  The Carline Project is located in a purpose built centre, in Lucan, Co Dublin. It caters for young people aged 14 to 17 years. The current enrolment is 22. My Department funds the cost of 71 teaching hours per week at a total cost of &euro;141,787 in 2012 and provides a non-pay grant of &euro;170,000 to County Dublin and Dun Laoghaire ETB to meet running costs.  Life Centres are informal education centres established by the Christian Brothers in 1996, with the assistance of the Holy Faith Sisters, as a response to the needs of young people who have dropped out of mainstream education. There are two Life Centres in Dublin and Cork which receive a grant of &euro;114,000 towards running costs and 2,768 teaching hours under the ETB co-operation hours scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;233,000. <\/p><p>  Matt Talbot Adolescent Service Centre in Co Cork provides residential drug and alcohol treatment for 14-18 year old boys. It provides educational courses at Junior and Leaving Certificate Level, ECDL and FETAC Levels 3 and 4. My Department provides &euro;190,000, through Cork ETB, towards the cost of instruction staff at the centre <\/p><p>  In addition my Department funds the Youthreach programme which provides two years integrated education, training and work experience for unemployed early school leavers with incomplete qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age. There are almost 6,000 places available nationwide under the Youthreach. Almost 3,700 of these places are provided by ETBs in just over 100 Youthreach centres. Expenditure in the region of &euro;68 million was provided for this service in 2012. The majority of the remainder of places are provided by F&Aacute;S in Community Training Centres which also provides two years integrated education, training and work experience incorporating basic skills training, practical work training and general education with the application of new technology integrated into all aspects of programme content. The overall cost for this service in 2012 amounted to some &euro;43.3million. <\/p><p>  A small portion of the overall funding in Youthreach includes provision for under 16's.

","asker":"1101","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":423,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 237 and 238 together.<\/p><p>  At the outset, I might clarify that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Act, 2001 and the making of valuations for rating purposes is his sole prerogative. The statute does not accord me, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, any function in this regard.<\/p><p>  The Valuation Act, 2001 provides for the exemption from rates of land that is developed for sport such as playing pitches, land on golf courses, tennis courts, etc. In relation to the valuation of buildings occupied by a club affiliated to a sporting organisation, the position is that the 2001 Act also provides for the exemption from rates of &quot;Community Halls&quot;. To be classified as a Community Hall, the premises needs to be used for purposes which are not for profit or gain and involve participation by inhabitants of the locality generally and are used for purposes which are of a recreational or otherwise of a social nature. Many sports clubs\/organisations achieve exemption from rates of their property under this provision. However, the Valuation Act, 2001 specifically excludes from this provision, the premises of a club registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904. Therefore, the premises of such a registered club are rateable, which essentially means that clubs licensed to sell alcohol are rateable.\u00a0 This provision has the effect of making the entire premises occupied by the club rateable and not just that part of the premises normally used for the sale of alcohol. The premises of a club are not rateable after it ceases to be registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904. <\/p><p>  The sale of alcohol is a commercial activity and a licensed sports club is competing with other commercial licensed premises, all of which are rateable.\u00a0 Therefore, in equity, exemption from rates can only be achieved by the cessation of the club's registration under the 1904 Act. <\/p><p>  Regarding the measures to address issues in relation to the valuation of sports grounds and buildings, the statutory mechanism available to the Commissioner and, which is used to maintain the existing valuation lists on which the local authority rates are based, is known as Revision of Valuation. \u00a0The Revision procedures, set out in Part 6 of the Valuation Act 2001, are used to add new properties to the list, to amend the valuation of altered properties and to remove demolished or defunct properties from the list. The valuations of non-domestic properties, including those occupied by sports clubs, are determined by reference to the values of similar type of properties in the same local authority area to ensure, in so far as it is possible, that they are all treated in a fair and equitable manner. <\/p><p>  In relation to individual cases, the well-established statutory revision process conducted by the Valuation Office includes an extensive appeal system which in the first instance, provides that where a ratepayer, if he or she considers that the proposed valuation of a premises or any details contained in a Proposed Valuation Certificate are incorrect, can make representations to the Valuation Manager for a review.<\/p><p>  The &quot;representations&quot; to the Valuation Office must be made within 28 days of the date of issue of the said Certificate and, if taking this course, an occupier must provide clear reasons and supporting evidence to justify any proposed changes, including an alternative valuation. The result of the review following representations will be notified to the occupier of the premises by way of a final Certificate of Valuation. The occupier has a right to appeal their valuation to the Commissioner of Valuation and, if still dissatisfied following the Commissioner's decision, may subsequently appeal to the Valuation Tribunal. It is an independent body set up for the purpose of settling disputed valuations between the Commissioner of Valuation and the ratepayers or local authorities.\u00a0 There is also a further appeal available to the Higher Courts but only on a point of law. <\/p><p>  With regard to the payment of commercial rates by sporting organisations, the position is that, under Irish law, there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation multiplied by the annual rate of valuation (ARV).\u00a0 As already mentioned, the valuation of commercial properties for rating purposes, including the valuation of property occupied by sporting organisations, is the responsibility of the Valuation Office which has no function in the collection of rates. This\u00a0is the responsibility of individual local authorities. Therefore the Valuation Office would not be in a position to furnish details of the rates paid by sporting organisations on a nationwide basis. These\u00a0\u00a0details would be a matter for the local authorities concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100061#WRJ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Works Scheme Funding","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100061#WRJ01250"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[6396\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100061#WRJ01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will make emergency funding available for coastal protection works in the vicinity of Callinafercy Pier, Milltown, County Kerry, as the recent storms and high tides did an alarming amount of damage in this area; if he will come to the assistance of this community and take into consideration that this is now a high-risk area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

At present further technical discussions based on this political agreement are taking place between both sides.  These technical discussions are necessary in order to finalise the legal text of the agreement. Once agreement is reached on these, the agreement will proceed for translation and for legal validation.  It is anticipated that the agreement will enter into force towards the end of 2015 or in early 216.<\/p><p>  The CETA covers virtually every aspect of economic activity, and is an extremely important one for Ireland. It is the first comprehensive trade agreement with an historically close trade and economic partner and is a landmark deal between our two transatlantic economies.  When fully implemented 99% of all tariffs (duties) on goods will be removed, the vast majority of them being wiped away from the first day of implementation.  It is important to note also that the existence of a Free Trade Agreement would not have any impact on the VAT treatment of imported goods.<\/p><p>  The CETA will also widely liberalise trade in services, among others in the areas of financial services, telecommunications, energy and transport.  For the first time ever, all Canadian levels of government will open up their public procurement markets above certain thresholds to European suppliers.  The opportunities presented by the Agreement could add well over &euro;200 million to Ireland&rsquo;s current &euro;2.7 billion bilateral trade with Canada, thus creating more jobs and contributing to our economic recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100062#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Business Regulation","counter":477,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100062#WRK01650"},{"type":"question","counter":478,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[6292\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100062#WRK01700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if there are any plans to make ticket touting illegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":479,"content":"<p>Ticket touting, or the resale of tickets for high-demand entertainment or sporting events at a price above their face value, is not a new phenomenon.  The forms that it takes have changed markedly in recent years, however, due in particular to the emergence of online trading platforms.  These changes have to be taken into account in considering whether or how to make ticket resale illegal.<\/p><p>  First, a high proportion of ticket resales appear to be made by individuals who have bought a small number of tickets legitimately and then proceed to resell them.  A study undertaken in the UK estimates that up to 90 cent of ticket resales are accounted for by resales by private sellers.  It is open to question if criminalising the activities of such individuals would represent an appropriate or proportionate policy response, or would constitute an effective use of the limited enforcement resources available for consumer protection.  Consumer protection legislation currently governs only transactions between businesses and consumers, and extending its scope to transactions between consumers would have major policy and resource implications.<\/p><p>  Secondly, there are now a number of businesses that engage in ticket resale openly and, as they would see it, legitimately.  The main ticketing service provider in Ireland, TicketMaster, operates a UK-based online resale platform, Get Me In, on which tickets for events in Ireland, the UK and the rest of Europe can be purchased.  Secondary ticket sellers such as these contend that they serve a legitimate function in making tickets available to consumers who are willing to pay premium prices for tickets and that they do so in an above-board and transparent manner that complies with consumer protection legislation and avoids the illegality and misselling associated with black-market forms of ticket touting.<\/p><p>  While I would not entirely rule out legislative intervention, I consider that the primary responsibility for preventing the re-sale of tickets at a price higher than their face value rests with ticketing service providers and event promoters. The terms and conditions governing ticket sales generally stipulate that unlawful resale is grounds for seizure or cancellation of the ticket. I note in this connection that the English Rugby Football Union successfully took legal action against a ticket resale website in 2012 to force it to disclose the identities of those offering tickets for resale with a view to preventing the sale of tickets to international matches at a price above their face value.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100062#WRK01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises Supports","counter":480,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100062#WRK01850"},{"type":"question","counter":481,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[6234\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100062#WRK01900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will consider supporting a small and medium enterprise (details supplied) in Dublin 15; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":482,"content":"<p>Anyone interested in starting or expanding their own business should in the first instance contact their local County and City Enterprise Board (CEB).

They are the first port of call in terms of advice, direction, training and grant support for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business.  Contact details for the CEBs are available on .<\/p><p>  The CEBs generally only grant assist enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector, which over time can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland portfolio. Retail enterprises are ineligible for direct financial support from the CEBs due to concerns over displacement (where grant-assisted projects simply displace business from other players in the local market).  However, any business can use the CEBs as a gateway to accessing finance from Micro Finance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.<\/p><p>  The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal.  Applications for the Microfinance Fund should be channelled through the local CEB.  In addition, locally trading businesses, including start-ups can avail of non-financial assistance from their CEB in the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives etc.  Training courses include such topics as internet marketing, ideas generation and negotiation skills. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the system for delivery of State supports to micro and small enterprises is being reformed and that the 35 existing County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) will be dissolved and new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) will be created.

The survey is conducted on an annual basis and aggregated at county level.  I am informed by IDA Ireland that these figures are only available for the 10 year series 2004 to 2013.  I am also informed that the 10 year series can change on a year by year basis reflecting the movement in the IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland portfolio of companies.  Details of the number of new jobs created, on a county by county basis, in IDA Ireland supported companies in each of the 10 years from 2004 to 2013 is set out in the attached tabular statement A.<\/p><p>  The cost per job sustained (CPJS) is the measure used by IDA Ireland to assess the cost effectiveness of various IDA Ireland grant programmes.  It is not broken down on a county by county basis.  The figure is calculated by taking into account all IDA Ireland expenditure to all firms in the period of calculation.  Only jobs created during and sustained to the end of each seven-year period are credited in the calculations.<\/p><p>  The latest figures for the cost per jobs sustained are contained in the Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey 2012 and are set out in the following tabular statement B.  The cost per job sustained reduced in the period 2002-2008 arising from the strong employment performance of the FDI sector over the period.  The slight increase in the CPJ over the period 2009-2010 primarily related to the reduced performance of the FDI sector particularly in 2009 where the economy experienced a significant number of job losses.  This was heavily influenced by the global economic and financial environment.  I am glad to be able to point out to the Deputy that this figure has begun to fall again due to improved economic performance in the FDI sector.  The figure for each seven-year period is calculated by dividing the total number of jobs created by the total amount of money spent.<\/p><p><b>Table A<\/b><\/p><p><b>The following table outlines on a

In these circumstances, it is unclear as to the purpose to be served either by an extrapolation of costs based on estimates in the EU Commission documentation which accompanied its original proposals, which differ significantly from those which emerged from the process of negotiation, or of referral to the Oireachtas Committee on EU Affairs on the basis indicated.  Obviously, it is open to the Committee in question to examine such matters within its purview as it considers appropriate.<\/p><p>  It is difficult to envisage that graduate or other recruitment to the audit profession will be adversely affected by these audit proposals, in particular as enhanced audit provisions are entailed.  The differing points of view regarding these audit proposals are moot at this point, as are positions adopted in other non-EU jurisdictions, in a situation where the focus required is on making the necessary arrangements to give effect to the EU measures when enacted. In this connection, the Department will be consulting with all of the stakeholders shortly after the adoption by the EU of the instruments in question.<\/p><p>  The UK Competition Commission in October 2013, having confirmed that competition is restricted as regards the supply of audit services to large companies there, published measures to open up the UK market to greater competition.  One of these is a requirement that FTSE 350 companies must put their statutory audit engagement out to tender at least every ten years.  This is consistent with the provisions of Article 33 of the draft Audit Regulation relating to the duration of the audit engagement.  Officials of my Department appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on 16 October and 18 December 2012 for the purpose of its scrutiny of these EU audit proposals.<\/p><p>  Arising from the scrutiny process, the Joint Committee wrote to the EU Commission and the EU Parliament in the matter on 15 March 2013, remitting its report and a political contribution on the audit proposals, stating that the Joint Committee &ldquo;Concludes that reform of the audit sector is necessary in the context of the recent past and therefore welcomes, in broad terms, the Commission&rsquo;s proposals&rdquo;.

The Tribunal is one of the front-line services directly affected by the current turbulence in the labour market. The Tribunal hears claims under 18 separate pieces of legislation, some of which are lodged as direct claims to the Tribunal and others which come to the Tribunal by way of appeal or implementation of a Rights Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation\/decision.<\/p><p>  I am informed that the waiting periods for a hearing at the Tribunal at the end of January 2014 ranged from 42 weeks to 103 weeks, with an average waiting time outside Dublin of 74 weeks and within Dublin of 71 weeks. These figures are an improvement on the end January 2013 outturns of 81 and 77 weeks respectively. I have attached a table showing waiting times as at January 2014.<\/p><p>  However, these figures should be viewed in context. The Tribunal conducts hearings in about 29 locations around the country and from time to time cases are heard in counties other than the county where the employer is based. Where also, the number of cases is relatively small, the Tribunal may wait until a sufficient number of cases is on hand to make a visit worthwhile. In such areas, 5 days of hearings may reduce the &ldquo;waiting time&rdquo; in the area concerned by 30 to 40 weeks.  As such the waiting times fluctuate on an ongoing basis. I understand that the Tribunal targets those areas with the longest waiting period and highest level of claims outstanding, within the resources it has currently available. Some counties no longer have hearing venues. For example Kildare , Louth and Wicklow cases are now heard in Dublin.<\/p><p>  The Tribunal has been pro-active in driving efficiencies. Divisions of the Tribunal are sitting longer, hearing more cases per hearing and seeking to manage the caseload to maximise efficiency. As part of the drive for efficiencies, the Tribunal streams cases that are envisaged to be more straight-forward.<table><tr><th>Counties<\/th><th>Cases awaiting a hearing date<\/th><th>No of weeks<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>New = 48<br \/><br \/>Resumed =1<\/td><td>81<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>New = 274<br \/><br \/>Resumed =2<\/td><td>76<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>New = 46<br \/><br \/>Resumed =1<\/td><td>72<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>New = 25<br \/><br \/>Resumed =1<\/td><td>43<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>New = 80<br \/><br \/>Resumed =2<\/td><td>81<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>New = 1051<br \/><br \/>Resumed =16<\/td><td>71<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>New = 197<br \/><br \/>Resumed =4<\/td><td>95<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>New = 99<br \/><br \/>Resumed =1<\/td><td>60<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>New = 31<br \/><br \/>Resumed =0<\/td><td>69<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>New = 94<br \/><br \/>Resumed =4<\/td><td>102<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>New = 13<br \/><br \/>Resumed =3<\/td><td>42<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>New = 72<br \/><br \/>Resumed =0<\/td><td>67<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>New = 242<br \/><br \/>Resumed =6<\/td><td>96<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td>New = 13<br \/><br \/>Resumed =1<\/td><td>58<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>New = 35<br \/><br \/>Resumed =0<\/td><td>98<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>New = 102<br \/><br \/>Resumed =1<\/td><td>64<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>New = 22<br \/><br \/>Resumed =0<\/td><td>60<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>New = 74<br \/><br \/>Resumed =2<\/td><td>95<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td>New = 48<br \/><br \/>Resumed =0<\/td><td>82<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td>New = 12<br \/><br \/>Resumed =0<\/td><td>67<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>New = 46<br \/><br \/>Resumed =0<\/td><td>82<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>New = 123<br \/><br \/>Resumed =1<\/td><td>80<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>New = 108<br \/><br \/>Resumed =0<\/td><td>103<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>New = 45<br \/><br \/>Resumed =0<\/td><td>45<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>New = 39<br \/><br \/>Resumed =2<\/td><td>45<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>New = 136<br \/><br \/>Resumed =0<\/td><td>98<\/td><\/tr><\/table>Overall Dublin waiting period: = 71 weeks (approximately)<\/p><p>Overall County average waiting period: = 74 weeks (approximately)<\/p><p>The approximate waiting period as at 31 January 2014<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100063#WRL00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Development","counter":509,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100063#WRL00350"},{"type":"question","counter":510,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[6772\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100063#WRL00400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of IDA Ireland site visits to County Carlow in the past three years; and his views on whether it is satisfactory to meet the needs of the county.

","asker":"1064","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":529,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 277, 298, 310 and 322 together.<\/p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is the lead Department for severe weather emergencies and the Office of Public Works has responsibility for capital flood relief activities.  However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as the recent severe weather conditions under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA).<\/p><p>  Under the SWA scheme, the Department can make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.<\/p><p>  In addition to the payment of ENPs, SWA legislation also provides for assistance in the form of an urgent needs payment (UNP) which can be made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA.  The person may be required to pay the money back in respect of a UNP at a later date, for example, if the person had significant capital or income or was later compensated by an insurance company.<\/p><p>  A humanitarian assistance scheme was approved by Government in November 2009.  The scheme, which is means tested, is available to assist people whose homes are damaged by flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair. Levels of payment under the scheme depend on the relative severity of damage experienced and the household&rsquo;s ability to meet these costs ensuring that the funding is appropriately targeted.  Humanitarian assistance does not cover risks that are covered by insurance policies or cover business or commercial losses.<\/p><p>  In dealing with events of this nature the DSP generally adopts a three stage approach as follows:<\/p><p>  -Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments for food, clothing, personal items and temporary accommodation in the immediate aftermath of the event.  A relatively small amount of financial assistance is generally provided initially but this will increase as the extent of the problems become clearer. <\/p><p>  -Stage 2 generally involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items. It is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become known.<\/p><p>  - Stage 3 is to identify what longer term financial support or works are required. It could take several months before this stage of response commences and this involves a cross Departmental\/Agency response.  Work carried out can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring, painting etc.<\/p><p>  The income test for humanitarian assistance is fair and the means assessment is more generous than that applied under the SWA scheme in general. For example, a family consisting of a couple and two children with a gross household income of &euro;70,000 or less will receive 100% of the amount allowable in respect of their application.  For each whole &euro;1,000 of household income above the &euro;70,000 the couple will be required to make a personal contribution of 1% toward the amount allowable. The amount allowable in any particular case refers to the amount the officer administering the scheme determines is required to replace essential losses and to make any essential repairs. Further detail on the humanitarian assistance scheme and the income test for single persons and families is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at .<\/p><p>  Guidelines have been provided to officers responsible for administering the humanitarian assistance scheme as to what type of goods and appliances are generally covered by the scheme and what replacement value should typically be attributable to each item, as set out in the tabular statement below.  This list is not exhaustive and is intended as a guide only.<\/p><p>  Any person who is experiencing hardship as a result of the recent weather events, including those in the Foynes area of Limerick, should contact the Department&rsquo;s local representative administering SWA who may be able to offer assistance.<\/p><p>Tabular Statement - Humanitarian Assistance Essential Goods Guideline<table><tr><th>Household Item<\/th><th>Recommended Amount Payable<\/th><th>Household Item<\/th><th>Recommended Amount Payable<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Kitchen<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>Miscellaneous Items<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cooker: Electric<\/td><td> &euro;310<\/td><td>Cutlery Set <\/td><td> &euro;25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cooker: Gas<\/td><td> &euro;310<\/td><td>Crockery Set 4\/Crockery Set 6<\/td><td> &euro;25\/&euro;35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fridge: Single<\/td><td> &euro;140<\/td><td>Electric Iron<\/td><td> &euro;25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fridge\/Freezer<\/td><td> &euro;250<\/td><td>Electric Kettle<\/td><td> &euro;25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kitchen Chair<\/td><td> &euro;40<\/td><td>Frying Pan<\/td><td> &euro;13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kitchen Table<\/td><td> &euro;120<\/td><td>Ironing Board <\/td><td> &euro;20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Microwave<\/td><td> &euro;80<\/td><td>Mop and Handle<\/td><td> &euro;15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Table &amp;amp;

The extension of the participating panel to experts beyond accountants was examined as part of the review and the report recommended that while at present there appears to be no problem regarding supply, the extension of the panel can be considered in the context of the establishment by the Central Bank of an authorisation and regulatory framework for debt management firms under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013. This will ensure that the service for borrowers is of a high quality, is regulated and has a redress mechanism.<\/p><p>  A stakeholder seminar which was attended by representatives of the Phoenix Project was held in January 2014 to discuss the recommendations of the review.  An implementation plan has been prepared and discussions have commenced with the relevant stakeholders to progress the recommendations including the extension of the participating panel to other experts. It is envisaged that the service will continue to be funded by the lenders<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100063#WRL03200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":552,"content":"<p>Question No. 286 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Application Numbers","counter":554,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100064#WRM00150"},{"type":"question","counter":555,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[6299\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100064#WRM00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons who are in receipt of carer's allowance that are not immediate family members; her plans to have those in receipt of the allowance Garda vetted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1184","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":556,"content":"<p>Carers&rsquo; benefit and carers&rsquo; allowance are income supports not commercial considerations, payable to people who provide full-time care.

You will be aware that defined benefit pension schemes in Ireland are set up and maintained by employers on a voluntary basis. There has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to contribute to their pension scheme (although schemes rules can place some level of obligation). Most defined benefit pension schemes in Ireland were established under a trust deed. As part of the process of establishing each occupational pension scheme, an employer undertakes to be bound by the rules of the scheme and to undertake certain liabilities and duties defined therein. The position regarding the employers and employees contribution obligation in a trust deed varies from deed to deed. <\/p><p>  Employers have, by and large, made great efforts to support and deliver on the promise made to scheme members. This process is generally managed through dialogue between trustees, employers and members, where efforts are made to reach agreement regarding the steps that must be taken to secure scheme viability. This may include a mix of measures such as increased employer\/member contributions, longer working and amended benefits. <\/p><p>  Given the uncertainties as to the overall impact and potential for unintended consequences of applying an obligation on an employer to secure a minimum level of scheme funding in the event of the wind up of a scheme, it was not considered appropriate to make provision for such a legislative obligation.  While some countries with very large defined benefit markets provide pension protection schemes it was considered that such an approach was not appropriate in the Irish context. <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013, provides that, in the event of the wind up of an underfunded pension scheme where the employer is insolvent, the State guarantees that existing pension benefits will be protected to a level of 50%, with pensions of &euro;12,000 or less being 100% protected.  The Pension Board is actively engaged with the schemes which do not meet the scheme funding requirement in order to assist these schemes, particularly schemes in a weak funding position, achieve a more sustainable funding position.  The overriding priority in this area is to ensure that pensioners and members of pension schemes are protected and the future viability and sustainability of their schemes is ensured and made safer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100064#WRM02700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Non-Contributory) Eligibility","counter":590,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100064#WRM02750"},{"type":"question","counter":591,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[6432\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100064#WRM02800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if there is a review currently taking place of State non-contributory pension applicants who have capital; if there is an age limit on the applicants being reviewed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":592,"content":"<p>State pension non-contributory (SPNC) is a means tested payment.

Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in relation to protecting people from poverty. To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments. <\/p><p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen each year with the number of eligible customers also increasing significantly.  In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%.

Both I and my colleague, Minister of State McGinley, have also taken the opportunity of attending other cross-border cultural functions.  This has included my attendance at the recent Belfast F&eacute;ile, the William Kennedy Piping Festival in Armagh, the Ulster Museum Commemoration lecture and an event on the Ulster Covenant, the launch of Buntings' Ancient Irish Music in the Linenhall Library, an event at Teac Mallon Creative Arts Centre, an event in the Ulster Hall to celebrate the twinning of Downpatrick and Listowel and the launch of Gaeilge Gan Str&oacute; in 2012.

Realising the potential of this abundant resource will allow Ireland to increase indigenous energy production, thereby reducing our dependence on expensive fossil fuel imports and improving our security of supply, while also contributing to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and creating jobs in the green economy.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), that, based on a number of sources such as the work of the European Environment Agency, and ongoing work at national level, Ireland possesses, on 2020 timescale, around 5% of the total EU onshore wind energy resource that at this point could be technically exploited. All wind energy development is subject to planning consents, which includes environmental assessment. <\/p><p>  Looking beyond 2020, Ireland is estimated to have around 45% of the offshore wind energy resource within the EU. However the level of this offshore resource that could be utilised will be dependent on a number of factors including environmental sustainability, the development of market demand for mature fixed wind technology, and the development of floating wind technology, currently at the research stage.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on a number of websites, including ComReg&rsquo;s website at  as well as the websites of individual commercial operators.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in County Cork. This will be achieved by providing:<blockquote>  -  a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<br \/><br \/>  -  a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/blockquote>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In the fixed line segment of the market, Eircom has announced plans to pass some 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively. Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings. I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in Glanmire, County Cork before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss this further with the Deputy.<\/p><p>  These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. <\/p><p>  The ESB Electronic Communications Bill, which I introduced last month, is a further step in promoting investment in competitively priced high speed broadband. The Bill will, when enacted, enable the ESB to utilise its electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services in the Irish market. <\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work continues in my Department in relation to a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100067#WRP01700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Speeds","counter":717,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100067#WRP01750"},{"type":"question","counter":718,"qnumday":349,"qnumall":"[6407\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100067#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the legislation that has been introduced to set a minimum standard for broadband speed access; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":719,"content":"<p>The delivery of specific broadband speeds to end users is dependent on a number of variables including the equipment used by the consumer, distance from the consumer to the access point in the network, core network traffic and the capacity of the server being accessed in the case of the internet. <\/p><p>  Speed may also be affected by the use of a wireless router or &ldquo;wifi&rdquo; in the consumer premises. Almost all of these factors are beyond the control of the service provider.<\/p><p>  In addition, broadband speeds in the marketplace are currently evolving rapidly, and are likely to continue to do so in the future, as new technologies and enhancements arise. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to include a provision in primary legislation providing for penalties for non-delivery of advertised speeds. <\/p><p>  I understand that ComReg has taken a number of proactive initiatives to address consumer concerns with respect to speeds including working closely with the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland and providing enhanced information on this matter on its website.<\/p><p>  I am also advised that ComReg has recently secured industry agreement to participate in a pilot project to measure and report on broadband speeds measured at the point of access to the premises. This would measure speeds prior to any of the variables I outlined above occurring within a customer&rsquo;s premises. I understand ComReg plans to launch this<b><\/b>  pilot in Quarter 2 of this year and I look forward to the outcome of this pilot. <\/p><p>  I share the concerns that I know many of my colleagues have about advertised speeds versus those that are experienced by consumers. I note however that much of the current significant investment being made by commercial operators involves emphasis on fibre and fibre-powered connectivity. I am confident that these fibre-based investments, together with the State-led investment planned under the National Broadband Plan will significantly enhance the overall level of service quality for customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100067#WRP01900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Fisheries Stocks","counter":720,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100067#WRP01950"},{"type":"question","counter":721,"qnumday":350,"qnumall":"[6436\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100067#WRP02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"further to this Deputy's various recent questions and in view of the recent positive reports from Inland Fisheries Ireland, which has agreed that eel stocks in the Suir and Barrow rivers could sustain a commercial harvest (details supplied), if he will now reconsider the eel ban in the Waterford-New Ross district; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These measures are being delivered and include a minimum price for alcohol and a number of new restrictions on how alcohol is advertised, and particularly how it is advertised to children and young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100067#WRP03500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategy Statements","counter":744,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100067#WRP03550"},{"type":"question","counter":745,"qnumday":358,"qnumall":"[6787\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100067#WRP03600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when the national bioenergy strategy will be published; the steps both his and other relevant Departments are currently taking to ensure its success; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"975","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":746,"content":"<p>My Department is currently finalising a Bioenergy Strategy, with a view publishing it as soon as possible.

Approval was also given for the provision of funding to the local authorities to cover the cost of accommodating HAP recipients, and it was agreed that the Department of Social Protection (DSP) would provide for the implementation of the mandatory direct deduction of rental contributions from the welfare payments of HAP recipients and local authority tenants. My Department and DSP continue to work closely on the legal, policy and operational issues involved in developing and introducing HAP. On 17 December 2013, the General Scheme of a Housing Bill providing for HAP was approved by Government and the Bill is in preparation, as a priority for enactment to facilitate the implementation of HAP in 2014. <\/p><p>  My Department is working closely with all the key stakeholders in overseeing plans for the implementation of HAP, but more specifically at this stage in relation to initiating a pilot project early in 2014 and phased roll out of the scheme later in 2014, subject to the enactment of the relevant legislation. Limerick City and County Councils have been identified as the lead authority to drive implementation in the local government sector including the delivery of the HAP pilot in Quarter 1 2014.   <\/p><p>It is intended that the pilot and implementation phases will prioritise, as much as possible, the transfer of long-term unemployed rent supplement recipients, or those who are homeless or in danger of homelessness, to HAP. This is a reasonable approach to implementation, which will allow any issues that arise to be dealt with in a graduated way and give local authorities sufficient time to scale up the operation of HAP within their housing sections. <\/p><p>  With a view to analysing the specific dynamics of homelessness, in February 2013 I published the Government's <i>Homelessness Policy Statement<\/i> which included a set of indicators which will be used to demonstrate these dynamics. These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland and, in quantifying its on-going extent, will support the bringing forward of realistic and practical solutions. The Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS), which is now operational nationwide will assist housing authorities to report on these indicators and 2014 will be the first year for which PASS will produce composite national data on homelessness. <\/p><p>  In relation to the availability of accommodation in the private rented sector , my Department understands that some local authorities in the Greater Dublin region are experiencing difficulties in sourcing accommodation for households transferring over from rent supplement to the Rental Accommodation Scheme . This is only to be expected as local authorities have to compete with others in the private market. That said , my Department is not aware of difficulties in securing suitable accommodation elsewhere under the scheme.   While there is, therefore, some evidence emerging of a lack of supply in the private rented sector in certain areas, the national picture is mixed. The most recent rent index from the ESRI (for the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) ) showed that rents in the Dublin region had increased by 2.5% over the previous quarter while rents in the 'outside Dublin' category showed a 1.4% increase. These trends in rents suggest that there is a supply issue presenting, notably in the cities. Coupled with the ESRI figures, there is some evidence of a growing pressure on rents in the lower segment of the market with a Threshold study indicating that 50% of people in receipt of rent supplement are making 'top-up' payments to landlords. In the context of the implementation of HAP and housing policy decisions generally my Department will continue to monitor trends in the housing market and the potential impacts on housing supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100068#WRQ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Funding","counter":790,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100068#WRQ03050"},{"type":"question","counter":791,"qnumday":373,"qnumall":"[6364\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100068#WRQ03100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the projected costs for the establishment of Irish Water; if he will use the borrowing provisions of the Water Services Act 2013 to repay the full establishment costs of Irish Water into the local government fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (BGE) had responsibility for most of the deliverables under the Government water sector reform implementation strategy. BGE developed a detailed programme initiation document within the framework of this strategy, which outlined all of the tasks required to establish a fully functioning integrated public water utility and provided this to my Department in August 2012. They also provided an associated budget to my Department which outlined the costs involved in each area of activity, totalling &euro;150m, plus &euro;30m contingency, and reflecting both the use of BGE and external resources. The budget reflected the range of tasks to be undertaken from financial, governance, regulatory business capability, systems, brand management and customer engagement perspectives. In addition, Irish Water has progressed the domestic water metering programme, the full cost of which is &euro;539m excluding VAT. <\/p><p>  All costs incurred by Irish Water in 2013 were financed by a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), with the exception of a grant of &euro;0.57m for a pilot metering study funded by the Department. No other Exchequer funds or voted Department expenditure was provided to Irish Water in 2013. <\/p><p>The establishment costs will be included in the overall funding model for Irish Water; accordingly, they will also be examined by the Commission for Energy Regulation as an integral element of the independent economic regulation of Irish Water. I also expect that establishment costs and metering costs will be included in the regulatory asset base for Irish Water.   <\/p><p>  In 2014, Irish Water, which now has statutory responsibility for water services, will receive &euro;240m in equity from the Minister for Finance and almost &euro;490m from the Local Government Fund but no other funding from the Department&rsquo;s Vote. It is anticipated that Irish Water will finance other costs from borrowing and this will be the subject of appropriate Ministerial consents in due course.

These expenditures were previously met by local authorities from their own resources and general purpose grants from the Fund. <\/p><p>  The level of State subvention to Irish Water from the Fund in 2014 reflects the fact that the costs of operating water services now have to be met by Irish Water and that there will not be revenue from domestic water charges in 2014, as first bills will not issue until 2015. Therefore there is no question of double payment by either local authorities or local communities for water services in 2014. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100068#WRQ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":794,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100068#WRQ03350"},{"type":"question","counter":795,"qnumday":375,"qnumall":"[6366\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100068#WRQ03400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 108 of 6 November 2013, if it is his intention to reduce the proposed retention of local property tax receipts to below 80% to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":796,"content":"<p>The local government funding model has changed considerably in 2014. For example, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing. In addition, under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012   , the Minister for Finance, from 2014 onwards, is to pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this will contribute to a range of financial supports being provided to local authorities, including General Purpose Grants and funding, on the basis of Service Level Agreements, for water services which local authorities will be providing on behalf of Irish Water. <\/p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised. Given the significant changes to local government financing already taking place in 2014, as already outlined, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015.

I expect to be in a position to formulate future policy approaches and actions, taking account of the consultation process, in the near future.<\/p><p>  In 2013, I asked the Housing Agency to conduct a stand-alone review of the shared ownership scheme, including identification of the main difficulties and recommendations for mitigating measures.  While I have received an initial draft of the review from the Agency a number of issues have been identified that need further detailed financial analysis in order to fully assess the impact on local authority finances of possible mitigating measures. This data collection exercise has been initiated and will inform future actions.<\/p><p>  Pending full conclusion of this review, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities in December 2013 setting out some of the options and interim actions that might be explored to alleviate the difficulties of those in shared ownership distress such as allowing use of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and room rental for Shared Ownership mortgage holders.  It is accepted that these proposals are not a complete solution to the issues that arise for such mortgage holders but are intended as an interim measure pending outcome of the review.<\/p><p>  The mortgage arrears resolution process, already in place in respect of commercial mortgages, is now being implemented across all local authorities.  In cases of acute mortgage distress, homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now also in place to deal with personal insolvency.  I fully recognise that shared ownership home owners are, in many cases , impacted by the downturn in the same way as other home owners, for example in consequence of unemployment and possible negative equity.  In such cases borrowers should actively engage with their lenders, whether a commercial financial institution or a local authority, to seek to avail of one of the options available to provide sustainable solutions to distressed mortgages. <\/p><p>  On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears, the Government launched a Mortgage to Rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012.

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme.   <\/p><p>  The water meter installation programme began in August 2013, and will be implemented nationally as quickly as possible.  Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that each water meter has a low power radio unit fixed to the top which enables it to be read periodically from a passing van. This is what is known as Automatic Meter Reading (AMR).  The meters used by Irish Water do not currently employ smart metering technology . However, the meters are capable of being integrated into a smart meter reading system, should that ever be required.<\/p><p>  Irish Water has procured meters and radio units that comply with all relevant European and International Standards designed to protect the health and safety of customers and the public.

","asker":"1181","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":942,"content":"<p>I have considered these reports and recommendations.  The position is that the Reception &amp;amp; Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the administration of the system of Direct Provision accommodation. Currently, there are 4,365 asylum seekers being accommodated in 34 accommodation centres throughout the State under contract to RIA.<\/p><p>  The operation of the Direct Provision system is kept under constant review and I have consistently acknowledged that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed.  I have no desire to have applicants remain in the protection system any longer than the minimum period it takes to process their case. The direct provision system is not ideal but it is a system which facilitates the State providing a roof over the head of those seeking asylum or seeking other grounds to be allowed, on humanitarian grounds, to stay in the State. It allows the State to do it in a manner that facilitates resources being used economically in circumstances where the State is under financial difficulty. <\/p><p>  No Government can afford to ignore the likely consequences of any change to the Direct Provision system. The system cannot exist solely in its own context. It is inextricably linked to the surrounding international protection process. By its very nature, the processing of applications for international protection is a solemn and complex task which does not always lend itself to achieving speedy outcomes. The overall length of time taken to process asylum application cases to their finality is determined not just by the length of time taken to process the cases by the independent refugee determination bodies and by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) but also by the time needed to determine the outcome of any legal proceedings taken by the applicant during that process. A substantial proportion of cases in the High Court relate to judicial review proceedings taken or decisions reached in the international protection area.<\/p><p>  My resolve therefore is to deal with the factors which lead to delays in the processing of cases so that asylum seekers spend as little time as is necessary in that accommodation system. To that end, the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I will re-publish later this year, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion.  I have also recently signed into law new Regulations relating to the processing of subsidiary protection applications. Once the new arrangements have bedded down, the aim is for subsidiary protection applications currently on hand to be processed to finality by the statutory bodies concerned in the shortest possible time frame consistent with quality and fair assessment of all cases and of course, subject to the cooperation of applicants and no further legal impediments arising. <\/p><p>  In those circumstances it is anticipated that very significant inroads can be made on the caseload by the end of 2014.<\/p><p>  In relation to children in the Direct Provision system, I have recounted in detail to the Oireachtas on numerous occasions the ways in which RIA affords the highest priority to the safeguarding and protection of children. These include the full implementation of the Children First Guidelines as well Garda vetting of all RIA centre staff.  RIA has a fully staffed Child and Family Services Unit, the head of which is seconded from the HSE.  Moreover, details of the types of facilities and supports available to children are provided on RIA's Annual Report for 2012 which can be found on the website at www.ria.gov.ie.

Section 6 of the 1993 Act provides that a court may (on application or otherwise) make a compensation order against a person convicted of an offence instead of or in addition to dealing with the offender in any other way, unless it sees reason to the contrary.  <\/p><p>  From time to time, issues can arise with sentences imposed in cases where financial compensation offered to the victim by the offender is regarded as a mitigating factor by the court when sentencing the offender.  This, I believe, is particularly inappropriate in cases involving serious offences, where the requirement to impose an appropriate penalty for the crime should not be confused with the court&rsquo;s power to separately award compensation to the victim for personal injury or loss.<\/p><p>  Last week, the Government approved the drafting of the Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill and the publication of the General Scheme of the Bill. The proposed legislation will replace the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 with modern provisions dealing with community sanctions and the role of the Probation Service in the criminal justice system. <\/p><p>  It is my intention to break the link between the payment of compensation and the sentencing of offenders in criminal proceedings.  For that reason, it is proposed that the Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill will amend section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 to disconnect the payment of compensation from the sentencing of the offender.  The amendment will provide that a compensation order can only be made in addition to any other sanction, and not instead of a sanction.<\/p><p>  The making of a compensation order under the Criminal Justice Act 1993 is not a determining factor for the purposes of inclusion of an offender in the &quot;sex offenders' register&quot;.  <\/p><p>  Section 7 of the Sex Offenders Act 2001 provides that a person convicted of a scheduled sexual offence is subject to the notification requirements (&quot;sex offenders' register&quot;) in the Act. Therefore, a conviction (as opposed to a term of imprisonment) is the prerequisite for inclusion on the register. <\/p><p>  The period for which a convicted sex offender is subject to the notification requirements in the 2001 Act depends on the length and type of sentence imposed by the court. In the case of adults, the minimum period for which an offender is subject to the notification requirements is 5 years. This is the mandatory notification period where a sex offender receives a sentence, the whole of which is suspended, or where the sentence is otherwise than one of imprisonment. If a term of imprisonment is imposed, the period for which a sex offender is subject to the notification requirements increases to at least 7 years.<\/p><p>  The statutory notification periods are halved where the offender is under the age of 18 years at the time of sentencing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100072#WRU03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission Issues","counter":966,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100072#WRU03400"},{"type":"question","counter":967,"qnumday":444,"qnumall":"[6469\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100072#WRU03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the changes he propose to introduce to the legislation establishing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This proposition has been broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee. Such an approach can take account of current Government policy while incorporating the many technical and other amendments anticipated. It also provides an opportunity to address the key policy issues including those referred to by the Deputy. Work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis, including in cooperation with the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General while also taking account of any relevant rulings by the Courts and any further submissions received. I therefore expect that work on the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which remains part of the Government's Legislation Programme, will be advanced to enable the publication of a new and enhanced version of the Bill later this year. <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100072#WRU04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Applications","counter":973,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100072#WRU04100"},{"type":"question","counter":974,"qnumday":447,"qnumall":"[6521\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100072#WRU04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress made to date in determination of an application for asylum in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Meath; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":975,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, if the person whose details were supplied has made an application for asylum or subsidiary protection, the position is that it is not the practice to comment on such applications for so long as they are in the protection process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100072#WRU04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport Data","counter":976,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100072#WRU04400"},{"type":"question","counter":977,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[6530\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100072#WRU04500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of additional marked and unmarked Garda cars and vans that were allocated to the Garda R and J districts in 2013; the number of marked and unmarked Garda cars and vans that were withdrawn from these districts in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"997","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1080,"content":"<p>Aggregate cattle supplies at Department-approved meat plants to the end of January 2014 are up almost 10% on the corresponding period in 2012 with strong increases recorded in the steer, heifer and cull cow categories. This higher throughput has led to factories giving preference to certain types of stock that are better suited to the requirements of their retail customers. Prices for prime steers and heifers have remained relatively stable but the young bull trade is challenging at present as age and weight issues continue to affect demand. However, I note that the young bull kill has increased by 50% between week 1 and week 5 of 2014. The Irish beef industry is hugely dependent on exports and the need to ensure that it is producing efficiently for overseas markets cannot be ignored.<\/p><p>  One of the main difficulties in marketing young bulls over 16 months at age is that these animals are outside the specifications preferred by the UK market. This is a major disadvantage at present because the UK market has effectively become the highest-priced beef market in the EU.<\/p><p>  Delays in young bull slaughtering undoubtedly put pressure on producer profit margins but neither I nor any Agriculture Minister can interfere in a trade that is cyclical in nature and prone to short-term price fluctuations. I am, of course, entirely sympathetic to those farmers facing difficulties in getting their cattle slaughtered but cattle prices are determined by the interplay of supply and demand and I have no function in relation to commercial transactions between the meat factories and their suppliers. <\/p><p>  It is the responsibility of the industry &ndash; in this instance, processors and farmers working together &ndash; to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market so that the supply chain operates for the benefit of both parties and does not undermine the viability of bull beef production systems for either winter finishers or suckler farmers. I understand that producer and meat processor representatives have recently engaged in dialogue with a view to resolving the short-term oversupply of young bulls. I would encourage the various bodies to continue their discussions.<\/p><p>  With regard to beef imports, CSO data shows that total volume inflows for the period January to November 2013 amounted to 27,000t compared to 42,000t in 2012 and 47,000t in 2011. Most beef imports are sourced from the UK either in prepared form or, more commonly, in carcase form for further processing. The fresh beef market in Ireland is almost entirely of domestic origin. As a small nation with an open economy producing six times more beef than is required for domestic consumption, and operating within a single market, it is clearly in Ireland&rsquo;s best interests to facilitate international trade.<\/p><p>  In relation to Pillar II measures, my Department recently published a consultation document outlining proposed measures for inclusion in the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) and comments from interested stakeholders are invited. Under the proposed new RDP for the period 2014&ndash;2020, a broad range of support measures for suckler farmers is under consideration including a Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP). This programme has a proposed budget of up to &euro;52m per annum and participating framers would receive &euro;80 for each eligible calf. It should also be noted that suckler framers would likely be some of the main beneficiaries under other schemes proposed for the RDP including the Agri-Environment and Climate Change Measure, Areas of Natural Constraints (formerly Less Favoured Areas), on-farm capital investment measures. <\/p><p>  The draft programme is now available on my Department&rsquo;s website and written submissions are being sought by the 19   February 2014. This consultation process is a key step in designing a draft RDP for submission to the EU Commission for its approval.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100074#WRW03300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Inspections","counter":1081,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100074#WRW03350"},{"type":"question","counter":1082,"qnumday":483,"qnumall":"[6231\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100074#WRW03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps he will take to ensure fairness and transparency in the on-farm inspection regime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) has found that Irish dairy production has the joint lowest carbon footprint in the EU.  The footprint of Irish beef is also below the EU average.  The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has also found that the temperate grassland production system, which is the predominant system of production in Ireland, is one of the most efficient in the world.<\/p><p>  My Department is aware of the need to identify cost effective abatement options that can reduce carbon emissions while at the same time improving farm profitability.  We are now preparing the agriculture sectoral roadmap under the Heads of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill published in early 2013.  The sectoral roadmap for agriculture will take into account the targets in the industry's Food Harvest 2020 strategy as well as the existing mitigation commitments.  However, it is important that the roadmap will also outline a longer term view and will seek to balance the objectives of allowing the food industry to grow so as to meet the food security challenges that face the world; as well as the need to meet future climate change ambition.  <\/p><p>  The recently published Environmental Analysis Report on Food Harvest 2020 has found that the adoption and use of high technology and best production methodologies at farm production level will yield the best environmental outcomes and result in the most effective mitigation measures.  The preparation of the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) for the period 2014-2020 is being informed by the findings and recommendations in this report, and will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas. <\/p><p>  I have recently published a consultation document outlining a range of measures proposed for inclusion in the new RDP.  The measures have been designed to support the Smart Green Growth message of Food Harvest 2020 and thus will encompass the themes of technology, efficiency and sustainability referenced by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  The main elements of the consultation document in terms of proposed measures are:<\/p><p>  - a substantial new agri-environment\/climate scheme (GLAS), which will build on the progress made under REPS and AEOS.  The Scheme aims to deliver overarching benefits in terms of the rural environment and address issues of climate change mitigation, water quality and the preservation of habitats and species.<\/p><p>  - incentives for on-farm capital investment, which will incorporate support for investments with clear sustainability benefits. <\/p><p>  - knowledge transfer and innovation measures including support for the European Innovation Partnership.  These knowledge transfer measures are aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions.<\/p><p>  - a new beef data and genomic technology measure worth up to &euro;52 million per year.  This scheme will have a range of benefits in terms of sustainability, profitability, animal health and welfare, quality assurance, and herd quality,<\/p><p>  - other supports aimed at collaborative farming, artisan producers and organic farming.<\/p><p>  These measures are currently the subject of a public consultation process which is open to written submissions by 19 February.<\/p><p>  Genomic technology, in which we are a world leader, uses DNA finger printing to increase the efficiency of animal breeding programmes by identifying high performance at a very early stage.  The application of this technology on a national scale through my investment in this programme aims to secure this technology's adoption in the National Suckler herd similar to its widespread adoption in the National Dairy herd.  It supports efficiency gains which deliver benefits directly to the farmer in terms of output and financial return as well as to the environment as we improve our efficiency of production systems. <\/p><p>  This type of smart investment will ensure that we remain as efficient as possible in our production systems. Irish agriculture has already achieved significant progress in production efficiency including the use of fertiliser and manure, grassland management, improved breeding and better fertility.  Essential ongoing research into new technologies is being undertaken to maintain our economic and environmental competitive advantages.  The level of emissions from agriculture has been steadily decreasing in recent years and my Department will continue to work with state and industry stakeholders so as seek even greater future efficiencies in a sustainable Irish agriculture sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100075#WRX01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Young Farmers Scheme","counter":1112,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100075#WRX01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1113,"qnumday":493,"qnumall":"[6386\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100075#WRX01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will clarify the ceiling for off-farm income to an applicant for young farmers entitlements who is under 40 years of age and has a green certificate from agricultural college.

My Department and Bord Bia remain fully committed to facilitating this trade so that producers can secure the best possible returns for Irish beef and live exports. <\/p><p>  However, the potential to grow the live trade to Britain is constrained by the labelling systems operated by the retail multiples that are the main outlet for high-quality Irish beef products in the British markets, the interaction of overlapping labelling rules relating to the mandatory labelling system for all beef marketed in the EU, and the eligibility requirements governing the UK food quality assurance scheme known as the Red Tractor.<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Harmonised EU rules require mandatory traceability and origin labelling for beef from slaughterhouse to point of sale to consumers with the objective of providing maximum transparency for the marketing of beef.  Compulsory beef labelling requires food business operators to label fresh, frozen or minced beef with specific information <\/font>to enable the product to be traced back to the animals from which it was derived and must include details of the slaughterhouse and de-boning hall in which the animal was processed as well as the country in which it was born and reared.<\/p><p>  The mandatory labelling rules prevent final retailers from describing any beef products derived from animals born in Ireland but exported live for finishing and processing in Britain as either British or Irish.  Labelling of such product has to state the country of birth as Ireland, the country of rearing as Ireland and the country of slaughter as the United Kingdom.  As the Irish-born \/ UK-finished proposition is regarded as difficult to communicate to consumers and likely to cause unnecessary labelling complications, retailers prefer to market British and Irish beef separately as part of their product mix.  This effectively means as a matter of policy UK retailers prefer beef to be sourced from animals originating in one country only.<\/p><p>  In addition, logistical difficulties arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant.  These carcasses have to be deboned in a separate batch, packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor.<\/p><p>  Bord Bia actively supports the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity.

Prices for prime steers and heifers have remained relatively stable but the young bull trade is challenging at present as age and weight issues continue to affect demand. <\/p><p>  Aggregate cattle supplies at Department-approved meat plants to the end of January 2014 are up almost 10% on the corresponding period in 2012 with strong increases recorded in the steer, heifer and cull cow categories.  This higher throughput is partly a result of cattle becoming fit for slaughter earlier than in previous years leading to a situation whereby factories are giving preference to certain types of stock that are better suited to the trade specifications demanded by their retail customers.<\/p><p>  Cattle prices are determined by the dynamics of supply and demand in the marketplace and I have no function in relation to commercial transactions between the meat factories and their suppliers.  Rather, it is the responsibility of the industry &ndash; in this instance, processors and farmers working together &ndash; to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market such that the supply chain operates for the benefit of both parties and does not undermine the viability of bull beef production systems for either winter finishers or suckler farmers.  I understand that producer and meat processor representatives have recently engaged in discussions with a view to resolving the short-term oversupply of young bulls.  An industry-led solution to clear the backlog of bull beef is essential to restoring confidence in the sector and will hopefully resolve the current difficulties for farmers.<\/p><p>  I fully recognise the importance of maintaining confidence in a sector that has benefitted from historically high price levels in recent years.  Earlier this week, I announced the operational details of an investment package worth up to &euro;40m to beef farmers in 2014.  This package will include a &euro;23m for Beef Genomics Scheme, &euro;10m for the Beef Data Programme, &euro;5m for the Beef Technology Adoption Programme and &euro;2m in residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. <\/p><p>  The Genomic Scheme is a particularly important innovation that it utilises cutting-edge science developed by the Teagasc research facility at Moorepark in collaboration with the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF).  The use of genomics in dairy animals has helped transform cattle breeding in that sector as well as delivering tangible gains for efficient farmers.  Introducing this technology for the suckler sector will help to improve the genetic quality of the national beef herd and to increase productivity and profitability at farm level.<\/p><p>  The scheme will provide a payment of &euro;40 per calf to participants in return for genotyping a selection of their animals specified by ICBF.  Genomic selection involves taking an animal's DNA sample and sending it to a laboratory to assess its performance traits.  Farmers can use this information predicting the genetic merit of their stock to inform their breeding and selection decisions.  Application forms for the scheme will issue to farmers over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  The Government's investment is a strong vote of confidence in the suckler beef sector.  It exemplifies the smart, green growth initiatives envisioned in the 2020 strategy and, coupled with additional support measures under the new Rural Development Programme, will underpin the development of a sustainable beef sector with long-term growth potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100075#WRX02900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":1131,"qnumday":499,"qnumall":"[6473\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100075#WRX03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the actions he has taken to close the very large and unacceptable beef price gap between Irish cattle prices and cattle prices in our largest export market, Great Britain, which is now in the order of 80 cent per kilogram or more than &euro;300 per animal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Furthermore, successive reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy have involved a shift to more market-oriented policies that move away from price supports and towards direct payments to farmers.  <\/p><p>  The UK is approximately 80% self sufficient in its beef requirements and is, by a significant margin, the main market of Irish beef accounting for around 50% of exports in volume terms.  Trade with the UK is impacted by fluctuations in the euro\/sterling exchange rate and the extent of Britain's import requirement which is forecast to increase in the short run consequent on a continuing decline in domestic beef production.  The strong UK cattle prices reflect a fundamentally tight supply situation.  The total number of prime cattle slaughtered at UK abattoirs during 2013 fell 2% on the year to 1.93 million head leaving the UK prime cattle kill for the whole year at its lowest point since at least 1970 when records began.  However, with the UK cattle herd at its lowest point since 1948, it is likely that these slaughter levels are the lowest in approximately 65 years. <\/p><p>  A number of factors have also been identified to account for the differential between Irish and UK cattle prices.  These include a British consumer preference for indigenous beef product.  In any analysis of comparative prices, it must also be recognised that UK cattle prices are currently among the highest in the EU.  Moreover, a price differential makes Irish beef products competitive in the UK market such that Ireland supplies the bulk of the UK's import demand notwithstanding additional logistical and processing costs incurred in shipping to that market. <\/p><p>  It is correct to say that Irish beef exports into the UK tend to command a lower value per kilogram than domestic British beef but it is equally true that the prices achieved there would be well ahead of equivalent beef prices across most of the Continental EU markets where finished cattle prices are much lower.  For example, Irish cattle prices remained ahead of EU levels in 2013 averaging around 106% of EU R3 male cattle prices.  It is expected that the Irish beef sector will be well placed to maintain this momentum in 2014 despite some further increase in supplies. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100075#WRX03100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Payments","counter":1133,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100075#WRX03150"},{"type":"question","counter":1134,"qnumday":500,"qnumall":"[6474\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100075#WRX03200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will negotiate with the EU Commission on behalf of farmers to ensure that thousands of Irish farmers are not unfairly burdened with payment clawbacks and penalties on land eligibility as far back as 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

If an applicant over-declared his or her land by including ineligible features or ineligible areas in the application form, the provisions of the Regulations must be respected in relation to the processing of each application and in the calculation of deductions and penalties.<\/p><p>  I would also like to make it clear that each year my Department forwards maps, Terms and Conditions and covering explanatory letters to all applicants.  In all of the documentation forwarded, it is made very clear to farmers that they should not claim on any ineligible land or features such as houses, buildings, farmyards, lakes, bogs or scrub etc.  As the Deputy will be well aware, the vast majority of farmers adhere to the requirements and ensure that the area declared is all eligible for payment.<\/p><p>  I am, of course, fully aware of the impact of the deductions made in individual cases.  In that regard I implemented a comprehensive review and appeals process to ensure that the cases of individual farmers are fully scrutinised.  In the first instance, a farmer, who finds himself or herself in this position, can seek a review of the original decision by Department officials.  If they are not happy with the outcome of the review, they can submit an appeal to the independent LPIS Appeals Committee, chaired by Mr. Padraig Gibbons.  In addition, I have put in place a process where an on-the-spot verification can be undertaken by one of my Department's officials to assist farmers with land eligibility issues. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100075#WRX03300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Imports","counter":1136,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100075#WRX03350"},{"type":"question","counter":1137,"qnumday":501,"qnumall":"[6476\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100075#WRX03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he ask the EU Commission if, during the past five years, it has undertaken laboratory tests on Brazilian beef and US beef imports into the EU for the presence of any hormones, anabolic steroids, ractopamine or products or substances deemed illegal in the European Union; if he will provide results and details of these tests; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1160,"content":"<p>The bovine Tuberculosis (TB) eradication programme, implemented by my Department, includes a wildlife strategy which involves the removal of badgers when an epidemiological investigation carried out by the Department&rsquo;s Veterinary Inspectorate concludes that badgers are implicated in a serious outbreak of TB in cattle. This policy was introduced in light of research conducted over the years by the Department and others which demonstrated that the eradication of Bovine TB is not a practicable proposition until the issue of the reservoir of infection in badgers, which is seeding infection into the cattle population, is addressed.<\/p><p>  Approximately 6,000 badgers are removed under the wildlife programme annually under licence issued by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Badgers are captured by trained Farm Relief Service contractors, monitored and supervised by DAFM staff, particularly as regards animal welfare aspects.<\/p><p>  There has been a very significant improvement in the TB situation in recent years and, in particular, since 2008: the number of reactors has declined by almost 50% from around 30,000 in 2008 to 15,600 last year<font color=\"#004080\">, <\/font>which represented a 15 % reduction on 2012 levels.<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font> This is a new record low since the commencement of the eradication programme in the 1950s and, for the first time since the programme was introduced in the 1950&rsquo;s, eradication is now a practicable proposition. While it is difficult to quantify the precise impact of badger culling on the reduction in the incidence of TB in Ireland over the past 10 years or so, my Department believes that much of the improvement is in fact due to the badger removal programme. In this regard, it is noteworthy that a recent peer-reviewed study, <i>Bovine tuberculosis trends in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, 1995&ndash;2010 (Abernethy et al., 2013),<\/i> published in the Veterinary Record, found that, during the period studied, the animal incidence of TB increased by 380% in England, by 190% in Wales and by 74% in Northern Ireland. On the other hand, the animal incidence in Ireland fell by 32% in the same period (and by a further 20% since the study). Significantly, the removal of badgers is not practised in England, Wales or Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>  My Department invests in extensive research in relation to badger ecology and vaccination programmes with the intention of developing a vaccination programme, with a view to replacing badger culling with vaccination when this is a practicable proposition. In this context, my Department has been collaborating for some years with the Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis (CVERA) in UCD and with DEFRA in the United Kingdom on research into a vaccine to control tuberculosis in badgers and to break the link of infection to cattle.  Field trials are also being undertaken in several counties at present, involving the vaccination of several hundred badgers over 3 to 4 years, with continuous monitoring of the population to assess the impact of the vaccine on the incidence of disease in the vaccinated and non-vaccinated control badger populations. Success in the field trials is designed to eventually lead to implementation of a vaccination strategy as part of the national TB control programme. As it will be some years before the benefits of a vaccine can be seen, the targeted badger removals will continue in the medium term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100076#WRY01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Development","counter":1161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100076#WRY02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1162,"qnumday":509,"qnumall":"[6714\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100076#WRY02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will detail the damage to aquaculture operations during the recent stormy weather; the number of fish which escaped as reported to his Department under the licensing conditions for fin fish operations, with specific reference to a company (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he is satisfied that fish escaping from salmon farms have not and will not have an irreversible impact on the genetic integrity of native wild salmon stocks.

","asker":"970","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1199,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 521 and 522 together.<\/p><p>  The Grassland Sheep Scheme is based on Article 68 of the current EU Regulation 73\/2009 which governs direct payments in the form of the Single Payment Scheme. As of the 1 January 2015, that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307\/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form under the provisions of the new CAP Reform Regime. <\/p><p>  Despite these difficulties, I have decided to take action to assist sheep producers. When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer&rsquo;s entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307\/2009 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under an Article 68 Scheme such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme. This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.  <\/p><p>  I have decided to apply this provision as incorporating the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme. In addition, I have increased the total funding under the 2014 Grassland Scheme from &euro;14 million to &euro;15 million. As the 10% modulation deduction will no longer be applied under the 2014 Scheme, this will result in an increase of over &euro;2 million in payments to sheep farmers under the 2014 Scheme. This additional &euro;2 million will also be incorporated to the new entitlement value under the Basic Payment Scheme. In total, sheep farmers with an entitlement value close to the national average will benefit by approximately an additional &euro;14,000 over the seven years of the Basic Payment Scheme. <\/p><p>  Over the past two years sheep numbers have stabilised and while the breeding flock declined slightly in 2013, a return to growth is expected in 2014. I was pleased to note that for the third consecutive year Irish sheep throughput grew, reaching 2.61 million head, a rise of 7%. These developments led to sheepmeat production rising by around 3% to stand just over 55,000 tonnes. The total value of Irish sheepmeat exports is estimated to have increased by over 4% in 2013 to reach &euro;220 million. <\/p><p>  In conclusion as I made it clear at the National Sheep Conference, I am still open to suggestions regarding the provision of additional aid to the sheep sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":1200,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ00450"},{"type":"question","counter":1201,"qnumday":523,"qnumall":"[6858\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ00500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which animal welfare regulations continue to apply to non-thoroughbred sporting and non-sporting horses; the extent to which owner identification registration is currently managed or can be better managed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1202,"content":"<p>My Department currently has statutory responsibility for the welfare and protection of farmed animals only i.e. animals normally bred or kept for the production of food or for use in or for the purpose of farming. The relevant legislation in this area is the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act, 1984 and the European Communities (Welfare of Farmed Animals) Regulations 2010, S.I. 311 of 2010. Veterinary inspectors of my Department enforce this legislation on farms.<\/p><p>  The main statutes governing cruelty to all animals, including non-thoroughbred sporting and non-sporting horses, are the Protection of Animals Act 1911 and the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1965.  Responsibility for enforcing this legislation rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. However, the new Animal Health and Welfare Act consolidates a range of existing legislation in the area of animal welfare. Section 11 of the Act imposes a duty of care on persons in relation to all animals including horses. A person who has a horse(s) in his or her possession or under his or her control must take all necessary steps to ensure the animal is kept and treated in a manner that safeguards its health and welfare and a person who fails to comply with these provisions commits an offence.<\/p><p>  With regard to horse welfare, it is important to note the advice of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council (FAWAC) which recommends that, in situations where an owner can no longer adequately provide for an animal or where the equine can no longer fulfil the purpose for which it was bred, owners should be proactive in seeking to dispose of the animals before their welfare is compromised.   Such action will help prevent the emergence of long-term and severe animal welfare problems. <\/p><p>  The identification and registration of equidae is governed by EU Council Directives 90\/426\/EEC and 90\/427\/EEC and Commission Regulation (EC) No 504\/2008, which have been transposed into national legislation via S.I. No. 357 of 2011 - European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011 (as amended). The EU regulation does not provide for the notification of change of ownership. However, my Department is currently in the process of drafting legislation to provide for the compulsory notification of change of ownership under the Animal Health and Welfare Bill. I expect that this legislation will be published shortly.<\/p><p>  Proposals to amend Regulation 504\/2008 are currently under examination in Brussels. When adopted, the new regulation will significantly strengthen the existing provisions relating to the identification of horses, in particular, by the introduction of an equivocal link between the passport and the horse and notification of change of ownership where this is required by the national of the Member State. It will also give greater powers to the competent authorities in Member States to ensure the effective implementation of these provisions, including through the introduction of minimum criteria which must be met by bodies which issue passports for horses for production and breeding. The expected date of implementation of the new regulation is 1 January 2015. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":1204,"qnumday":524,"qnumall":"[6859\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ00700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of reports of mistreatment of horses of which his Department has been made aware in each of the past three years to date; the extent to which breaches in animal welfare were identified; the action taken or proposed to address such issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Unfortunately many of the animals in question are unidentified, making prosecution very difficult. The on-going work being undertaken by local authorities in conjunction with the Department via the Control of Horses Act, 1996 has reduced the numbers of abandoned horses throughout the country particularly in urban areas. Local authorities are humanely disposing of a considerable number of horses seized under the Control of Horses Act on an on-going basis where there is no possibility of re-homing or returning these horses to their owners. <\/p><p>  As well as setting up the helpline, I have introduced a number of important legislative measures aimed at improving horse welfare. In May 2012 I introduced Regulations that make the registration of premises where horses are held obligatory. I also published a new updated Statutory Instrument on equine identification in March 2013. My Department has also established an equine central data base.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, potentially cruel activities involving animals will be specifically prohibited under the new Animal Health and Welfare Act and involvement in such activities will be an offence.  The Act will also require persons possessing animals to safeguard their welfare and provide them with adequate food, water and shelter. The Act also contains provisions for powers of intervention where an animal is deemed to be at risk of being welfare compromised and the level of penalties to be imposed has been increased. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Industry Issues","counter":1206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ00850"},{"type":"question","counter":1207,"qnumday":525,"qnumall":"[6860\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he and his Department continue to monitor variations in the prices paid to beef farmers here compared with those prevailing in the UK and other European countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It carries out this remit through service contracts with my Department and other agencies including the Health Service Executive , Local Authority Veterinary Service and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.<\/p><p>  Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators. The role of my Department is to verify compliance with these requirements.  This is done by a combination of inspecting establishments and by auditing the food safety management systems which operators are required to have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.  Under current EU regulations, origin labelling is only mandatory for fresh beef and meat coming from  third countries. However, new implementing rules on country of origin labelling for fresh, chilled and frozen sheep, goat, pig and poultry meat were adopted by the European Commission last December. These new rules will apply from 1 April 2015.  My Department carries out labelling checks as part of the routine official checks at meat plants, where there is a permanent presence of Department veterinary or technical staff.  Checks are conducted on a random, risk based frequency and cover labelling, traceability\/origin, identification of cattle, labelling of carcases, meat, mince meat and meat products.  Departmental officials also carry out work to ensure compliance with the application of health and hygiene regulations and traceability within the remit of my own Department. This work is subject to regular audit by both the FSAI and the FVO.  EU law provides for the free movement of goods between Member States. On that basis, meat and meat products produced in an establishment which is approved under the relevant EU regulation can be moved freely within the EU. Food business operators in Ireland are responsible  for carrying out checks to ensure that their ingredients come from approved plants.

My aim is to provide a platform for long-term trading relationships into the future in these sectors, particularly in new and emerging markets and since taking office I have led trade missions to China, the US, Algeria and the Gulf Cooperation Council  countries in the Middle East. In relation to the individual sectors, the latest position is as set out below.<\/p><p>  Market analysis predicts that medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good, with growth in world population and wealth expected to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.  More than 85% of Irish dairy production is exported and Ireland has full market access to over eighty countries worldwide, with one third of the value of dairy exports going outside the EU.  Nevertheless I am working with industry to raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agrifood sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa, the Gulf States and elsewhere.  <\/p><p>  Ireland strongly supported the decision to abolish milk quotas with effect from 1<sup><\/sup>  April 2015 on the basis that quotas were widely regarded by both the Irish dairy sector and market analysts as a brake on the potential of the sector to respond positively to market opportunities.  I expect the abolition of quotas to facilitate an expansion in the sector and through the Food Harvest 2020 Report the industry has set itself an ambitious target for a 50% increase in milk production by 2020.  For my part I have been working on a number of fronts to prepare the industry for the move to a quota free environment and equip it to respond to the market opportunities arising.<\/p><p>  A key element of this market strategy is to optimise the already positive green image of Ireland in order to create a point of differentiation for Irish dairy products on international markets.  In this context, I was delighted to launch the <i>Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme<\/i>   last December.  The scheme has the potential to boost the competitive advantage of Irish dairy products on the global market. Ireland&rsquo;s strong sustainability positioning is fundamental to this.  At processing level, Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green Programme is providing a vehicle for industry to commit itself to sustainability targets by reducing energy inputs, minimising overall carbon footprint and mitigating the impact on the environment.  This proactive approach to environmental sustainability has a strong resonance with procurement strategists in the many multinational food companies who are interested in using Ireland as a source of high quality food ingredients and processed products. <\/p><p>  Of course, the industry itself has a responsibility to focus its efforts on market and product development.  Supported by Government, the Irish dairy sector has succeeded in positioning itself as a major international player and we have seen industry announcements in relation to the development of supply arrangements between Irish companies and multinational players in third countries as well as the development of value-added products which can maximise the value of our dairy output.<\/p><p>  My Department engages on a daily basis with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassies&rsquo; personnel on market access issues. These initiatives have led to a number of notable successes in securing agreement to import from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran which allow the import of Irish beef; with Singapore, South Africa, UAE, Canada and the Russian Federation-Customs Union for the import of Irish sheepmeat and with Australia and Serbia for the import of Irish pork. As recently as January, the Lebanon agreed to re-open its market to Irish beef, sheepmeat and cooked meats.<\/p><p>  In November 2013, the US lifted its ban on the importation of beef from the European Union. This was one of my priorities the previous year when I visited the US, where I pushed the matter strongly with the US Department of Agriculture Secretary of State, Tom Vilsack and in meetings with Senators.  My Department is working with the meat industry to advance the various technical requirements to ensure commencement of the trade at the earliest possible date.<\/p><p>  In December 2013, a delegation from my Department visited China for discussions with authorities there on the lifting of the beef BSE ban which prohibits imports from any EU country. While there are a number of stages to go before Ireland secures access for beef to China, I am hopeful that these can be progressed in 2014.<\/p><p>  Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across EU markets. This wide portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia&rsquo;s differentiation and premiumisation strategy which focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmentally sustainable, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages and superior eating quality. Among Bord Bia&rsquo;s key initiatives this year is the continued development, global promotion and marketing of its Origin Green initiative, designed to establish Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink. Over 200 companies are currently working with Bord Bia to develop, and commit to, sustainability plans setting out clear targets in emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and corporate social responsibility activities.<\/p><p>  There is a strong demand for meat globally and my focus is to enable Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Exports","counter":1221,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1222,"qnumday":530,"qnumall":"[6866\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ01900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which the beef suckler herd remains adequate to meet the demands of future markets; if any particular needs have arisen in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1223,"content":"<p>While suckler cow numbers have remained relatively stable since payments were decoupled from production in January 2005, my Department monitors the composition and strength of the national herd on an ongoing basis.

In that context, I have established a national Discards Implementation Group to advise on the issues arising in the effective implementation of the new policy and to recommend practical solutions and arrangements that take into account the situation of the Irish industry.  <\/p><p>  Another key element of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of the MSY Principle (Maximum Sustainable Yield). This should lead to healthy fish stocks and to higher quotas for Irish fishermen and more sustainable fishing patterns.<\/p><p>  Technical measures will also be introduced to avoid and minimise catches of juvenile fish and the reforms contain a commitment to continue and further strengthen conservation measures in the biologically sensitive area off the South and West coast of Ireland (new Irish box). The commitment to develop and strengthen biologically sensitive areas, with spawning grounds and high populations of juvenile fish will also protect the livelihoods of coastal communities by ensuring that fish are allowed to grow to maturity, are more plentiful and fished in a environmentally responsible manner. <\/p><p>  Finally, and crucially from an Irish perspective, the Hague Preferences have been maintained and given increased reference in this agreement. The Hague Preferences have traditionally given Ireland an increased share of traditional whitefish stocks such as cod, haddock and whiting in the waters off our coast when stock levels are decreasing. It is important to bear in mind that other Member States receive reduced quota as a result of their allocation to Ireland and to the UK and there was no support from other Member States for a specific provision that would have made the application of Hague Preferences a mandatory provision of the CFP.   In that context,  having an increased reference to the Hague Preferences in the recitals of the new CFP Regulation is significant as it can be seen by other Member States as a clear signal of the intent of the Council and the Parliament.<\/p><p>  My plans for the development of the overall seafood sector in the very short term are set out in the Seafood Development Programme 2007-2013, and the complementary Irish Seafood National Programme 2007-2013, which identify the investment priorities for the development of the sector up to 2015.  The Seafood Development Programme includes the overwhelming majority of initiatives for the development of the sector.  That Programme is co-funded by the European Union under the European Fisheries Fund.  It was considerably updated in 2012, following an interim evaluation of its progress.  The Programme identifies the development needs of the catching, processing and aquaculture sectors and the measures that will be implemented to address those needs.  The complementary Irish Seafood National Programme is the framework programme for a small number of measures that are not included in the Seafood Development Programme or are not eligible for EU co-funding.<\/p><p>  My Department is presently preparing a new Operational Programme for the seafood sector for the period 2014-2020 under the proposed EU Regulation for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.  The EU co-legislators recently reached political agreement on this proposed EU Regulation and the Council and European Parliament will vote on the proposal in the coming months.  I would hope to see the Regulation adopted by the Summer. My Department has already conducted a public consultation with stakeholders in 2013 on issues facing the sector and investment priorities for the new Programme.  In the coming months, my Department will continue to work closely with stakeholders as the new plan for the sector is developed.  I would anticipate that the plan will be completed before the end of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Fisheries Policy Reform","counter":1233,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ02650"},{"type":"question","counter":1234,"qnumday":534,"qnumall":"[6870\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the degree to which conservation measures already adopted in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy or otherwise continue to improve fish stocks in traditional Irish fishing waters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1235,"content":"<p>The new Common Fisheries Policy reform agreement, negotiated to completion under the Irish Presidency will mean real meaningful reform to how EU waters are fished in the future.

The policy provides for the development of measures appropriate for each region by the Member States working with the stakeholders through the new Advisory Councils to devise and implement measures that work for the types of fisheries in the region and involving fishermen in the decision making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food and Agriculture Organisation","counter":1236,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1237,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[6871\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ02900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he and his EU colleagues expect the EU food-producing sectors to contribute to world food production in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1238,"content":"<p>Overall, the EU 27 is a mature food producing market with a reasonable balance between food production and consumption.

Food Harvest 2020 sets out a roadmap to achieve a 50% increase in milk production, a 78% increase in aquaculture production as well increasing the value of primary output in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sector by 33%; its value added component by 40% and the value of food and drink exports by 42%. <\/p><p>  Progress on these targets is monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Food Harvest 2020 High Level Implementation Committee , which I chair. Strong industry support and buy-in for the Food Harvest vision has been achieved with a significant pipeline of industry investment in processing and innovation in train. At primary level, farmers have shown an increased focus on efficiency and sustainability and are gearing up for increased milk production once the quota system is removed next year. Progress to date augers well for the achievement of FH2020 targets as the sector has achieved growth in excess of 33% (primary production- CSO 2013 advance estimate), 20% (value-added- CSO 2011 data ) and 24% (exports-Bord Bia 2013 data) compared to the baseline period.  <font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font><\/p><p>  The FAO forecasts that world&rsquo;s population will be over 9 billion in 2050, with up to 70% of the world&rsquo;s population living in urban conglomerations with greatly increased income and calorie consumption levels.

As a food producing and exporting country, Ireland is positioning itself to meet this increasing global demand for food.  On the supply side the sector is increasing its investment and production efficiency levels while opportunities for increased exports are arising from trade and investment missions combined with technical and diplomatic efforts to open new markets and trade areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":1239,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1240,"qnumday":536,"qnumall":"[6878\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100077#WRZ03100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of farmers due rural environment protection scheme 4 and agri-environment options scheme 3 payments who have been paid to date; the number awaiting payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It is my understanding that timing issues between a student finding a placement with a service provider and the time they need to be on placement may not allow for the service provider to obtain Garda vetting on behalf of the student.   In situations where training colleges process Garda vetting for their students and subsequently secure placement of these students in childcare settings, they are not permitted under current Data Protection regulations to release the vetting documents or copies to the childcare service.  It is the position of the Office of the Data  Protection Commissioner that the disclosure of such information to other parties, even with the consent of the vetting subject, is not appropriate and could potentially undermine the integrity of the vetting process.

This includes provision for the Youth Service Grants Scheme under which funding is made available to support 31 national and major regional voluntary organisations involved in the development and provision of youth programmes and services. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.  These schemes support some 477 projects and services, provided by the voluntary youth sector, throughout the country. There are some 1,400 youth work staff and over 40,000 volunteers involved in the provision of these services and activities for young people. In 2014, funding of &euro;50.530m, including &euro;750,000 for a new capital funding programme, has been provided to my Department for these schemes. In addition, capital funding of &euro;1.5m was provided in 2013 for the start-up of new Youth Caf&eacute;s and 30 applications have been approved in locations throughout the country. Details of the successful proposals are available on my Department's website - www.dcya.gov.ie. The funding for these schemes is administered, in the main, by the Education and Training Boards on behalf of my Department.<\/p><p>  Young people are provided with a wide range of programmes and activities, which respond to their needs, interests, capacity and age profile. The supports available are complementary to the school system and to other supports in place to assist young people who are marginalised and contribute to addressing a range of issues affecting young people and their communities including early school leaving, unemployment, drug\/substance misuse, youth homelessness, and the impact of problems to do with juvenile crime and anti-social behaviour. <\/p><p>  Having regard to the difficult funding situation in recent years, no new applications have been sought for these schemes since 2008. My Department, along with all government departments, is required to deliver substantial savings on all funding programmes in line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE).  My Department, in determining the annual allocations for youth programmes, while having regard to the CRE, has sought to ensure that, as far as is possible, the focus is maintained on the front line youth services particularly those for the most vulnerable young people. This year, I secured an additional &euro;1m in the 2014 Budget to offset the impact of the CRE on the youth services. As a result the overall reduction in 2014 budgets for the youth services at 3.75 % was significantly less had been indicated in the CRE.<\/p><p>  Further information about the specific projects and services can be had from the projects themselves or the Youth Officer in the relevant local Education and Training Board or directly from my Department. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind and wishes to make the details available to officials in my Department, they will be more than happy to assist in providing a link to the specific project. <\/p><p>  My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality has overall responsibility in the area of crime and anti-social behaviour and his Department funds a range of youth services, in particular Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) and Young Person Probation Projects (YPP). I see the role of my Department as working in an integrated way to develop strong linkages between all those working in prevention and intervention, developing closer working relationships between the prevention services provided by Child and Family Agency, and services provided by the Irish Youth Justice Service, which is co-located in my Department, and the youth sector. The main focus is on ensuring best outcomes for all our children and young people through the most efficient use of available resources thereby achieving best value for money. I want to ensure, notwithstanding the significant challenges we face, that we build on best practice and continue to innovate to ensure that young people are enabled and empowered to acquire the skills and experiences to realise their potential and to engage and develop in society.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100078#WRAA01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Provision","counter":1273,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100078#WRAA01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1274,"qnumday":547,"qnumall":"[6368\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100078#WRAA01900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the amount of funding that will be made available to each specific project under the design stage of the ABC programme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1275,"content":"<p>The Area Based Childhood (ABC) scheme 2013-2016 is being implemented by my Department, in partnership with Atlantic Philanthropies who are co-funding the programme's total allocation of  &euro;29.7m.

During 2013, I prioritised the implementation of a Pre-School Quality Agenda, which represented a long-awaited programme of measures to support, monitor and regulate the improvement of quality standards in pre-school services in Ireland.   A key element of this Agenda is to strengthen the national pre-school inspection system.<\/p><p>  My Department is working with the Early Years Inspectorate to develop the new protocols on regulatory compliance so that there is greater clarity and consistency of approach as to how inspection reports deal with findings of serious non-compliance as opposed to minor breaches and full compliance.    My Department also reviewed the penalties in place for breach of regulations, and legislative changes have been introduced to allow for an increase in the range and severity of sanctions that can be applied.  <\/p><p>  I understand that the Early Years Inspectorate follows up on complaints and makes visits to services found to be in breach of the regulations.  However until the new legislation was enacted, there were no sanctions that the Inspectorate could impose other than through prosecution in the District  Court. The power to impose conditions and to close services will now give the Inspectorate the capacity to deal with issues more effectively.<\/p><p>  A number of additional measures being introduced will further strengthen the inspection framework. The new National Quality Standards for pre-school services being developed this year will complement the existing Pre-School Regulations replacing previous explanatory notes and will set out the quality outcomes and supporting criteria against which inspection under the pre-school regulations will be measured. <\/p><p>  Standard Operating Procedures have been introduced to address issues of inconsistency and provide greater clarity for pre-school services.  The Early Years Inspectorate transferred from the HSE to the Child and Family Agency when it was established in January last and I am confident that the comprehensive reforms which are being introduced will provide for the operation by the Child and Family Agency of a more consistent and robust pre-school inspection regime.<\/p><p>  On foot of Budget 2014, I will be allocating &euro;4.5m in Exchequer funding to support the implementation of the Pre-School Quality Agenda with &euro;0.5m of this funding being allocated towards the cost of increasing staffing levels to further strengthen the pre-school inspection system. <\/p><p>  The new reforms also provide a statutory basis for registration of pre-school services. Under the new system, which was introduced in January this year, all pre-school services will have to be registered in order to operate. Inspectors will be empowered to specify improvement conditions that a service must comply with.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100078#WRAA02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Child Care Education Issues","counter":1282,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100078#WRAA02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1283,"qnumday":550,"qnumall":"[6416\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100078#WRAA02500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cork has not received the higher capitation grant for the early childhood care and education free preschool year.","asker":"988","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1284,"content":"<p>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which provides a free pre-school year for all children before they commence primary school, is implemented by my Department.

I am advised by the Adoption Authority of Ireland that 44,042 adoptions took place in Ireland between 1953 and 2012.  While records exist in relation these adoptions these records may not be as expansive as current day practices would envisage. <\/p><p>  I am also aware that some of the arrangements which were put in place were not within the provisions of the adoption legislation leaving people assuming they were adopted, when they in fact were not, or that their births were the subject of illegal registrations. Information in regard to illegal registrations is scant as these placements were by their nature shrouded in secrecy. <\/p><p>  Existing procedures for the tracing of birth parents by people who have been adopted are not ideal and I have been anxious to see improvement brought about.  The  Information and Tracing Service of Tusla &ndash; the Child and Family Agency recognises the importance attached to this area of service provision and is working to provide a more streamlined  services  and to ensure that enquiries in regard to information and tracing are handled as quickly as possible. The Agency has advised me that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption, or an illegal registration of a birth, should contact the Adoption Authority of Ireland or the Agency&rsquo;s  Community Services who will assist in directing them to the personnel dealing with their particular records.  The existing arrangements for those seeking access to information reflect a transition from complex and historical situations and I am anxious that the Agency implement much more improved and consistent arrangements. <\/p><p>  The Agency provides an Information and Tracing Service throughout the country to birth mothers, adopted persons and their families. The Adoption Act 2010, requirement that agencies providing Information and Tracing services would gain accreditation resulted in a number of religious orders deciding not to apply for accreditation and transferring records from their Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies to the Agency. Approximately 25,000 records have been transferred to the Agency&rsquo;s Regional Adoption Service in Cork, from the Sacred Heart Adoption Society.   Work by the Agency on the organising and storage of these records has taken place.  The advice of the National Archives has been sought in relation to the proper storage of these records that are of great significance. The Agency has also received records from other agencies.  A comprehensive list of the locations of the records relating to the various adoption societies and Mother and Baby homes   is available on the Agency  website. I would urge birth mothers to enrol on the National Adoption Contact Preference Register (NACPR), which  was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  They decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland has responsibility for the operation of the Contact Preference Register. <\/p><p>  My Department is continuing to work on the Heads of Bill for the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of Bill as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100078#WRAA03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Child Care Education Issues","counter":1297,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100078#WRAA03450"},{"type":"question","counter":1298,"qnumday":555,"qnumall":"[6624\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100078#WRAA03500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the action she intends to take regarding the significant number of unconfirmed higher capitation applications under the ECCE scheme where child care providers have recruited staff on higher salaries and are still awaiting approval for higher capitation rates of funding; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

There are some 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and over 40,000 volunteers involved in the provision of services and activities for young people.   <\/p><p>  Funding is made available on an annual basis to 31 national and major regional youth organisations under the Youth Service Grant Scheme. These organisations are voluntary, not-for-profit organisations or limited companies. The funding for the organisations is intended to ensure the promotion, development and growth of youth organisations with distinctive philosophies and programmes aimed at the social education of young people. <\/p><p>  My Department does not prescribe the pay and conditions or terms of employment of the management or workers in the voluntary youth sector.  These are matters for the boards of management\/directors of the voluntary, not for profit or limited companies. Over the past few years, my Department, along with all government departments, has been required to deliver substantial savings on all funding programmes in line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure. Circulars and notifications issued to national youth organisations and to organisations that administer funding on behalf of my Department, have drawn attention to the on-going requirement to identify the scope for efficiencies in the delivery of services to young people.  National and local organisations and funding administration bodies have been told by my Department that they should be cognisant of any large variances in salary levels, conditions and administrative costs across the projects and services. They have been advised that consideration should be given to the full range of options to reduce pay and pension costs and to measures to increase productivity including extra working hours and reductions in annual leave. They have been asked to consider all potential cost saving measures so that the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected, as far as is possible, from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding. <\/p><p>  During the course of the next few weeks officials of my Department will meet the national youth organisations that are funded under the Youth Services Grant Scheme. The purpose of the meetings is to share knowledge and information about developments to date and to explore further how best to manage efficiently the budgets available for 2014. All options to secure further efficiencies will be discussed, including payroll costs and potential for productivity measures in the interests of ensuring the continued provision of high quality services for young people. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100079#WRBB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":1316,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100079#WRBB00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1317,"qnumday":561,"qnumall":"[6813\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100079#WRBB01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide details of all official engagements by her or the Ministers of State in her Department that have taken place in Northern Ireland since she took office; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1318,"content":"<p>The details of all official engagements that I have attended in Northern Ireland are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Date<\/th><th>Location<\/th><th>Group \/ Individuals<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>20\/07\/2011<\/td><td>Armagh<\/td><td>North South Health Sectoral Meeting<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>02\/02\/2012<\/td><td>Armagh<\/td><td>North South Health Sectoral Meeting<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>03\/03\/2012<\/td><td>Belfast, Co.Down<\/td><td>Attend ACCORD Golden Jubilee Conference Dinner<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>04\/03\/2012<\/td><td>Belfast, Co.Down<\/td><td>Attend Interdenominational Service for WAVE<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18\/07\/2012<\/td><td>Armagh<\/td><td>North South Health Sectoral Meeting<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>21\/11\/2012<\/td><td>Armagh<\/td><td>North South Health Sectoral Meeting<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>21\/11\/2012<\/td><td>Armagh<\/td><td>Meeting with Junior Ministers Jonathan Bell &amp;amp; Jennifer McCann<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>08\/11\/2013<\/td><td>Armagh<\/td><td>North South Plenary Meeting<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100079#WRBB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"R&eacute;amhscoileanna Gaeilge","counter":1319,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100079#WRBB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1320,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[6910\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100079#WRBB01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"an f&eacute;idir l&eacute;i gn&eacute; den Ghaeilge a ionchorpr&uacute; in oili&uacute;int oideachais agus oili&uacute;int c&uacute;ram&oacute;ir&iacute; gairmi&uacute;la i gcomhth&eacute;acs na n-&aacute;iseanna c&uacute;raim leana&iacute;, go h&aacute;irithe i gceantair ina bhfuil c&eacute;atad&aacute;n measartha den phobal ag labhairt na Gaeilge.","asker":"1110","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1321,"qnumday":563,"qnumall":"[6911\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100079#WRBB01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"an bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar &aacute;bhar de chuid na Sc&eacute;ime um Ch&uacute;ram agus Oideachas Luath-&Oacute;ige (COLO) agus mura bhfuil, an f&eacute;idir breathn&uacute; air sin, i gcomhth&eacute;acs na haidhme forioml&aacute;ine l&iacute;on na ndaoine a &uacute;s&aacute;ideann an Ghaeilge a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; agus tac&uacute; le hinmharthanacht lean&uacute;nach na Ch&eacute;ad Teanga, thr&iacute; ghn&eacute; de mh&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge sa sc&eacute;im sin a thabhairt isteach.","asker":"1110","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1322,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 562 and 563 together.<\/p><p>  Tugadh an cl&aacute;r um Ch&uacute;ram agus Oideachas na Luath-&oacute;ige (COL&Oacute;) isteach i M&iacute; Ean&aacute;ir 2010 agus cuireann s&eacute; bliain r&eacute;amhscola&iacute;ochta ar f&aacute;il at&aacute; saor in aisce do gach leanbh inch&aacute;ilithe sula dtosa&iacute;onn siad ar an mbunscoil.

Ireland has a significant alcohol problem which needs decisive and innovative action to address it.  Last October the Government approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  These measures are based on the recommendations contained in the <i>Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy.<\/i><\/p><p>  The aim is to reduce alcohol consumption to the OECD average by 2020 (i.e. 9.1 litres of pure alcohol per capita per annum).  In 2011 the average per-capita pure alcohol consumption for everyone over the age of 15 was 11.63 litres in Ireland.<\/p><p>  A broad range of complementary measures is required to successfully reduce consumption of, and harms associated with, alcohol misuse.  The package of measures to be implemented will include provision for minimum unit pricing, regulation of the marketing and advertising of alcohol, regulation of sports sponsorship, structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets and labelling of alcohol products.<\/p><p>  Minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels per gram of alcohol that must be legally observed by retailers in both the on and off trade sector.  Its primary function would be thus to discourage at risk levels of alcohol consumption and is targeted in particular at harmful and hazardous drinking.  The Government also agreed that new low risk limits for alcohol consumption be introduced based on Irish standard drink of 10 grams of alcohol i.e 11 standard drinks or 112 grams of pure alcohol per week for women and 17 standard drinks or 168 grams of pure alcohol per week for men.<\/p><p>  Work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing.  A health impact assessment, in conjunction with Northern Ireland, was commissioned in 2013, as part of the process of developing a legislative basis for minimum unit pricing.  The health impact assessment will study the impact of different minimum prices on a range of areas such as health, crime and likely economic impact.  The study should be finalised by mid-2014. <\/p><p>  My Department has also written to the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group, established by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources asking the Group to take into consideration the significant role the internet plays in alcohol advertising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100080#WRCC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Health Policy","counter":1396,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100080#WRCC02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1397,"qnumday":588,"qnumall":"[6384\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100080#WRCC02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the establishment of the healthy Ireland council; the number of positions available; if he will provide a full job description of the roles available; when recruitment is likely to take place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

They also provide a public health nutrition role, improving infant feeding practices through their public health nurse colleagues, supporting community cooking classes and other nutrition prevention programmes across the schools and community setting.  <\/p><p>  As nutrition related illnesses are on the increase, the need for these services is also increasing.  Dietetic services accept referrals from both General Medical Services (GMS) and non GMS clients.  Referrals are accepted from general practitioners (GPs) and all members of the Primary Care Team and other network colleagues.  They accept self-referrals only from clients wishing to avail of the Diabetes X-pert structured patient education programme and group weight management programmes in the community.  They also accept referrals from their hospital colleagues when transferring clients' care to the community.  A prioritisation system is in place with malnutrition (adult and faltering growth in infants), home enteral tube feeding, diabetes and paediatric patients being prioritised.  However, due to varying staffing levels around the country and the increasing demand in nutrition related diseases, access to dietetic services varies in some parts of the country.<\/p><p>  The Dietetic service to the long stay residential units for older people is delivered as part of the primary care service in some areas with a prioritisation system in place.  Nutrition Training on malnutrition screening is provided to front line staff by the dieticians.  A clinical dietetic service is provided to the units, usually to high priority patients, including those who are malnourished and those on PEG feeding.  Access to dietetic services varies across the country with some residential units getting a visit monthly\/bi-monthly and some weekly by the dietician, depending on bed numbers and dietetic services locally.  HSE dieticians do not currently provide a service to private nursing homes.  However, these patients, if mobile, will be seen by the dietician in their clinic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100083#WRFF02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prescription Charges","counter":1542,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100083#WRFF02250"},{"type":"question","counter":1543,"qnumday":641,"qnumall":"[6808\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021100083#WRFF02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will reverse the decision to increase the prescription charge for persons on the State pension who are holders of medical cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
