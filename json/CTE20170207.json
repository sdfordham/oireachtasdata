I will deal with NewERA first.  To many, the methodology behind NewERA and the failure to meet the EUROSTAT test undermined the whole concept behind and reason for the establishment of the water charging system.  It would appear that passing the test is not now possible.  I am conscious of the recommendations of the expert commissions and some questions emanating from that in respect of borrowings.  What is the current borrowing cost of Irish Water in comparison to ten-year Government bonds?  I ask this because, at present, I believe borrowing is done on a yearly basis.  Is that correct?<\/p> <p>  If the State is to become the sole customer of domestic water tariffs, is it feasible to borrow on the markets whether it be by Irish Water or its parent company, Ervia, thereafter?  Has Irish Water undertaken an analysis of this shift, as proposed by the expert commission report?  It was published some time ago and I am sure there has been some consideration of the recommendations contained in it.  It would be interesting to hear at this juncture whether there is any comment from NewERA in respect of this issue.  <\/p> <p>  Some would say that the cessation of water metering was on the cards anyway because we were led to believe that 300,000 properties could not be metered.  Has the shift of any remaining metering to district metering affected borrowing capacity if that remains a commitment or the wish of Irish Water even with the State being its only customer in respect of domestic charges?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020700002#E00300","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486468800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I will provide some context for the report.  It is primarily about the most cost-effective way currently for Irish Water to fund its commercial facilities in the context of the decision by EUROSTAT and in light of the suspension of domestic charges.  The report looked specifically at the cost of current commercial facilities for Irish Water, which are on a one-year basis, and compared it with what the State is funding on a one-year basis.  Based on an interest rate of 1.4% for Irish Water and -0.4% for the State, we would calculate that this amounts to an interest rate saving of about &euro;14 million for the State so that is the primary context for the report.<\/p><p> On longer term funding rates for the State, Irish Water is not funding long term.  Under any circumstances, in the usual order of merit State funds are cheapest.  Semi-State and commercial semi-State bodies fund with a premium, while Irish Water is in a different phase of its development.  If we compare the five-year cost of debt for Irish Water hypothetically because it is not currently funded with the cost of five-year debt for the State, it is cheaper for the State.  From its perspective, given current circumstances, for the foreseeable future the most cost-effective way of funding Irish Water is through the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020700002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Fitzpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>If one was to apply today's figures over a period of ten years, the cost would be &euro;140 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020700002#F00200","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486468800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The cost to the State now is 1.2%.

The consequence of that is that in order to get to an off-balance sheet position by 2018 or 2019 a higher rate or projection of a future higher rate of domestic water charges would be required.

I would have pointed to that when first before the committee.  In terms of examining scenarios and revenue streams that may come from an excess charge, this will depend on where it is set and the objective to be achieved.  For instance, the plastic bag levy is an environmental charge that is designed to change behaviour.  It is not intended to be a sustainable revenue source over the long term.  This will be something that causes people to adapt their behaviour in order to conserve water and which will also have an impact on production costs over the long term.

We all have our views on what constitutes excessive usage.  I appreciate the Commission for Energy Regulation will be tasked with setting the figure.  The witnesses specifically referred in their submission to the importance of a dissuasive argument for those who are prone to wasting water, or even to determine whether people are wasting water.  What are the views of the witnesses on the level at which this should be set?<\/p> <p>  We have a very obvious question of fairness, particularly to those who provide their own water supply, such as group water schemes throughout the country.  They provide a significant saving to the Exchequer.  In the long term, it is most likely cheaper for them to provide the water supply to their communities than for the State to do so in certain instances.  Otherwise, I would argue, group water schemes would not exist.  How do we square this circle?  How do we deal with the basic inequality we will have if the current arrangement is adopted through the expert report, with regard to people paying for excessive usage versus those in private group schemes who will pay a charge regardless?  I understand there is State subvention, and this has been restored as of the suspension date to 2015 levels.  I know the witnesses are calling for additional subsidies, and it is in the report which is helpful no doubt to group water schemes.  What are the views of the witnesses on this?<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe it is possible for private group schemes to provide the service the State provides in housing estates throughout the country cheaper than the State provides it?

All the while, hundreds of thousands of people already pay for water and their local community water services.  With very few exceptions, certainly in the advice with which we have been provided, I have seen examples of excellence in the service provided by group water schemes, no more than by State providers.<\/p><p>Do the witnesses have a view on the ongoing sustainability of the group schemes they represent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020700002#R00200","speaker":"1300","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486468800,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I will deal first with the second issue on fairness and equity.  I presume the Deputy is talking about Irish Water and other service providers versus the group water scheme sector.  As mentioned in our submission, since the late 1990s when domestic water charges were abandoned on the public water supplies, the group water scheme sector has been getting a subvention towards the cost of supply and treatment of domestic water services.  That has been in place since then.  Group water schemes come together as a group, assess their own individual overall costs, assess what they can get through the subsidy and then agree among themselves as a group with the leadership of the committee of management or board of directors as to what they are prepared to contribute directly towards the costs of their group water supply scheme.<\/p> <p>  That subsidy has been reviewed a number of times since then.  We have a partnership arrangement with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, as it was, and now the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  We review that on behalf of the schemes with that Department.  In all instances we have had a good relationship with the Department and found that it takes our views on costs into account.  That review has always been an upward review, apart from the time when domestic water charges were reintroduced when we had a reduction in that subsidy.<\/p> <p>  Irrespective of what comes out of this process, whether it be a charge based on excessive usage, a charge that is based on a charge that is there currently but suspended, or no charge at all, we would expect to sit down with the Department.  We have received assurances from the Department, and I am sure all the people here would give us the same assurances, as to what this committee would recommend.<\/p> <p>  We have been given assurances that we will get a review of that subsidy and that situation.  We have flagged, and we always would flag, additional charges that have arisen since the previous review in 2008.  We refer to some of those charges here and we would expect those additional costs to be taken into account in any review.  The equity arises in the operation and maintenance cost.  We would expect that equity would continue to apply through that process.<\/p> <p>  Group water schemes have been getting capital grants towards the capital costs of new group water schemes and upgrading old group water schemes.  The old group water schemes I am talking about in were installed in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.  Those group water schemes were effectively in a mess in the late 1990s and were the subject of a European Court of Justice case.  There had always been grants for the group water scheme sector, but at that stage the grants were significantly increased.  A serious amount of work was done under that rural water programme, as it was, again in partnership with the Department and local authorities through the national rural water services committee.  That work has been done.<\/p> <p>  Without fear of contradiction, I can say that at this stage the group water scheme sector, through that grant aid process, is probably in a better position from an infrastructural point of view than Irish Water.  All the reports we have seen to date indicate that Irish Water is in need of serious investment in order to bring its infrastructure up to date.  We are ahead of the posse there and have achieved that through that grant aid.  We would expect that grant aid to continue through the process if that level of support is there for Irish Water and its capital costs.<\/p> <p>  Group water schemes contribute towards the initial capital costs and the capital costs of any improvements and replacement infrastructure.  It is a programme that is very focused on getting value for money and only replacing infrastructure where it is needed.  Around all that, through that rural water programme, the whole area of metering came into play big time.<\/p><p> Group water scheme committees of management would have been iffy about metering in the beginning.  Through the process of metering, and I mean individual meters for tens of thousands of members across hundreds of group water schemes right around the country, it immediately became very evident that most or at least a very high proportion of the excessive usage or leakage, whatever we want to call it, was on the consumer side of the meter, particularly when the contribution mechanism based on volume of usage came in.  Through that, the usage and demand came down.  The amount of infrastructure required also came down, such as reservoir storage.  There were instances where projects for planned reservoirs could be abandoned because of the reduction in usage.  That was one of the savings.  There was a saving for operational maintenance costs since the more water put through a system, the more maintenance required.  That has come about through all that.  Group schemes would say, without contradiction, that universal metering as a management tool and as a water conservation tool on their group water schemes, combined with a reasonable charge on usage over and above a free allowance, has been the single driving force behind the overall transformation of the sector.<\/p><p> I will address excessive usage and what it constitutes.  Our research on the group water scheme sector, and we can only deal with the thousands of members on group water schemes that we talk about, shows that the average usage of a household would range from about 120 cu. m to 150 cu. m per annum.  That would be based on metered usage in the context of a metered water charge over a particular free allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020700002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt Mr. Brady.

It is actually 20 years ago this month since the co-operative, collaborative approach to subsidy arrangements was made for group water schemes.

It was most impressive and useful.  The main recommendation of the Expert Commission on Domestic Public Water Services and the duty of this committee thereafter is to find a funding mechanism to deal with the implementation of that.  In recommending that the State become the main customer for provision of domestic use, it also, to inform Deputy Farrell, recommends and asks that we seek greater parity and equality for those who fund that from their own resources in addition to State help and assistance.  That point has to be made.  It is our duty and what we want to do.  We want to get some information from the witnesses that allows us to be in a position to make a recommendation that can close that gap.  It has not been closed in recent years, I would add.<\/p> <p>  I have some specific questions to help to do that.  Has the National Federation of Group Water Schemes calculated the estimated cost per household of a group water scheme bill?  In other words, what is the average bill throughout the country?  Has it calculated that and can it be made available to the committee?  How much would complete subsidisation of group water schemes cost per annum, to equalise completely with the public provision?  What is the current average subsidy per group scheme from the State?  How does that equate to the customer, the end user?<\/p><p>In other words, what is the average subsidisation in respect of each user?  We will end up with subsidisation if we proceed along the road in respect of public supply and we did not compare that with existing subsidisation of the rural sector so that we can seek to address parity, if necessary.  The agreement we reached with Fine Gael put a pathway in place to deal with this issue and allow the Government to continue to function so as to deal with many other pressing issues, as we saw last night, for example.  Can the witnesses confirm that grant aid was reinstated when we suspended charges?  Did it increase because a commitment was given that it would increase?  As authors of the agreement, we need to know to ensure that what we were seeking at that time, namely, to ensure greater parity and equality, has been achieved.  This committee has a greater responsibility to ensure greater parity and equality in the event of it making a recommendation to the D&aacute;il for its acceptance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020700002#T00600","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486468800,"counter":200,"content":"<p>In respect of the Deputy's final point regarding confirmation that the grant aid has been reinstated, there are two different type of schemes.

In South Dublin County Council, people have to pay i&euro;3,000, &euro;4,000 and, sometimes, &euro;5,000 now.  I would be interested to hear more from Mr. Brady in his detail written response about what kinds of works those capital grants go towards.  What do they cover?  What do they not cover?  This will allow us to try to make a comparison between the capital cost for a household in a group water scheme in rural Ireland versus those in an urban area.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Brady's submission also referred to the reduction in consumption, which in some cases was between 60% and 80%.

Has Mr. Brady any data on that?<\/p> <p>  Some of us in urban areas in Dublin still have group water schemes.  My experience is that some very much like being in group water schemes and do not want that to change.  They want equity and parity in terms of whatever outcome there is for others.  However, I also deal with people in group water schemes who would prefer to be in the public water system.  The difficulty, of course, is that historically the local authority was not able to fund the work, so in a sense they are outside the public water scheme but not by choice.  How reflective are those two experiences of Mr. Brady's affiliates?  Is there a desire among some to retain their current position but, obviously, to improve its funding?

We have worked with Irish Water and the Department, in a partnership way, to develop protocols and procedures in this regard.  Those protocols and procedures are as good as finalised at this stage and work has started on taking over those schemes.

As members will see from the submission from the federation, there is a lot more pipework in a group water scheme per household than there is for households under Irish Water.  Therefore, the measure was essential.  Obviously, the bulk meter did a significant job in identifying sections of main posing a problem.  The tendency in the local group scheme was to believe the system was leaking like a sieve, leading to the view that the pipework should be replaced.  Replacing the pipework would not have actually solved the problem because most of the loss was not in the pipe at all but on the consumer side of the connection.  We could not have identified that without the individual meters.  That explains what we very much tend to favour.

It states that to ignore the group water scheme subsidy arrangement introduced originally when public domestic water charges were abolished in the late 1990s leads to a one-sided debate and an unnecessary and unhelpful urban&ndash;rural division on the water issue.  The good news, it states, is that advance payments at the restored subsidy rate were paid out to schemes in mid-December by way of a supplementary payment.  For me, that is very important because there has been an attempt to create an urban&ndash;rural divide, which is not at all helpful.  Those of us who campaigned against water charges did so for everybody.  Is it fair to say the fortunes of those on group water schemes, in terms of the amount they end up paying out of their own pocket, have fluctuated in line with those of people in the public water scheme, albeit not to a point of complete fairness because I do not believe such a point exists?

I think that is the key issue, and hopefully that will be progressed.  There is a long lead-in period to it, getting all the ducks in a row.  That is likely to begin, we hope, sooner rather than later, because many of the schemes are orphan schemes which are in a diabolical state with no committee of management.  Sometimes they are connected to one another.

The other issue in regard to that, and where charges in group water schemes can rise, is that in order to comply with drinking water regulations it is no longer sufficient to operate group water schemes in a voluntary capacity.  There is need for professional, paid management and caretakers to meet these regulations, and we are working with the group water schemes again.  We have a lot of management structures in place.  That is just one of the areas where there might be an increase in costs associated with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020700002#Y00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I would like a bit more time to expand on some of these questions.  Is it true to say that prior to the introduction of the rural water programme the management of group water schemes was quite haphazard and varied significantly from scheme to scheme?  Some schemes had paid staff to actively manage the consumption of the scheme.  Quite a lot of schemes had none.  The figures in regard to consumption and things like that are quite skewed because the first active look at the consumption figures on schemes was in conjunction with the major capital investment under the rural water programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020700002#Y00900","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486468800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>It would have been based on actual consumption on those particular schemes, but I take the point.  Effectively, group water schemes were put in the ground on day one.  They were left to their own devices for the most part, and they were being funded entirely by the members of the group water schemes.  The people operating those schemes did a serious job in the context of the resources and time they had available to them.  It was for the most part a voluntary effort by very good volunteers.  Volunteers can manage group water schemes very effectively.  The point I am making is that the public health issues in the regulations do not allow the schemes to continue in that capacity into the future but there will always be a place for volunteers in group water schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020700002#Y01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I am not disputing the work or doing anything to denigrate the work that people do in a voluntary capacity in group schemes but the point that I am making is that we are not really comparing like with like.  The group water scheme sector has done a huge amount of work in improving the quality and standard of water on their supplies.  With regard the information that we have asked for in regard to the average cost of schemes, it is important for the work of the committee to actually link that to the individual schemes and the type of treatment that is on the scheme.  Many schemes would have simple disinfection whereas other schemes would have quite detailed dissolved air floatation, DAF, machinery which would mean different costs.  It would be useful for the committee if the average costs were actually tied into the type of treatment used in the schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020700002#Y01100","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":256,"content":"<p>That is a very valuable point.
