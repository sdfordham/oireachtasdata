Section 28(1) requires that postal tariffs meet certain standards, including that they be affordable, transparent, non-discriminatory and related to costs.  ComReg's powers under section 28(5) need strengthening.  The Bill proposes the repeal of the very considerable and specific powers under section 30 of the 2011 Act.  This is a corollary to that.  Section 30 established the price cap to control postal tariffs where no effective competition exists.

These directives were transposed into Irish law by the 2011 Act.  Article 12 of the directive provides member states shall ensure the tariffs for each of the services forming part of the universal service comply with the tariff principles.<\/p> <p>  The requirements are clearly intended to apply only to the universal postal service and it was on this basis the 2011 Act was drafted.  Extending these provisions beyond the universal service would represent a significant change in policy and would require detailed consideration and analysis as well as consultation with stakeholders.  In any event, regulatory measures are generally introduced to address issues arising in a particular market and should only, in line with the principle of proportionality, be introduced when necessary.

In truth when looking at the business there is effectively no real competition in the widespread range of postal services in a market of Ireland's size and given the nature of the postal services.  It is not just in the universal postal service provision this effective monopoly takes place.  There are sections of the processing system that may be contracted out but it is not an entire alternative service system.

It is simply not appropriate to ask it to adjudge that An Post may fail.  Deputy Stanley's amendments were ruled out of order.  As outlined on Second Stage, the repeal of the price cap mechanism has been identified as the most viable option for supporting An Post in the short term while the restructuring plan arising from the McKinsey review is implemented.  This decision was not taken lightly by the Government.  An in-depth review of the company took place in recent months on behalf of the shareholding Minister.  It confirmed the seriousness of the situation facing An Post.<\/p> <p>  While I understand where Deputy Stanley is coming from, the fundamental problem is the profound structural change in the mail business in Ireland and internationally.  Electronic substitution has had a significant impact on that business.  This is particularly apparent in respect of large volume postal customers such as banks and utility providers.  This business is becoming increasingly unstable, with volumes fluctuating on a month-to-month basis, making it difficult for An Post to plan.  In such circumstances, it is impossible to predict with certainty what the future holds in terms of volume decline.  As this information is central to determining the cap for pricing, current market conditions make it difficult to implement an effective and appropriate price cap mechanism.  In drafting the Bill, the Minister has considered whether an alternative regulatory structure around pricing could be provided for but, given the urgent need to address the challenges facing An Post, this was not possible in the time available.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is cognisant of the impact that this measure might have on consumers in the SME sector.  For this reason, the Bill provides that ComReg will undertake a review of the repeal of the price cap mechanism after a two-year period.  He has issued a policy direction to An Post instructing that price increases introduced following the repeal must be subjected to prior consultation with ComReg and have due regard to the tariff principles set out in section 28 of the 2011 Act and the interests of personal and SME users of postal services.  This will ensure that An Post does not abuse its position.  Following the repeal, the Minister will continue to monitor closely the activities of An Post in terms of stamp prices, but he does not have the final say.<\/p> <p>  The Bill's purpose is to repeal the price cap, but Deputy Stanley's amendment was to reintroduce it in another way.  There was no time to reintroduce regulation.

I sought some further information but I understand the documentation is very sparse and we have no firm details on the proposed takeover.  Neither has the committee.  There is no advisory group report although I understand one may be in the process of being written for the BAI.  In these circumstances, it is extremely difficult to give an informed opinion on this matter.  I can only say that, in these circumstances, one has to look to the first principles.  I draw the members' attention, in particular, to the form available for applicants in media mergers or takeovers.  It is very practical and arises in some respects from the report of the media mergers advisory group, on which I sat.  It gives concrete indicators of diversity such that when one is examining a potential takeover, one may have regard to a broad range of impacts, including prior performance of the media organisation proposing to make a takeover, including its employment policies.  This is, perhaps, a way of assessing what any organisational impact might be.  In the case in question, for example, one could consider the manner in which INM parted company with a particular correspondent in regard to the Garda whistleblower affair and decide whether that raises questions about the positions of staff in the organisation to be taken over.  One could also examine a broad range of employment matters, including the likely impact on diversity in regard to such aspects of media as the representation of minorities and gender balance.  There are far too many factors and concrete indicators for me to rehearse here in five minutes.  I strongly refer the members to the forum I have mentioned, which is of very great value.<\/p> <p>  Some people regard this kind of takeover in personal terms.  I do not although I must say I have some difficulties appearing before a committing looking at a takeover by INM, on which Deputy Michael Lowry sits.  I am here anyway at the request of the committee.  I believe there is a conflict of interest.  I do not see this in personal terms.  I believe that INM could be taken over tomorrow by the organisation that includes Fox News or Breitbart News, for example, just as TV3 could be bought by Silvio Berlusconi.  These are matters of public interest.  It is terribly important at this time that we protect the freedom and diversity of the media.  We can see from the United States that when the fairness doctrine was abolished, the media there went on a slippery slope.  We have now arrived at a position in which there seems to be difficulty in distinguishing between fact and alternative realities.  It is up to the members to make the decisions that matter in these cases.<\/p> <p>  It is ultimately a political, moral and aesthetic decision on the part of the people who control media policies as to what kind of media we have.  It is not a mathematical formula.  No competition authority applying sheer statistics in regard to readership, audiences or percentages of ownership can arrive at a satisfactory solution.  The kind of media and policy environment we have is one of choice.  It is the responsibility of people to make that choice based on the kind of society we want and the kind of media we want.<\/p><p>That will not change.  No amount of balancing statistics can replace the decision the D&aacute;il must make.<\/p><p> The procedure is very awkward.  I do not quite understand how it came about that at the end of the day the Joint Committee of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is asked to consider the matter before the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, has considered it and without having access to a report from an advisory council.  It puts the committee in a very awkward position, but it can certainly affirm the need for diversity, having regard to the various concrete indicators of diversity that I have mentioned and are in the form that the applicants have to provide to the committee.  <\/p><p> I have provided a written statement which goes into much more detail, but I was asked to limit my oral contribution to five minutes.  I have spoken for five minutes.

It is a great honour to be here.<\/p> <p>  I draw the members' attention to a number of reports, looking at Ireland as well as many other countries in the world, which concentrate on media ownership.  Reporters without Borders, RSF, describes the concentration of media ownership in Ireland as a major problem.  The American human rights organisation, Freedom House, which reported on Ireland in 2016, said in reference to press freedom that a \"high concentration of ownership affects plurality and competitiveness in the sector\".  A recent report for the European Commission conducted by Dr. Roderick Flynn showed that Ireland was high risk in terms of concentration of media ownership.  <\/p> <p>  In another report commissioned by Sinn F&eacute;in's Ms Lynn Boylan MEP, Ireland was described as having one of the most concentrated media markets in any democracy.  The issue of the concentration of media ownership is well known and well documented.  We are aware that a media whose ownership is highly concentrated is seen as damaging for democracy and it has been assumed for nearly 200 hundred years that multiplicity of media outlets is the lifeblood of debate and ensures citizen can receive as a wide a range of views and opinions as is possible, whether it is about politics or the economy as well as other aspects of life, including education and culture.  The more concentrated the market is, the more exposed it is to the lack of variety and content.<\/p> <p>  Coming to the issue before us, it is assumed in the legislation that media is not like other business endeavours.  The whole reason we are here is because media differs from other types of commercial activity.  The reason that the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 passed responsibility for media mergers from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources reflects that point.  The Minister can now determine whether a proposed media merger would be contrary to the public interest in protecting the plurality of media.  That is stated quite explicitly in the guidelines, which I will not read as members have probably seen them.  It should be noted that when the guidelines were issued by the then Minister, Mr. Alex White, there was criticism that they and the legal changes were too little and too late and nothing could be done retrospectively.  There is a Bill before the D&aacute;il, sponsored by Deputies Catherine Murphy and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, that hopes to address that retrospective issue.  In the meantime, there is no doubt that if Independent News &amp;amp; Media Holdings Limited, INM, is allowed to acquire the Celtic Media newspapers, it will strengthen INM's already dominant position and mean that INM will be by far the biggest single player in the regional newspaper market.<\/p> <p>  Cross-media ownership and plurality impact very directly on the people who live in the areas served by Celtic Media.  They currently have access to an independent newspaper, produced in their locality.  After a takeover, those same people might be receiving their national news, local news and possibly radio news all from the same company or from media organisations linked to one another through shareholding.  INM has suggested the takeover of Celtic Media is nothing more than a business or commercial decision, with no further implications.  The deal would lead to possible synergies, according to INM, as I have read, which in itself is worrying.  Synergies could mean the outsourcing of some editorial functions, such as sub-editing as has happened with INM titles, or even one newsroom serving a number of titles, thereby reducing the number of reporters and impacting negatively on the gathering of local news.  This has happened already with radio stations. <\/p> <p>  As stated, if INM's acquisition of Celtic Media goes ahead, it will control 28 regional newspaper titles in addition to its five national titles.  The radio sector is also a factor, given that the Communicorp Group, which is owned by the same major majority shareholder as INM, controls Newstalk, Today FM, 98 FM, Spin 1038 and Spin South West, or 20% of the radio market.  When one looks at the Dublin, one will see a larger figure, where Communicorp radio stations are higher than RTE.  It is essential when looking at media ownership in Ireland that the cross-media ownership by INM and Communicorp Group is considered at the same time.<\/p> <p>  The Government's case is that nothing can be done retrospectively about media ownership because of the constitutional protection of private property which could, of course, be tested if Deputies Catherine Murphy and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall's Bill is allowed to proceed.  However, if dealings with media ownership retrospectively is impossible, it would be unwise at this stage to allow a company to expand in the face of almost universal agreement that there is a problem with the degree of media ownership concentration in Ireland.  The signal the Minister would be sending is that the Government has no intention of addressing a major issue facing Irish democracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael Foley"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Foley.

I think the reason I am here is because in addition to this being a research focus, I am the Irish rapporteur for the media pluralism monitor, which as Dr. Foley has pointed out, identified the Irish communications market in terms of concentration as constituting a high risk.<\/p> <p>  It might be helpful if I briefly rehearse how we got to this point.  Some 22 years ago, the Irish Newspaper Commission, among other things, looked at the question of the degree of pluralism and diversity in Irish media.  It concluded that there was sufficient diversity at that point, that is, in 1995, but that any further diminution in competition and consolidation of ownership would create an issue.  Immediately after that we had a more or less helter-skelter deluge of media acquisitions, starting with the UK player, Scottish Radio Holding and Trinity Mirror coming into the radio and print media markets.  This prompted the Population Communications International, PCI, Media Impact in 2001 to adjust their ownership and control policy.  Under some pressure from the Competition Authority, which was looking for a more relaxed approach to media ownership and as a consequence in 2001, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, announced a new lighter touch approach to regulation and ownership thresholds, which existed at the time, were substantially relaxed.<\/p> <p>  Up to that point no individual or firm could own more than 27% of any individual media outlet.  This related to BCI regulated media, that is, to radio stations.  The new limit was no more than 25% of an entire sector, right across the radio sector and, therefore, 100% ownership of up to a quarter of all BCI licensed radio stations was possible from this point onwards.  The BCI's competence at that point did not extend to print media and its new rules made no reference to television but coincidentally in the period after than between 2001 and 2007, there was a deluge of radio and print acquisitions, mainly in the local and regional markets.  These went largely unchallenged by the competition authorities, successive Ministers for enterprise and by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.  By my reckoning, there were almost 90 media mergers between 1995 and 2008, of which perhaps three were subjected to any kind of extensive scrutiny.<\/p> <p>  By 2008, a number of groups were emerging in the print sector, including Independent News &amp;amp; Media Holdings Limited, which had been there since the 1970s, Johnston Publishing, Alpha Newspaper Group, Dunfermline Press which becomes the Celtic Media Newspaper Limited and Thomas Crosbie Holdings.  One could add smaller groups, but these are the main players.  In radio, the incumbent players was RTE, Scottish Radio Holdings, which in turn was taken over by Emap, UTV, Thomas Crosbie Holdings and Communicorp Group Limited.<\/p><p>In 2007, we had the last major acquisition in this phase, namely, the acquisition by Communicorp of Emap Holdings, that is, Today FM, FM 104 and Highland Radio.  I mention this because the acquisition was unusual in that it was subjected to a full-scale investigation by the then Competition Authority.  However, even before the authority completed its work, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland stepped in to announce it would not sign off on the sale of FM 104 as part of the deal as this would have placed both national commercial stations and the two leading Dublin commercial stations in the hands of a single company.  Although the acquisition proceeded, FM 104 was immediately sold off to ITV. <\/p><p> The net effect of all this is that, over the course of a decade between 1998 and 2008, we moved from a position whereby local media in particular were largely constituted of privately owned and often family owned independent operations to a position whereby all but a handful of commercial radio stations and nearly every local newspaper with a significant circulation had been absorbed into larger media groups.  The scale and pace of this concentration attracted some political attention and in 2008, the advisory group on media mergers, on which Professor Colum Kenny sat, was established to assess whether media merger regulation was up to scratch.  The conclusions of the advisory group were that, although it was ultimately the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment who determined whether a merger should proceed, it was the Competition Authority which performed the assessments informing the Minister's judgment.  The advisory committee noted, however, that the Competition Authority's expertise lay in assessing the market impact - I emphasise that term - of media acquisitions.  By its own admission over the previous years, the Competition Authority was not competent to assess the impact of such acquisitions on pluralism and diversity.  I emphasise that the former is an economic question, whereas the latter is a political one.  Consequently, the advisory group recommended that responsibility for approving mergers be shifted from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the then Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  This was meant to reflect the shift from viewing media acquisitions through a purely economic prism to  viewing them from a political as well as an economic or market perspective.  While it took six years to implement this recommendation, it finally emerged in the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014.  As of today, although the Competition and Consumer Protection Authority still plays a role, responsibility for assessing media mergers is shared with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and, potentially, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. <\/p><p> Since the introduction of the 2014 Act, there have been six significant media acquisitions, namely, UTV on two occasions, TV3, Setanta, UTV's radio holdings and the acquisition that is currently under review.  In all of these cases, the media holdings in question have been acquired by much larger media groups, namely, Liberty Global, News Corporation, Eir and now Independent News and Media.  If we accept that the media play a constitutive role in the operation of a health democracy - that may be a banal observation but it is also true - it is striking that until the proposed acquisition of Celtic Media Newspapers by INM, none of the recent acquisitions had been subjected to an in-depth examination.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Roderick Flynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Flynn and invite Mr. Frank Mulrennan of the Celtic Media Group to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#F00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486468800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Chairman and members of the joint committee, I am the chief executive officer of Celtic Media Newspapers Limited, and I represent 98 colleagues who work in six newspaper centres in Mullingar, Athlone, Cavan, Navan, Tullamore and Castlebar.  I am joined by Mr. Tadhg Carey, editor of the <i>Westmeath Independent<\/i>and <i>Offaly Independent<\/i>newspapers, which have a proud heritage in providing good journalism and solid community coverage since 1846.  Mr. Carey will make some opening remarks in a few moments.<br\/><br\/>Having been a journalist for the first 18 years of my career, I have a great commitment to editors having full autonomy in their decision making.  I have secured full guarantees that this editorial independence will continue under our newspaper titles when the sale to Independent News and Media is approved.  For the past 16 years, I have been managing local newspaper titles and I have seen our industry go from the Celtic tiger years when high prices were paid, primarily by British investors, for local Irish newspapers to a position in which, since 2008, the business model in local newspapers is broken.  <br\/><br\/>Our company and the jobs of 98 colleagues earning more than &euro;4.2 million in salaries almost went out of business in 2012 due to the weight of bank debts and continually falling revenues.  My colleagues were extremely supportive of the management buy-out which I led in 2012 and under which their jobs and 950 years of newspaper history were secured.  It is important to make the joint committee aware that we took the very progressive decision to allocate 25% of the equity in the company from the management buy-out to our editors, sales managers and a production manager.  Mr. Carey is one of the beneficiaries of this decision. <br\/><br\/>We borrowed &euro;5.5 million in June 2012 in the teeth of recession.  Five years later, we are faced with a broken business model in terms of publishing local newspapers or, dare I say it, newspapers in general.  For this reason, we ask members to approach this sale approval process with an open mind and to ignore the considerable noise around this issue in the national media, which has nothing to do with the job security of my colleagues.<br\/><br\/>While I have great regard for the contribution of our media academics, I respectfully suggest that the tone of today's contributions would be different if we had an economic consultant or business analyst before the joint committee because we are dealing with tough commercial reality.  For example, since 2008 the regional newspaper industry, the business in which I work, has suffered a 65% fall in print advertising and a 35% fall in circulation revenues.  I take Dr. Flynn's point about the health of the business prior to that time.  Since 2008, however, only one investment has been made in local newspapers, namely, when Johnston Press was sold in 2014.  Nobody else has seen fit to invest in local newspapers since.  While there has been major growth in digital advertising, three quarters of this growth is going to Facebook and Google.<br\/><br\/>I respectfully suggest that the interests of my colleagues and the future of our newspapers will be best protected through being part of a larger company with funds to invest in a digital platform and marketing.  I know the company in question will provide the editorial independence that I want to protect.  I ask members to bear in mind that this sale was approved by the Competition and Consumer Protection Authority at the first stage because there is no overlap in the titles.  While the sale is very important to the Celtic Media Group, members should note that it only adds 3% to the circulation of Independent News and Media.  <br\/><br\/>If Dr. Foley will excuse me, I wish to correct a point he made.  The number of titles involved in this sale when it is approved is not 28 but 20 and a good number of the titles are small.  There are two other fine companies in the local newspaper companies, namely, Iconic Newspapers, which as 13 titles, and Landmark Media.  My colleagues are in the process of making submissions to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and do so of their own accord.  I understand our sales team is making a collective submission and that my 20 pre-press colleagues in Mullingar will also make a collective submission.

I can honestly state I never thought our small local newspapers would ever be the focus of leader articles in Sunday newspapers, receive so much coverage on the airwaves or the subject of Oireachtas debates such as this.  I am here as an editor and a journalist working in Athlone with a newspaper that was founded in 1846 in the midst of the Famine.  It is a newspaper which has a long, proud and distinguished record of reporting for over 170 years in its community.<br\/><br\/>While in Ireland there is a unique commitment to provide local news and many of the 76 regional newspaper titles in the Republic are older than the State, the harsh reality is that the traditional newspaper model is no longer commercially sustainable.  While I respect the expertise and knowledge of the three previous delegates and found their contributions very interesting from an overall perspective, I was a little surprised that there was no reference to the difficulties in the sector.  As Mr. Frank Mulrennan referenced, I have seen newspapers in the midlands close, including <i>Roscommon Champion<\/i>, <i>Longford News<\/i>, <i>Athlone Voice<\/i>and <i>Offaly Express<\/i>, with two of which I previously spent time working.  I have seen significant job losses in this industry in the past 16 years.  The average regional newspaper now employs 50% of its 2000 staffing level.  In my company journalists have taken pay reductions and embraced the changes in how we report news items across a number of platforms.  They have been flexible and adaptable, but we are effectively swimming against the growing tide of digital dominance.<br\/><br\/>It is vital that the joint committee understand competition does not just come from other newspapers, it also comes from social media, including Google and Facebook, which are swallowing up ever-increasing slices of Irish marketing budgets.  Despite this, we, in Celtic Media, have worked very hard to build our digital presence.  We are proud of having more than 500,000 monthly visitors to our websites and more than 150,000 social media followers of our titles, while continuing to produce quality weekly newspapers.  The reality is, however, that we are not at the races in achieving a decent digital commercial return, certainly anything that will compensate for the decline in advertising and circulation revenues, about which the committee has heard previously.  Only through being part of a larger group that can facilitate a much larger investment in a digital presence can small newspapers such as ours hope to survive in the future.<br\/><br\/>As I said, I am here as a working journalist and an editor.  I am privileged and honoured to be in the position of editor of two fine regional newspapers.  It is a special role.  I agree fully with Dr. Foley when he says newspapers are not solely a commercial product.  Regional newspapers have a real value and a special place in the rural communities that they serve.  Long-standing newspapers such as my own, <i>Westmeath Independent <\/i>and <i>Offaly Independent<\/i>, are embedded in community life.  They are part and parcel of the community.  Each week, with each addition, we hold up a mirror for the community in which to see itself.  For me, if media plurality is to mean anything, it must mean the continuation of local newspapers such as my own, <i>Westmeath Independent<\/i>and <i>Offaly Independent,<\/i>in whatever form and securing the jobs these titles bring.  That is my sole driving motivation in being before the committee.<br\/><br\/>As an editor, it is very much welcome that INM has stated in its written submission to the Minister, Deputy Denis Naugten, that our newspapers will continue as independent publications with editors who will have full and effective independence and that they will continue with dedicated staff on the ground whose function it will be to produce the content needed to serve local areas.  It is also stated in the submission that there is no intention on the part of INM to make material changes to the operating policies of the newspapers following the transaction.  This includes the policies on staff pay, the frequency and size of the publications and the information gathering practices used by staff reporters.  It is these commitments and the imperative for future investment to secure the newspapers that have led me and my fellow editors across the group to support the decision to sell the company to one with the necessary resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tadhg Carey"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carey.

I will address the committee first on the reasons for the proposed acquisition by INM of Celtic Media Newspapers.  Mr. Lennon will talk about the INM regional newspapers.<br\/><br\/>The agreement for the sale and purchase of the entire issued share capital of CMNL Limited by INM was executed on 2 September 2016.  In line with media merger requirements, INM and CMNL jointly submitted a notification to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, on 5 September 2016.  On 10 November 2016 the CCPC determined that the transaction would not lead to a substantial lessening of competition in any market for goods or services in the State.  INM believes the proposed transaction will not be contrary to the public interest in protecting plurality of media in the State.<br\/><br\/>INM is a media company operating in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  All of its operations are based on the island of Ireland and it provides direct employment for more than 800 people and many more indirectly.  Its newspapers far predate its existence, with papers such as <i>The Sligo Champion<\/i>which was founded in 1836 and <i>The Kerryman<\/i>which was founded in 1904.  Of its national titles,<i>Irish Independent <\/i>was first published in 1905.  Other papers are also household names, including <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>, <i>The Herald<\/i>, <i>Sunday World<\/i>, <i>Wexford People <\/i>and other regional titles.<br\/><br\/>Towards the end of the last decade the industry as a whole suffered a material decline in revenue.  In 2008 INM announced losses of &euro;161.4 million.  In early 2009 the company failed to reach agreement with bondholders on a figure of &euro;200 million which cast doubt on its ability to continue as a going concern.  Following material support from shareholders, the board, management and staff, the company underwent major restructuring.  Since dealing with these legacy issues, INM's financial position has stabilised.  It remains challenged, however, by the disruption it faces from the growth of digital in the industry.  Nevertheless, investment from its own resources in creating a viable digital future for all of its titles has seen positive growth in this channel.  The indigenous newspaper publishing industry, both local and national, has faced and continues to be challenged by severe disruption.  As a result, it has seen a decline of 62% in print advertising revenues since 2007 and a decline of 39% in circulation volumes since the same year.  Continuing programmes of redundancies across the industry, with the existence of several titles under threat, are also a fact of life in the industry.<br\/><br\/>The financial challenges which have impacted on the publishing industry have resulted in the closure of many regional and national titles.  The pressures brought on by the recession led to the closure by Alpha Newspapers of three local newspaper titles in Ireland in 2010: <i>Roscommon Champion<\/i>, <i>Longford News <\/i>and <i>Athlone Voice<\/i>.  At the time Deputy Denis Naughten, now Minister, was reported as saying, &quot;The closure of the papers is devastating news for the 40 employees who will lose their jobs, but it is also a major blow for the area.&quot;<br\/><br\/>A cornerstone of democracy is an independent free press.  To maintain independence, media enterprises must be financially sustainable and capable of survival.  News organisations have faced increasing pressure to remain commercially viable.  As a result, consolidation and collaboration have become commonplace in the global newspaper industry.  In Ireland INM and <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, INM's primary competitor in the national market, have entered into agreements, whereby <i>The Irish Times<\/i>prints certain INM titles and Newspread, our distribution business, distributes <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  Such collaboration has become essential to ensure publishers remain competitive.<\/p><p>INM expects collaboration to become more commonplace in the future.  Consolidation has allowed publishers to use centralised back office functions and infrastructure to produce newspapers of high quality, despite falling revenues.  Consolidation is the only real means to ensure the continuation of many titles, the protection of jobs and the survival of newspapers and this actually protects the diversity of views.  The proposed acquisition will benefit CMNL by enabling access to the financial and operational resources of a larger parent company, without any impact on editorial independence.<\/p><p> By 2015 the financial position of INM was such that the company was in a position to evaluate acquisition opportunities.  INM believes it has an obligation to its domestic market to use its resources to sustain and improve the existing newspaper offer on the island of Ireland and the jobs that are necessary to support that.  The proposed transaction with Celtic Media Newspapers demonstrates this belief.  The transaction is beneficial to regional papers in general and to Celtic Media in particular.  It will provide much needed financial support and will secure the future of Celtic Media's seven titles as well as the associated jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Pitt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Mr. Lennon, managing director of INM regionals, has five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#H00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486468800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I have 30 years experience in the Irish newspaper industry, having joined INM in 1992 and am managing director of INM regional titles.  INM is a fully committed publisher of regional newpapers.  We have some of the oldest papers in the country and are very proud of them.  We publish 13 regional titles, including the <i>Drogheda Independent<\/i>, the <i>Argus<\/i>in Dundalk, <i>Wicklow People<\/i>, <i>Wexford People<\/i>, <i>The Kerryman<\/i>, <i>The Corkman<\/i>and <i>The Sligo Champion<\/i>, in Louth, Wexford, Wicklow, Cork, Kerry and Sligo.  INM takes its role as custodian of these titles very seriously and we have great belief in the future of local press.  Local newspapers provide quality local news for local people.  Social media platforms such as Facebook, although hugely popular and used by almost everybody in the country, cannot provide the professionally produced content presented by our local journalists.  Our elected and appointed officials engage with their community through their local papers and news of what happens locally is vital.  The employment of local people produces a multiplier effect as the wages earned by employees of local papers are spent in the local community.  The importance of local papers was best summarised by the Taoiseach and reported in <i>The Sligo Weekender<\/i>, a competitor title to ours, in Sligo at the launch of local newspaper week in October 2011:<\/p><blockquote>Of course, the first duty of local papers is to inform the reader, both on local and national stories, but they also do much more than that.  In fact they are a vital part of the fabric of rural life, serving to cement our links to our communities and always providing an insight into the bustling society of Ireland's towns and villages.<\/blockquote> <p>Celtic Media Newspapers employs just short of 100 people in Meath, Cavan, Westmeath, Offaly and Mayo.  Approximately 45 people are employed in the company's print plant in Navan.  Like all regional newspapers, the company has experienced some difficulties.  It has had significant investment in a new publishing system and has funded redundancies, allied to ever-declining revenues.  Unfortunately, ever-declining revenues are what we, in the print business, are facing.  The long-term viability and quality of Celtic Media Newspapers could be at risk if the proposed transaction does not go ahead.<br\/><br\/>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission determined that, although both INM Holdings and Celtic Media are involved in publishing local and regional newspapers, the proposed transaction &quot;does not give rise to horizontal overlaps in different local-regional areas for the publication of local-regional newspapers based on readership&quot;.  This is demonstrated in a map in the written submission.  If the transaction proceeds, there will be 14 counties in the Republic of Ireland with no INM regional or Celtic Media title.  In each of the areas where Celtic Media and INM regionals currently operate there are numerous other competing titles, which are further detailed in our written submission.<br\/><br\/>Under INM ownership there will be no change to Celtic Media's current editorial policy and practice.  Editors of Celtic Media's titles, along with INM's regional editors, will continue to have full autonomy over the content of their newspapers.  Celtic Media newspapers will retain their individual editorial standards and these will be exactly the same to the readers of those publications as they are now.  By providing financial support to Celtic Media the proposed transaction will secure the future of Celtic Media's titles and related high quality employment in Meath, Westmeath, Cavan, Offaly and Mayo.  The proposed acquisition will ensure that the distinctive voice of Celtic Media newspapers will continue long into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Lennon"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley is the Irish secretary of the National Union of Journalists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#H00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486468800,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I have over 30 years experience as a production journalist with the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>and before that I worked as editor of the <i>Roscommon Champion<\/i>and was a reporter with <i>The Tullamore Tribune<\/i>.  On my first day at the Roscommon Champion I covered a meeting of Roscommon County Council which Senator Leyden attended, though he may have been Deputy Leyden at the time.  My hand was slapped by a reporter from the rival paper when a political opponent of Deputy Doherty spoke and she said &quot;We don't take him&quot;.  <i>The Roscommon Herald <\/i>had a policy of favouring one Deputy and it illustrated the importance, at an early stage for me, of diversity and plurality in the regional media sector.<br\/><br\/>We requested this hearing because it is the only opportunity for public scrutiny of this proposed acquisition.  With me is Bernie N&iacute; Fhlatharta, leas-chathaoirleach of the Irish executive council and a freelance reporter and broadcaster who has worked for <i>The Connacht Tribune<\/i>, and Ian McGuinness, Irish organiser of the NUJ.  Both of them will be free to take questions.<br\/><br\/>The guidelines on media mergers provide the framework for the deliberations of this committee.  The work of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has been done and the function of this committee is to examine the issue of media plurality.  The guidelines are a useful starting point for this.  I share the views of Tadhg Carey, a member of the NUJ and a shareholder of Celtic Media, and many of my former colleagues have also been made redundant by Independent News and Media, when it decided to outsource editorial production to Yorkshire.  <br\/><br\/>The NUJ has a long history of opposing media concentration of ownership.  Our first intervention was in 1973 when Tony O'Reilly acquired Independent Newspapers and when the late Justin Keating advised our future president of the union, John Devine, that no politician would have the courage to take on someone who bought ink by the barrel.  Our opposition then, as it is now, was based on a belief in the importance of media diversity and not on personalities.  If the focus of the debate on media ownership has appeared to concentrate on Independent News and Media, on Communicorp or on Denis O'Brien, it is because successive Governments have allowed a concentration of ownership to develop, directly and indirectly.  The committee is obliged, under the media mergers guidelines, to look not just at the reach of Independent Newspapers but also at Communicorp.  None of the previous speakers from Independent News and Media or Celtic Media mentioned the significant interest held by Communicorp within Independent News and Media but that cross-ownership distinguishes this from other acquisitions.<br\/><br\/>The issue of ownership is all too frequently assumed to be about direct editorial interference by owners and shareholders on editorial content.  In many ways this is simplistic, as ownership is linked to financial control and determines the priority given to editorial budgets.  It determines business models, wages and payments and conditions.  It determines one's pension, or absence thereof, and the corporate approach to pensions, which was illustrated in the recent developments in Independent News and Media, an issue with which we deal in our submission.<\/p><p>I point out to the committee that it is entitled to ask Independent News &amp;amp; Media about its failure to honour commitments given to the Pensions Authority of Ireland.  Under the guidelines, the committee has a clear responsibility to ask questions relating to corporate governance.  The committee is entitled to question Independent News &amp;amp; Media on developments involving the proposed sale of Newstalk to it and the circumstances which led to public statements involving the chair and chief executive of the company.<br\/><br\/>The creation of the post of editor-in-chief at Independent Newspapers in June 2013 marked a new departure.  It is worth noting that the editor-in-chief reports directly to the group chief executive.  Under the merger guidelines, the committee is also entitled to question editorial structures.  The committee and the BAI are entitled to examine the potential of centralised editorial structures and we encourage such deliberations.  They are also entitled to examine not just the current situation, but the implications for the future too.<br\/><br\/>Our BAI submission outlines concerns relating to the business and editorial model adopted by Independent News &amp;amp; Media and the potential implications for media plurality if Celtic Media is incorporated under the INM regional banner.  I welcome the comments of Mr. Lennon but I regret, however, that he was not in place when Independent News &amp;amp; Media ignored that same logic about local involvement when it closed the titles in north County Dublin and centralised them in Drogheda.  It may seem inconceivable that the editing and production of the titles involved would be centralised but there was a time when it was inconceivable that editorial production of the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>, <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, <i>Sunday World<\/i>and <i>Evening Herald <\/i>would be outsourced to Yorkshire, but that is what happened last year.  When the <i>Belfast Telegraph <\/i>was acquired by Independent Newspapers, commitments were given about the maintenance of editorial diversity.  However, the sharing of copy between the <i>Belfast Telegraph <\/i>and INM titles is not uncommon.  I draw the committee's attention to the impact on freelance journalists and media plurality by the corporate approach to freelance copyright and we have included a copy of the document which freelance journalists are required to sign in order to secure work.<br\/><br\/>Obviously, I am answering 20 minutes on the two companies in five.  For illustrative purposes, we have produced a set of maps which illustrate the respective ownership of Independent News &amp;amp; Media and Celtic Media Group.<br\/><br\/>I believe the role of the regional paper and the role of the national newspapers are important.  We welcomed the acquisition of Celtic Media Group by Mr. Mulrennan and have worked closely with him.  NUJ members have made sacrifices to ensure its viability but those sacrifices were not made so that a larger group could acquire a leaner and cheaper machine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for keeping their contributions brief because I want to open the floor to the members.

As we know, INM publishes the <i>Irish Independent, Sunday Independent<\/i>, the <i>Evening Herald<\/i>, the <i>Sunday World<\/i>and the <i>Belfast Telegraph<\/i>.

I think I speak for all of us when I say that we are as aware of what this means to our graduates as to others when we speak about unemployment in the newspaper industry.  However, we have a particular role here.  We are here to balance, I suppose, what might be a commercial interest with the public interest.  It is a complicated process and I see that point.  I recall one time when I was very involved in the NUJ.  I was on its Irish council and we had to speak to our members in the <i>Sunday Tribune<\/i>because the union opposed the then partial takeover of the <i>Sunday Tribune<\/i>by Independent News &amp;amp; Media.  Our members there feared for their jobs.  There was a tension between what the union nationally believed was right and in the public interest and the individual concerns of our members.

The implied question is whether there is some relationship between ownership and editorial.  Our problem is that there is very little research in Ireland and internationally on what happens when something gets taken over by an existing media group.  The one piece of research I would point to, and modesty forbids it, is my own, but it is a very small piece of research that is tentative.  It compared Independent News &amp;amp; Media coverage with every other newspaper group's coverage of events relating to the major shareholder over the course of the past few years.  It did not point to a glaring distinction between Independent News &amp;amp; Media's coverage and that offered by other newspaper groups, but it did point to a distinction.  It was a distinction of emphasis rather than a distinction such as \"someone is good\" and \"someone is bad\".  It was not remotely that obvious, but there was clearly a distinction.  To me, that tentatively suggests that there is some connection.  If we have a situation, as we already do, where one newspaper group accounts for between 45% and 50% of daily and Sunday newspaper sales, that constitutes some kind of influence, albeit one that is diluted by the increasing availability of other media forms.<\/p> <p>  The second point is on the emphasis on consolidation being the only way of saving things.  I am a political economist and I know the maths involved.  There were 1.2 million Sunday sales in 2007 and 650,000 in 2013.  That is a collapse.  It is not as bad in the daily market, but nor is it good.  At its peak, Johnston Press spent &euro;300 million acquiring its 18 titles.  It sold 14 titles for &euro;8.5 million.  That is a collapse and I get that the maths are significant.  However, this is our question: is it better to let something go under and not have it exist or to allow it to be part of a much larger media group?<\/p> <p>  There may be an alternative to consolidation, however.  It is outside the gift of the committee to introduce it but the idea that consolidation might be the only way that we can preserve the vital function played by regional and local media needs to be examined.  We need to seriously contemplate whether this is the point at which we contemplate public funding of not just broadcasting in the country, but of public service media production.  That could involve print and online platforms.  I see no particular reason for the BAI sound and vision fund to be limited to supporting broadcasting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Roderick Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Thank you.

This is an important issue.  The importance of local media reporting on local issues has been highlighted very well by Mr. Gerry Lennon and others.  The business case and the business element and competition end of it has been ruled on and that has been parked.  That is done.<\/p><p>It is the question that has been raised.  Concern has been raised about the fact that INM is involved in national newspapers and the business of local newspapers is different.  We are having this discussion because there is public concern.  There is also concern within trade union circles, journalists, former journalists and in political circles.  The concerns relate to three areas.  The first is plurality and diversity.  The second is the public interest, while the third relates to the terms and conditions of workers.  The main concern is the dominance of INM, in particular Denis O'Brien and his influence.  The case will be made by INM that there is not editorial control.  I do not believe someone is holding the hand of journalists or editors but he who pays the piper always calls the tune.  The evidence is in the pages of the newspapers.  When one reads them, one sees the relentless pursuit of a political agenda.  In the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>one can see commentaries written by three Deputies from one particular party.  That should be encouraged.  I do not have a problem with that and the party I represent does not have a problem with scrutiny of political parties, including Sinn F&eacute;in.  Scrutiny should be vigorous, but it must also be balanced.  However, the question is whether two or three Deputies from the political party I represent or those from other parties will be allowed to have the same coverage.<br\/><br\/>Another concern is the use of legal avenues to slap down opposition.  A total of 12 cases has been taken by Denis O&rsquo;Brien against media organisations and there have also been threats of legal action.  I am not interested in personalising the situation but we must look at the issue as it stands.  The newspapers are now referred to as &quot;viewspapers&quot;.  Newspapers should carry views but they should also have balanced news content and that is where the problem arises.  I do not think democracy can function without having a free press.  Any objective read of INM publications will show there is a particular editorial line.  The big concern is around centralised editorial content and consolidation of editorial content in that local editors do not have the same influence as was previously the case.  Former journalists to whom I have spoken said they might not have been told what to write but they knew what not to write in newspapers.<br\/><br\/>I am interested in the views of Robert Pitt and Gerry Lennon on how we protect the editorial independence of local titles, which are valuable.  I have dealt with Tadhg Carey's newspaper in the past when we had a larger constituency.  Could they comment on how we maintain the plurality and diversity of content, given the sheer weight of the financial interest of a small number of individuals?  I am also concerned about the protection of workers in those titles.  People in the media not just in INM, but right across a range of newspapers, in the past two years in particular have approached politicians to say their terms and conditions have gone through the floor.  They said do not get a chance to research the content of the stories they write, that their work is hampered and the quality of what is being produced is not up to standard.  In tandem, their terms and conditions have reduced.  They are employed on temporary contracts and they are in a very precarious situation.  I do not envy them.  They are the three issues that must be addressed, namely, editorial independence, diversity and plurality of content and the terms and conditions of workers, in addition to how we protect those working in the media in terms of pursuing stories and having the time to research them without being hampered in their efforts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#J00900","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming here and I welcome their voluntary participation.

Listening to today's contributions, it is evident that media ownership is one thing but whether the media will survive in the future is the key issue.  When one looks at the reduction in sales, which was 65% in recent years, the main issue is if the merger goes ahead, will all the eggs in the media industry will be in the one basket and if that large conglomerate will survive.

It is obvious that the company has and had financial difficulties for a considerable amount of time.

I ask the representatives to explain the finances of the company and what other options were considered.  In the light of having examined those options, what is the alternative?  If there is no alternative, does it mean the closure and loss of the titles?<\/p><p>It is all very fine for the experts here to tell us about what they would like to see and what we should have in terms of plurality.  When it comes to the crunch this is about business, the economics of the business and whether the business can sustain itself.  I am a very strong supporter of provincial media and local titles.  In my own constituency of Tipperary we have three newspapers, namely, the <i>Tipperary Star, The Nenagh Guardian<\/i>and <i>The Nationalist<\/i>.  They fulfil a valuable, important and influential role.  The public has a great attachment to the titles and supports them on a week in, week out.  I am also in contact with those people and I understand the precarious financial position they are in and how difficult it is for them to survive.  Every other week they face declining revenue from advertisements.  There has also been a huge drop in sales revenue due to the influence of local radio, digital and online options.<\/p><p>When it comes down to it, it is about survival.  I would like the editorial independence of provincial groups preserved because it is hugely important to do so.  Like some of my colleagues, I am not overly impressed with the editorial management of some of our national media over the past number of years.

We borrowed &euro;5.5 million in the teeth of recession from Lloyds Bank.  It was a remarkable achievement to secure funding from a Scottish bank for a local newspaper group in rural Ireland.  Dare I say it, we are very good at what we do.  I am very proud of what we do as a management team.  We have paid back a good deal of the loan.  We paid it back in the teeth of a 65% decline in advertising since 2008 and a 35% decline in circulation.<br\/><br\/>We have looked at other business models.  Deputy Lowry will know that a very fine newspaper in his own area, <i>The Nenagh Guardian<\/i>, is a very fine client of ours.  We pre-press, which is a fancy name for graphically design, <i>The Nenagh Guardian<\/i>in Mullingar.  We provide the <i>The Nenagh Guardian<\/i>, <i>Tuam Herald, Galway Independent, Cork Independent <\/i>and other fine newspapers with that service.  We do so because the consolidation of services is crucial in order to take costs out of a business, which is not a bad term.  By taking costs out of a business at that level one provides resources to invest in local journalism, whether it is in Tipperary, Wexford or wherever and to invest in local advertising sales. <br\/><br\/>Did we consider other options?  Yes.  We have rebuilt our business model in Mullingar, of which Senator Davitt will be well aware.  We have between 20 and 24 people employed in Blackhall Place in Mullingar.  They are great people.  They are very loyal colleagues.  I am very gratified that they will make a submission of their own accord to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  They have worked with me and Mr. Carey to rebuild our business model.  However, we cannot row against the digital tide, so my board of directors and I have given strong consideration to the alternatives.  When Independent News and Media approached us, we gave it a very strong hearing because the only future is through digital and marketing, which takes resources.  <br\/><br\/>I totally get the discussion around media diversity but I will outline the harsh reality of running a business.  I appreciate what Senator Leyden has said.  We have put our Cavan and Navan newspaper offices on the market and we are going to put our Athlone office on the market.  The Cavan premises, located at Station House from which the old Midland Great Western Railway line ran, is a fine building.  Let us be straight about it, we are selling the building to pay a bridging loan because this sale has been so delayed.  I respect the legislation and the democratic process but I run a business and we are incurring substantial delays and costs and the professional fees around this very small deal are shocking, with all due respect to the professional advisers.  <br\/><br\/>We are talking about a sale which is worth less than &euro;4 million.  When one subtracts professional fees and the money that my company must repay to the bank, we are talking about a lot less than &euro;4 million.  Nobody will escape to the Bahamas and we will turn up to work on the following Monday when this sale takes place.  I urge the committee to please consider the commercial reality of these jobs in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Mulrennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Lennon and Mr. Pitt to answer Deputy Stanley's question about protecting editorial independence and maintaining plurality.

I will also address Deputy Stanley's question about the terms and conditions of employees.<\/p> <p>  In terms of editorial independence, I can say quite categorically that the editorial function within INM stands alone.  It is solely responsible for the views, tone and direction of the paper.  Obviously, there is structure within that function.  We have an editor-in-chief and editors of the national newspapers who reporter to that editor-in-chief.<\/p><p>We also have specialists within each area.<br\/><br\/>Regarding our regional newspapers, our regional editors stand completely independently with their titles and do not report into the editors of our national newspapers or to our editor-in-chief.  The local editors are completely responsible for the content in their newspapers.  The only management interaction we have, and Mr. Dooley referred to the fact the editor-in-chief works very closely with me, is to talk about budgets.  We talk about the plan for the finances of the operation going forward.  We also talk about the marketing support that is necessary to allow those newspapers tell their readers about what will be in the newspaper and why they should buy it.  We also plan circulation with them because we have to procure paper, ink and distribution capacity for them.  I can say quite categorically that the function stands, very proudly, alone within our business.  That is the correct way for it to be.  <br\/><br\/>Regarding plurality or the diversity of content, it is quite clear within Independent News and Media, INM, that there are already very different voices within the newspapers we publish and offer to readers.  Among out national titles, the <i>Sunday World<\/i>is a very different newspaper from the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>in terms of the reader it speaks to, the content it has and the things that are important to people.  Within the newspapers themselves, the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>is a very good example of a newspaper that can have very different views, directly opposite each other.  We have, for example, columnists who would be regarded as quite left-wing, championing people who might not be the typical reader of the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>.  Those are very welcomes voices in that newspaper.<br\/><br\/>Among our regional newspapers, the editor of a paper in Kerry reports on very different matters and with a very different tone from the editor of a paper in Wexford might do because they are completely different parts of the country with different priorities, and different issues are important to them.  Unemployment, for example, could be very different in one area from another area.  Infrastructure investment is another example.  We can quite safely say that there is already huge diversity within INM and that the newspapers have the freedom to protect that and to maintain their individual voices.  We guarantee that with the transaction to acquire the newspapers of Celtic Media those newspapers will remain independent.  What will happen is that they will achieve the financial security to ensure they can, without fear or favour, write and talk about the things that are important.  I made the point in my presentation that a strong media is very important.  That strong media, however, has to be commercially viable.  That is very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Pitt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>On the terms and conditions, before I move on-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#M00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486468800,"counter":115,"content":"<p>On the terms and conditions, we are guaranteeing all the rights of all the employees who are coming in.

The issues of not adhering to agreements with the Pensions Authority and of failure to consult pension trustees are legitimate questions for this committee, the BAI and the Minister under the terms of the notification form.  The Senator may wish it to be otherwise but that is the reality.<\/p> <p>  On notification of members, yes, we have consulted all the chapels.  The NUJ is rather quaint in that we do not have branches but we have chapels.  Deputy Lowry is an Independent Deputy so only has to agree with himself but no more than in the Rural Independent Group or in any other political party, there are people who have different views but the settled view of our chapels is that we should oppose this.  Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta will deal with the issue of our branches.  We consulted with our members as recently as yesterday.  I am aware that senior members of management have asked our chapels and our individuals to make submissions against the NUJ policy and that they have decided not to do so.  They have been put in a particularly difficult position because the people inviting them to do so are their managers now and will be their managers in the future.  I understand that there is a strong commitment.  <\/p> <p>  We are all on the one side here.  We absolutely want the newspapers to survive.

I have five questions and I will put them as succinctly as I can.  The first two are to Mr. Pitt.  They are effectively around concerns which his &quot;future&quot; employees might have.  Could Mr. Pitt have handled the defined benefit scheme changes differently?  Could he have communicated it to his editorial staff differently and was the way he did it arbitrary?  Should that be a concern to staff in future?  Should there be a concern for staff around the closure of the printing works in the<i>Belfast Telegraph<\/i>?  I do not say this in a derogatory way but it is my understanding that INM was something of an absentee landlord there when it closed the printing works.  I hope Mr. Pitt will correct me if I am wrong but there would be concern there.<\/p><p>Could I ask Mr. Mulrennan specifically about the sale of the Station House in Cavan town?  Why is it for sale?  I know he has made reference to it.  I would have understood our publication to be a fairly vibrant one.  Is it for sale to bail out other publications, or is there an alternative?  I would like a commitment from Mr. Mulrennan, and from the proposed purchasers, that the whole operation would stay in Cavan.  I understand from informal conversation with staff members in Cavan that they have an expectation that it would but I would like a very public statement that it would stay in Cavan.<\/p><p>I would like to ask all the witnesses specifically about community news, the legendary coverage of court cases, council meetings, education and training boards and so on.  That is very important to local communities.<\/p><p>That kind of thing involves a fair concentration of staff and a great deal of effort.  Will there be no diminution of that?  I would not like to see any.  In fact, I would not support anything that involved a diminution of that important service for local communities.  Linked to that is the question of editorial control.  Can I again be assured in that regard?  It would be very remiss of me not to ask.  While we are all parochial to a degree about these things, I am very concerned about the staff of <i>The Anglo-Celt<\/i>and its excellent journalists and editor.  We have a lovely community of which they are very much a part.  I want to know that the editorial control of the outstanding editor of <i>The Anglo-Celt<\/i>is in no way diminished.  How is that assured in the deal and what protocols are in place?<br\/><br\/>Lastly, I address the jobs question.  I mentioned independence, but I also want to know that the jobs in <i>The Anglo-Celt<\/i>and the other publications to which I referred are safe.  Of course, I mentioned <i>The Anglo-Celt<\/i>in particular, but one wants the jobs everywhere to survive as they are so important to the fabric of rural Ireland.  To lose 100 jobs in rural Ireland is the equivalent of losing perhaps 1,000 jobs in a large metropolitan area.  They are irreplaceable.  It demoralises a community to lose quality jobs and people.  As such, I want to know that the jobs will stay.  That is why I addressed to Mr. Mulrennan and others earlier the question of location.  I want the jobs to stay on location.  Can the witnesses provide me with assurances around the jobs and what is in the protocols there?<br\/><br\/>We are all on the same page here.  We want a diverse, pluralistic and good newspaper service which is accessible to everyone.  We want people working on it.  With the greatest respect to those who talk about State subsidisation, when one looked last night at the fact that we have people with scoliosis and spinal difficulties waiting to get operations for a long time, I am not sure we can subsidise newspapers in advance of dealing with that.

If I recall rightly, he said that when it came to the crunch, it was all about the business model.  My view is that when it comes to the crunch, it is all about what is in the public interest in terms of the House and how we do our work.  For me, the critical issue is cross-media ownership.  The real concern is that in the fire occurring across all our media at the moment, one cannot differentiate between radio, print, broadcasting and, increasingly, digital, which is to say Facebook, Google and others.  The advertising market is combining.  One of the real concerns is that the largest shareholder in INM is also the owner of Communicorp, which has massive radio interests nationally.  As such, I note that it has been widely reported that Mr. Pitt was in a major dispute with his own chairperson in terms of the potential purchase by INM of Newstalk.  There were different views on the valuation of the company.  Can Mr. Pitt confirm that INM was looking to purchase Newstalk and, following a sub-committee process, did not?  It is around the issue of that value where there were significant differences between the management and the chair.  That was widely reported.  A related question is whether INM is still interested or has a potential desire to purchase radio assets as well as the print assets here.  There is real concern about such cross-media ownership.<\/p><p>My next question is to Mr. Mulrennan whose comments were interesting.  I learned something useful in our own deliberations where it was Celtic Media that was approached.  The business was not on the market and a sales process had not been started.  When did INM approach Celtic Media and what was the nature of the approach?  Obviously, Mr. Mulrennan runs a good business.  I take on board what he said about his staff and management.  From everything I hear from local representatives, these are very good titles.  However, it colours our consideration that the business was not for sale.  Someone approached the business seeking to purchase it.  That casts a certain light on what we have to do under the Act.  Our timelines are very tight and one wishes one had more time for deliberations.  When was Celtic Media approached?<\/p><p>Can Mr. Pitt confirm if the reports of significant disputes within INM on the valuation of media were correct?  Was the reporting accurate?  Does INM still have ambitions to purchase other radio stations or media titles as well as the one here today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#N00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486468800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I will answer Deputy Ryan's questions first.

The major part of the question was whether there was any risk to our other printing plants or printing plants in general.  We have no plans at the moment to divest of any other printing plants in Ireland.  Actually, printing plants are quite busy in the evening time at the moment.  It is driven by the daily papers and the slots that one needs to get through them.  The capacity since Royal Avenue closed down means that there is no need for that question for quite a few years.

In Mullingar, we have a very fine competitor in the Topic group.  The owner will not mind me saying we have agreed that we are not really each other's competitors any more but are both in the survival business.<\/p><p>We are both challenged by the decline in advertising and circulation.  Journalists and editors bring it out each week.  It is hammer and tongs between both papers, but it is a survival business for both.  <br\/><br\/>I see that Deputy Shane Cassells is in the Visitors' Gallery.  There is a very fine newspaper going to bed at the moment called <i>Forum<\/i>.  It is a free newspaper in the Dunshaughlin, Ratoath and Ashbourne areas.  We are having serious misgivings over the continued publication of our free newspaper there.  I have already alerted the editor and the sales people involved.  We cannot continue with a loss-making newspaper, so if this sale does not go ahead I would say to Senator Davitt that the huge amount of work that we as a collective - I am talking about the 98 great people in our company - have done, will have been eroded.  Unfortunately - and I say this with due regard to my colleagues - there will be a return to the redundancies that we had to do in 2015.<br\/><br\/>Many years ago, S&eacute;amus Dooley and I worked together in national papers.  I was a member of the NUJ myself for 18 years.  In our own company we got full co-operation from journalists, sales people and right across the board in 2012 and in 2015.  That is because I present to them regularly.  There is never any shortage of information in our company and they know how difficult it is.<br\/><br\/>Senator O'Reilly will know from attending business and sports awards where I speak, that I steal a little bit from Carlsberg.  I say that the <i>Anglo-Celt <\/i>is probably the best local newspaper in the country.  I thank the Senator for his comments about it.  I can confirm that the <i>Anglo-Celt<\/i>will continue to be published from Station House.  Under the sale transaction with INM, the newspaper will effectively become a tenant of Station House when it is sold.  I am not used to divulging commercially sensitive information because we are a small company.  We run our own gig with all due respects, but I have told the committee that Station House is being sold to pay a bridging loan.  I can be no more honest than that.<br\/><br\/>The editor of the <i>Anglo-Celt<\/i>, Linda O'Reilly, is busily putting her paper to bed.  As regards editorial control, in the ten years I have worked with Linda, I have never interfered or dictated what should be in the <i>Anglo-Celt<\/i>.  Senator O'Reilly knows the reason why.  I do not live in Cavan and, truth be told, I do not really know the Cavan issues.  I might be a former journalist, but the business of running that newspaper editorially is that of the editor. <br\/><br\/>As regards jobs in the <i>Anglo-Celt<\/i>, the committee has heard the guarantees.  There are 14 employees in the <i>Anglo-Celt<\/i>, which are all either involved in news generation in our newsroom - and we have terrific journalists there - or in advertising sales.  As a former journalist I used to think that was the commercial, crass side of the business, but without advertising sales there would be no business.<br\/><br\/>To take Deputy Eamon Ryan's question, Dublin is a small city and Ireland is a small country.  We went through a painful redundancy process in 2015, which was particularly painful for those colleagues who lost their jobs.  I dealt with each of those individually because I genuinely care about the jobs of the people who are leaving and of those who are staying in our company.  Yes, we were approached by INM but it did not take a genius to realise that even though Celtic Media is a very well run company, we are in an industry which is seriously challenged.  An approach was made and it was dealt with very efficiently.  Robert Pitt is a gentleman to deal with and what more can I say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#N01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Mulrennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>When was that approach made?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#O00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486468800,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I think it was in April 2016.

Of course he is going to be challenged by a giant of this nature.  At the beginning, somebody made the point that this forum is not about the business model which is at stake here, but rather about examining the plurality of the media and the role of this committee in protecting the interests of the media within our democracy.  Nevertheless, I do think that Mr. Mulrennan has failed to prove to us that his business model is a basket case, as S&eacute;amus Dooley said.  Mr. Mulrennan may feel he is under threat in future, but if it was a basket case why would INM be interested in purchasing it and taking it over?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Mulrennan also mentioned that there is considerable noise about this takeover.  I am glad there is because one of the academics pointed out to us that between 1995 and 2008 there have been 90 mergers in the media with no scrutiny.  It is therefore about time that the people who are elected to protect democracy scrutinised these mergers and looked at what is going on.

At any point during Professor Kenny's own career, was he conflicted by the ownership of the media outlet that he worked for, in terms of stuff that he wanted to write, say or edit?  If he does not want to answer that is fine, but was there any challenge to him in his career by the ownership of the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>or anybody within that group?<\/p><p>We should be looking at everything to do with the plurality of the media here today.  In some cases, there are so many fingers in so many pies that there is bound to be a conflict of interest.  If I was a journalist and, for example, I was worried about the activities of Siteserv within the creation of Irish Water and their role within that, and I wanted to write something about it and I worked for certain outlets, I might be very concerned.  I might ask myself: &quot;Do I want to travel up the structure in this media outlet?  If I do, am I able to make these criticisms?&quot;  I would like the academics to comment on that point.<\/p><p>On the substantive issue, Independent News and Media is being seen as the saviour of the Celtic Media group.  I absolutely believe Mr. Mulrennan and Mr. Tadhg Carey whom I know from the past.  I know they are really concerned about the workforce and workers' conditions, so they should be really concerned that their workers are going to be taken over by that group.<\/p><p>I am concerned they will be taken over by a group which will savage the pension entitlements of workers by reducing them by 70%, bringing pensions down to an unlivable scale within a matter of a couple of years.  Is there not extreme concern that it will, in turn, savage the workers' rights and entitlements within that context?  If Celtic Media thinks local media is threatened by the proliferation of advertising moving to digital and social media, how does it think Independent News and Media will guarantee its long-term survival?  It seems to me the move by Independent News and Media to take over Celtic Media is to allow it to start returning dividends to some of its owners.  Some of the richest people on the planet want more dividends from media ownership in this country.  It is not just about avoiding more losses; it is also returning more profits.  I would like a comment on that and also a comment from the National Union of Journalists, NUJ.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#O01100","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and call Deputy Lawless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#P00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for making very interesting presentations today.  The whole issue of plurality of media is very interesting and very timely as is the debate we are having.  I think the world stands at a new juncture in terms of how we consume and disseminate news, fake news and these kinds of phenomena.  It is all the more important we have this debate and that independent quality journalism is respected and supported.  I also note that one of the academic witnesses made a comment, which I thought was very interesting and relevant, that the press is no longer just a check on government but a check on public, private and corporate interests.<\/p><p>To summarise the debate, we heard the editorial and academic view against the merger and the raising of concerns.  We also heard commercial arguments presented in favour of it.  It strikes me as both a marriage of convenience but also a loveless romance.  In fact, there is an air of the Shakespearean tragedy if I can say that Celtic Media is the poor hapless Juliet and the all powerful INM is Romeo but perhaps that is only in the absence of any other suitor, rather than falling for Romeo in this case.  I  would like to put two questions to Mr. Mulrennan.  My colleague, Senator Davitt, asked whether there would be job cuts or potentially media title closures if the merger did not go ahead but I want to ask that question in the context of the merger going ahead.  Will there be job cuts or potentially media title closures if the merger does not go ahead or if it goes ahead?  I would be very interested in that.<\/p><p>My remaining questions and comments are directed to Mr. Pitt.  He is ultimately the man at the top of the tree if this all goes ahead.  I think it is fair to say that we can predict the future best by studying the past and in that context it is informative to look at INM to date and the operation of the four titles under its remit, certainly the four national titles.  Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley of the NUJ has mentioned the outsourcing of INM production to Yorkshire.  It is also a concern.  In terms of the four titles, the<i>Irish Independent<\/i>, the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>, the <i>Sunday World<\/i>and <i>The Herald<\/i>, what kind of cutbacks have been experienced at those newspapers to date?  What kind of operational management is there for resources and spread of resources?  Is there overlap of resources between titles?  Does this make it more difficult to get a newspaper out every day?  Has quality suffered as a result of this and how is that management chain working out in terms of resources as opposed to the product, which ultimately is independent quality journalism?  Is that coming under threat, even within the existing titles?<\/p><p>I ask Mr. Pitt not to take any offence at this but I listened to the other witnesses and I know a bit about his background.  It struck me that he is the only man who is not a newspaper man as such, certainly among the witnesses.  His background, as I understand, is in discount retail.  I know there is a certain pile them high and sell them cheap approach in that type of business, which I would suggest is probably not the same as the media world.  I notice that Mr. Pitt's comments were very much commercial in nature when he talked about the merger.  As a CEO, that is par for the course and is expected.  I would just stress the point and ask how he reconciles that with the needs of this type of business, which is much more than a business and is a standard bearer for democracy.<\/p><p>In terms of the merger and this not being a commercial product but something so much more than that, how will editorial independence be guaranteed?  What scope will there be for editorial control in local publications?  I mean that both in terms of management intention and direction but also in terms of resources.  Will we see a situation where the editorial clusters?  For example, some titles will pool.  Mr. Mulrennan already spoke about some titles having one editor over two or three publications.  I have seen that happen.  As a practising politician, I deal with local newspapers all the time.  I do not think that model works as it dilutes the proximity to the ground, which is so important for a local publication, so there are huge concerns around that.<\/p><p>Local newspapers are paramount and are very important to their local communities, as Mr. Mulrennan and Mr. Carey have very eloquently put it.  This kind of cost-cutting approach, including supply chain procurement and logistical management, is a different type of world from the world of local independent newspapers and I ask how those items would be reconciled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#P00300","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

INM has no local titles in our areas.  That was one of the factors that very much impressed the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  Therefore, INM titles did not make life in any way difficult for us.  In fact, through Local Ireland, which is the representative body, we are very supportive of each other in terms of marketing the strength of a local newspaper brand.  INM sits on that along with landmark and iconic newspapers, including the <i>Tuam Herald<\/i>and <i>The Nenagh Guardian<\/i>, and ourselves.  There are strengths to it.  There is tremendous loyalty.  The Deputy may have heard about a newspaper that goes back to 1846.  There is tremendous brand strength but the business dynamic is seriously challenged.<br\/><br\/>INM has not been our problem.  RTE is a bigger problem, in truth.  This committee often deals with broadcasting and communications.  We are finding it awfully hard to make any sort of money from digital because of, for example, a State-subsidised website.  The <i>Westmeath Independent<\/i>has terrific web traffic for the relatively small newspaper it is.  The <i>Meath Chronicle<\/i>has probably one of the best trafficked websites and Facebook reach of any newspaper in the country but it is so hard to make money from them because we are competing against Facebook and Google and possibly RTE.<br\/><br\/>Is it a basket case?  Those were not my words but that the business model is broken.  I have a responsibility to do whatever I can to rebuild that business model and to secure the jobs of the people I work with.  A two thirds decline in advertising and a one third decline in circulation is a huge pressure.  They are our only two cogent sources of revenue because digital is not a great source of revenue.  It is a cost.  I regret the fact that since January, we have halved our investment in digital.  Mr. Carey is actively annoyed with me for that but we have to pull in our cost reins.  The longer this sale goes on, the more things like that I am going to have to do.<br\/><br\/>I was asked why INM would want to acquire, which is a horrible word, or get involved with Celtic Media newspapers if it is a challenged business model.  The only future for newspapers in this country is through us aggregating our digital strengths.  That is going to take investment.  In many ways, yes, we have great brands.  The <i>Westmeath Examiner<\/i>goes back to 1882.  <i>The Anglo-Celt<\/i>goes back to 1846.  The <i>Connaught Telegraph<\/i>, a newspaper we bought out of liquidation in 2014, when we saved 12 jobs, goes back to 1828.  This is not Romeo and Juliet stuff, with respect.  This is cold commercial reality.<\/p><p>Independent News and Media needs to extend a digital footprint, which is very important because we need resources to invest in digital services.  We also need marketing resources because we are not spending on marketing.  We have great brands but we are not spending on them.  Far from being a Romeo and Juliet story, this is a matter of survival.  <\/p><p> On the issue of pensions, which was raised by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, there is no pension issue in the Celtic Media Group or Celtic Media Newspapers.  A defined contribution scheme has been in place in the company for a number of years.  Pension schemes are challenged from time to time but we are far removed from the other issues that have been raised.  We have our own pension scheme in place.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Mulrennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":147,"content":"<p>With respect, I will clarify what I meant in my question.

The way we produce newspapers will change and we will have to consolidate many of the back office functions.  These functions do not influence the tone or editorial voice of a newspaper and it was these that moved to York following our decision.  Unfortunately, there is no similar facility in Ireland to which we could have moved.  If there had been such a facility, we would have given it serious consideration and if such a facility were to open here, we would like to have these jobs back in Ireland.  As I pointed out, INM employs 800 people, all of whom are located on the island of Ireland, and all of our business is on the island of Ireland.  We are an Irish business.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith described Independent News and Media as a &quot;giant&quot;.  INM is very small compared with other media businesses operating in this country, for example, News UK and Daily Mail and General Trust, DMGT.  We do our best to fight our corner and ensure there is a strong Irish voice in the Irish media.  This sometimes means taking difficult decisions but that is the job with which I am charged and a challenge I need to face.  <br\/><br\/>Deputy Lawless asked me a question on my background in retail.  I am very proud to have worked in retail for Lidl and Tesco.  I worked with diligent, hard-working people who care in retail and, to be honest, I found very similar people in my current company.  What we in retail bring is not only expertise in supply chain and cost-cutting but a focus on the customer or, in the case of newspapers, the reader.  One can do this by asking how we can make people buy more newspapers.  If one looks at the performance of INM newspapers, we are beating market trends, outperforming others and doing very well.<br\/><br\/>I also brought a sense of realism to where we are.  The deal under which we print newspapers in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>owned printing plant and <i>The Irish Times<\/i>allows us to distribute its newspaper was of mutual benefit and an example of people being very practical.  There are major questions facing the newspaper industry and we need to figure out how to ensure we still have newspapers in ten or 15 years time.  We can and will do this if we are all pragmatic about how we protect the quality of newspapers and if we ensure they remain independent and their content is relevant.  The most important issue is that if newspapers are not relevant and the content is not trusted, people will stop buying them, which will hasten the current trends.  I believe my previous experience has brought something to this. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Pitt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486468800,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I will answer Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's questions and address a sideswipe that was made at the experts by another member.  Deputy Smith asked about pressures in news organisations.  It is absolutely correct that there are pressures in every news organisation.  Deputy Stanley put it best when he stated we know that he who pays the piper calls the tune.  Every day, journalists come across all kinds of pressures.  They face the pressure of threatened legal action, which is a real difficulty in Ireland when it comes to telling the truth, and there are also pressures from owners and ideological pressures.  Over the years, I have written for the <i>Irish Press <\/i>Group, the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>and <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and I have worked in RTE.  There are constant pressures, which is precisely the reason committees such as this one need to fight to protect the media and media diversity and plurality and make media places where we can hear different voices.<br\/><br\/>Before he left the meeting, Deputy Michael Lowry stated it was all very well for the experts.  We know what that phrase means; it means experts are not realistic and are academics with their heads in the clouds.  There is nothing more realistic than the issues of diversity and plurality in the media.  These issues have an economic value to the country.  If a country does not have free, vibrant and authentic media, people will not hear the stories that need to be told, whether they are about the banking crisis or the issues that gave rise to the Moriarty tribunal.  The reason one needs diverse and plural media is that this is of real economic benefit.<br\/><br\/>With due respect, Senator Terry Leyden is here to ask about more issues than he seems to believe because that is what the Act requires.  Under the Act, the indicators of plurality are set out in a formal notification on mergers and acquisitions pursuant to Part 3A of the Competition Act, as amended.  The guidelines make clear that these issues must be addressed.<br\/><br\/>I have absolute sympathy with Celtic Media and its employees.  My colleagues and I know the economic realities of the workplace.  We have seen students leaving the country because there are no jobs here and we see others entering employment with precarious working conditions in which they are exploited, an issue about which Deputy Stanley spoke.  When working conditions are such that people do not receive proper contracts from organisations such as INM and other media organisations, including RTE, they cannot feel free to do they type of things members want them to do.  This is the reality for working people, not a theory.  Having a gun held to one's head and being told to agree to this merger or jobs will be lost is a very real consideration.  However, other considerations must also be taken into account, which is the reason we have competition regulation and media mergers legislation.  These are just as real, concrete and authentic as other considerations, which is the reason the European Union refers to concrete indicators of plurality.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Colum Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>A long time ago, in 1982, Professor Kenny gave me assistance on the media and I respect what he is saying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#Q00600","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>The Senator must be brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#Q00700","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>My point, however, is that he and his colleagues have secure pensions and jobs.

I am very glad he brought it back to the quality of jobs.  This cannot be a last-man-standing argument.  One must enjoy working in a newspaper; it is a vocation as can be seen particularly with the journalists who write for a newspaper.  Professor Kenny said it is difficult for young people to come into this industry.  We hired 12 graduates, fully paid, on a two-year programme and they are still with INM at the moment.  That was a huge investment in a very distressed business.  That is because we understand the need for a pipeline of young people who want to work in newspapers, who want to write copy, who want to take photographs and so forth.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Professor Kenny on the challenges the industry faces.  We are trying to address them and create quality jobs.  We improved the maternity benefits for people in INM from three weeks to 24 weeks last year to better allow people with a young family to be able to continue their career.  This is alongside all the other things we do in terms of reorganising the business.  Some of them can seem harsh, but they are decisions that somebody has to take and I will take those decisions.  However, we cannot sacrifice quality, which, as I understand from my retail experience, is paramount.  We have to provide something that people want to buy or transact with; and we have that in INM.  Of course, when we make changes to how we produce a newspaper and make changes to the volumes of content, we have to make some kind of value decision based on what the person gets and so forth.  We, in INM, have been very balanced on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#R00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Pitt"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Carey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#R00800","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>What about my question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#R00900","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Sorry.

The Senator is correct that informing people of those key elements of local democracy is a crucial part of the make-up and future of local journalism.  Having said that, with the reduced number of journalists available to editors - I am sure every editor will empathise with this - there are always tough choices to be made in the allocation of staff and deciding the events to cover.  Courts and local government represent a key element of any respectable local newspaper.<br\/><br\/>I will give a sense of the challenges that face me in a practical sense in my local area.  The <i>Westmeath Independent<\/i>is based in Athlone.  As members will know, Athlone is a split town between Westmeath and Roscommon.  Offaly is six miles away with Longford about eight miles away.  We also circulate in Ballinasloe in County Galway.  That is a fairly diverse territory for coverage of local authorities.  The fragmentation of the local government system can be added into the mix.  Nowadays we have county councils, municipal districts, strategic policy committees etc.  I do not need to tell members about those; they are well aware of those demands on their colleagues on the local authorities.  That, obviously, increases the demands on local newspapers.<br\/><br\/>Our readers consume increasing amounts of content on mobile phones and laptops and they want that content provided instantaneously or at least as quickly as possible.  That is another challenge to add into the mix.  One of the most successful digital offerings in which my newspaper was involved was the coverage of a controversy over an installation in an art gallery in Athlone.  We covered a meeting through Twitter and Facebook and we had a huge audience.  We need to do more of that sort of thing.  That is why the digital strength that INM can give to us is important to me, as an editor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017020700002#R01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tadhg Carey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486468800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I wish to make a comment based on listening to the contributions this afternoon.

To many, the methodology behind NewERA and the failure to meet the EUROSTAT test undermined the whole concept behind and reason for the establishment of the water charging system.  It would appear that passing the test is not now possible.  I am conscious of the recommendations of the expert commissions and some questions emanating from that in respect of borrowings.  What is the current borrowing cost of Irish Water in comparison to ten-year Government bonds?  I ask this because, at present, I believe borrowing is done on a yearly basis.  Is that correct?<\/p> <p>  If the State is to become the sole customer of domestic water tariffs, is it feasible to borrow on the markets whether it be by Irish Water or its parent company, Ervia, thereafter?  Has Irish Water undertaken an analysis of this shift, as proposed by the expert commission report?  It was published some time ago and I am sure there has been some consideration of the recommendations contained in it.  It would be interesting to hear at this juncture whether there is any comment from NewERA in respect of this issue.  <\/p> <p>  Some would say that the cessation of water metering was on the cards anyway because we were led to believe that 300,000 properties could not be metered.

It is primarily about the most cost-effective way currently for Irish Water to fund its commercial facilities in the context of the decision by EUROSTAT and in light of the suspension of domestic charges.  The report looked specifically at the cost of current commercial facilities for Irish Water, which are on a one-year basis, and compared it with what the State is funding on a one-year basis.  Based on an interest rate of 1.4% for Irish Water and -0.4% for the State, we would calculate that this amounts to an interest rate saving of about &euro;14 million for the State so that is the primary context for the report.<\/p><p> On longer term funding rates for the State, Irish Water is not funding long term.

One of the reasons it gave a negative reading to the first application for the market corporation test was that there was a mismatch in the relationship between the revenue generated by the cost of domestic charges and the borrowing requirements in the plan for the capital investment programme.  The consequence of that is that in order to get to an off-balance sheet position by 2018 or 2019 a higher rate or projection of a future higher rate of domestic water charges would be required.  Is that the witnesses' understanding or interpretation of that bit of the market corporation test failure?<\/p> <p>  The capital projections for Irish Water sit around &euro;500 million until 2019, but from 2019 to 2021 they increase significantly to between &euro;770 million to around &euro;900 million each year.

Obviously, budgetary arithmetic is done on an annual basis and certainty of funding - a phrase to which we always come back - is one of the issues that concerns funding models.  I would have pointed to that when first before the committee.  In terms of examining scenarios and revenue streams that may come from an excess charge, this will depend on where it is set and the objective to be achieved.  For instance, the plastic bag levy is an environmental charge that is designed to change behaviour.  It is not intended to be a sustainable revenue source over the long term.  This will be something that causes people to adapt their behaviour in order to conserve water and which will also have an impact on production costs over the long term.

We all have our views on what constitutes excessive usage.  I appreciate the Commission for Energy Regulation will be tasked with setting the figure.  The witnesses specifically referred in their submission to the importance of a dissuasive argument for those who are prone to wasting water, or even to determine whether people are wasting water.  What are the views of the witnesses on the level at which this should be set?<\/p> <p>  We have a very obvious question of fairness, particularly to those who provide their own water supply, such as group water schemes throughout the country.  They provide a significant saving to the Exchequer.  In the long term, it is most likely cheaper for them to provide the water supply to their communities than for the State to do so in certain instances.  Otherwise, I would argue, group water schemes would not exist.  How do we square this circle?  How do we deal with the basic inequality we will have if the current arrangement is adopted through the expert report, with regard to people paying for excessive usage versus those in private group schemes who will pay a charge regardless?  I understand there is State subvention, and this has been restored as of the suspension date to 2015 levels.  I know the witnesses are calling for additional subsidies, and it is in the report which is helpful no doubt to group water schemes.  What are the views of the witnesses on this?<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe it is possible for private group schemes to provide the service the State provides in housing estates throughout the country cheaper than the State provides it?  Do they have a view on how this would be achieved?  I am sure they can appreciate we have spoken to the commission, Irish Water, NewERA and departmental officials on numerous occasions in recent years, where the total cost of the provision of the water and the wastewater networks throughout the State has been highlighted.  All the while, hundreds of thousands of people already pay for water and their local community water services.  With very few exceptions, certainly in the advice with which we have been provided, I have seen examples of excellence in the service provided by group water schemes, no more than by State providers.<\/p><p>Do the witnesses have a view on the ongoing sustainability of the group schemes they represent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020700002#R00200","speaker":"1300","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486468800,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I will deal first with the second issue on fairness and equity.  I presume the Deputy is talking about Irish Water and other service providers versus the group water scheme sector.  As mentioned in our submission, since the late 1990s when domestic water charges were abandoned on the public water supplies, the group water scheme sector has been getting a subvention towards the cost of supply and treatment of domestic water services.  That has been in place since then.  Group water schemes come together as a group, assess their own individual overall costs, assess what they can get through the subsidy and then agree among themselves as a group with the leadership of the committee of management or board of directors as to what they are prepared to contribute directly towards the costs of their group water supply scheme.<\/p> <p>  That subsidy has been reviewed a number of times since then.  We have a partnership arrangement with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, as it was, and now the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  We review that on behalf of the schemes with that Department.  In all instances we have had a good relationship with the Department and found that it takes our views on costs into account.  That review has always been an upward review, apart from the time when domestic water charges were reintroduced when we had a reduction in that subsidy.<\/p> <p>  Irrespective of what comes out of this process, whether it be a charge based on excessive usage, a charge that is based on a charge that is there currently but suspended, or no charge at all, we would expect to sit down with the Department.  We have received assurances from the Department, and I am sure all the people here would give us the same assurances, as to what this committee would recommend.<\/p> <p>  We have been given assurances that we will get a review of that subsidy and that situation.  We have flagged, and we always would flag, additional charges that have arisen since the previous review in 2008.  We refer to some of those charges here and we would expect those additional costs to be taken into account in any review.  The equity arises in the operation and maintenance cost.  We would expect that equity would continue to apply through that process.<\/p> <p>  Group water schemes have been getting capital grants towards the capital costs of new group water schemes and upgrading old group water schemes.  The old group water schemes I am talking about in were installed in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.  Those group water schemes were effectively in a mess in the late 1990s and were the subject of a European Court of Justice case.  There had always been grants for the group water scheme sector, but at that stage the grants were significantly increased.  A serious amount of work was done under that rural water programme, as it was, again in partnership with the Department and local authorities through the national rural water services committee.  That work has been done.<\/p> <p>  Without fear of contradiction, I can say that at this stage the group water scheme sector, through that grant aid process, is probably in a better position from an infrastructural point of view than Irish Water.  All the reports we have seen to date indicate that Irish Water is in need of serious investment in order to bring its infrastructure up to date.  We are ahead of the posse there and have achieved that through that grant aid.  We would expect that grant aid to continue through the process if that level of support is there for Irish Water and its capital costs.<\/p> <p>  Group water schemes contribute towards the initial capital costs and the capital costs of any improvements and replacement infrastructure.  It is a programme that is very focused on getting value for money and only replacing infrastructure where it is needed.  Around all that, through that rural water programme, the whole area of metering came into play big time.<\/p><p> Group water scheme committees of management would have been iffy about metering in the beginning.  Through the process of metering, and I mean individual meters for tens of thousands of members across hundreds of group water schemes right around the country, it immediately became very evident that most or at least a very high proportion of the excessive usage or leakage, whatever we want to call it, was on the consumer side of the meter, particularly when the contribution mechanism based on volume of usage came in.  Through that, the usage and demand came down.  The amount of infrastructure required also came down, such as reservoir storage.  There were instances where projects for planned reservoirs could be abandoned because of the reduction in usage.  That was one of the savings.  There was a saving for operational maintenance costs since the more water put through a system, the more maintenance required.  That has come about through all that.  Group schemes would say, without contradiction, that universal metering as a management tool and as a water conservation tool on their group water schemes, combined with a reasonable charge on usage over and above a free allowance, has been the single driving force behind the overall transformation of the sector.<\/p><p> I will address excessive usage and what it constitutes.  Our research on the group water scheme sector, and we can only deal with the thousands of members on group water schemes that we talk about, shows that the average usage of a household would range from about 120 cu. m to 150 cu. m per annum.  That would be based on metered usage in the context of a metered water charge over a particular free allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020700002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt Mr. Brady.

It is actually 20 years ago this month since the co-operative, collaborative approach to subsidy arrangements was made for group water schemes.

It was most impressive and useful.  The main recommendation of the Expert Commission on Domestic Public Water Services and the duty of this committee thereafter is to find a funding mechanism to deal with the implementation of that.  In recommending that the State become the main customer for provision of domestic use, it also, to inform Deputy Farrell, recommends and asks that we seek greater parity and equality for those who fund that from their own resources in addition to State help and assistance.  That point has to be made.  It is our duty and what we want to do.  We want to get some information from the witnesses that allows us to be in a position to make a recommendation that can close that gap.  It has not been closed in recent years, I would add.<\/p> <p>  I have some specific questions to help to do that.  Has the National Federation of Group Water Schemes calculated the estimated cost per household of a group water scheme bill?  In other words, what is the average bill throughout the country?  Has it calculated that and can it be made available to the committee?  How much would complete subsidisation of group water schemes cost per annum, to equalise completely with the public provision?  What is the current average subsidy per group scheme from the State?  How does that equate to the customer, the end user?<\/p><p>In other words, what is the average subsidisation in respect of each user?  We will end up with subsidisation if we proceed along the road in respect of public supply and we did not compare that with existing subsidisation of the rural sector so that we can seek to address parity, if necessary.  The agreement we reached with Fine Gael put a pathway in place to deal with this issue and allow the Government to continue to function so as to deal with many other pressing issues, as we saw last night, for example.  Can the witnesses confirm that grant aid was reinstated when we suspended charges?  Did it increase because a commitment was given that it would increase?  As authors of the agreement, we need to know to ensure that what we were seeking at that time, namely, to ensure greater parity and equality, has been achieved.  This committee has a greater responsibility to ensure greater parity and equality in the event of it making a recommendation to the D&aacute;il for its acceptance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020700002#T00600","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486468800,"counter":372,"content":"<p>In respect of the Deputy's final point regarding confirmation that the grant aid has been reinstated, there are two different type of schemes.

In South Dublin County Council, people have to pay i&euro;3,000, &euro;4,000 and, sometimes, &euro;5,000 now.  I would be interested to hear more from Mr. Brady in his detail written response about what kinds of works those capital grants go towards.  What do they cover?  What do they not cover?  This will allow us to try to make a comparison between the capital cost for a household in a group water scheme in rural Ireland versus those in an urban area.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Brady's submission also referred to the reduction in consumption, which in some cases was between 60% and 80%.

Has Mr. Brady any data on that?<\/p> <p>  Some of us in urban areas in Dublin still have group water schemes.  My experience is that some very much like being in group water schemes and do not want that to change.  They want equity and parity in terms of whatever outcome there is for others.  However, I also deal with people in group water schemes who would prefer to be in the public water system.  The difficulty, of course, is that historically the local authority was not able to fund the work, so in a sense they are outside the public water scheme but not by choice.  How reflective are those two experiences of Mr. Brady's affiliates?  Is there a desire among some to retain their current position but, obviously, to improve its funding?

We have worked with Irish Water and the Department, in a partnership way, to develop protocols and procedures in this regard.  Those protocols and procedures are as good as finalised at this stage and work has started on taking over those schemes.

As members will see from the submission from the federation, there is a lot more pipework in a group water scheme per household than there is for households under Irish Water.  Therefore, the measure was essential.  Obviously, the bulk meter did a significant job in identifying sections of main posing a problem.  The tendency in the local group scheme was to believe the system was leaking like a sieve, leading to the view that the pipework should be replaced.  Replacing the pipework would not have actually solved the problem because most of the loss was not in the pipe at all but on the consumer side of the connection.  We could not have identified that without the individual meters.  That explains what we very much tend to favour.

I read <i>Rural Water News<\/i>.  There is a very important editorial in it that is written in bold by the delegates.  I agree with it very much.  It states that to ignore the group water scheme subsidy arrangement introduced originally when public domestic water charges were abolished in the late 1990s leads to a one-sided debate and an unnecessary and unhelpful urban&ndash;rural division on the water issue.  The good news, it states, is that advance payments at the restored subsidy rate were paid out to schemes in mid-December by way of a supplementary payment.  For me, that is very important because there has been an attempt to create an urban&ndash;rural divide, which is not at all helpful.  Those of us who campaigned against water charges did so for everybody.  Is it fair to say the fortunes of those on group water schemes, in terms of the amount they end up paying out of their own pocket, have fluctuated in line with those of people in the public water scheme, albeit not to a point of complete fairness because I do not believe such a point exists?

The other issue in regard to that, and where charges in group water schemes can rise, is that in order to comply with drinking water regulations it is no longer sufficient to operate group water schemes in a voluntary capacity.  There is need for professional, paid management and caretakers to meet these regulations, and we are working with the group water schemes again.  We have a lot of management structures in place.  That is just one of the areas where there might be an increase in costs associated with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020700002#Y00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I would like a bit more time to expand on some of these questions.  Is it true to say that prior to the introduction of the rural water programme the management of group water schemes was quite haphazard and varied significantly from scheme to scheme?  Some schemes had paid staff to actively manage the consumption of the scheme.  Quite a lot of schemes had none.  The figures in regard to consumption and things like that are quite skewed because the first active look at the consumption figures on schemes was in conjunction with the major capital investment under the rural water programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020700002#Y00900","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486468800,"counter":426,"content":"<p>It would have been based on actual consumption on those particular schemes, but I take the point.  Effectively, group water schemes were put in the ground on day one.  They were left to their own devices for the most part, and they were being funded entirely by the members of the group water schemes.  The people operating those schemes did a serious job in the context of the resources and time they had available to them.  It was for the most part a voluntary effort by very good volunteers.  Volunteers can manage group water schemes very effectively.  The point I am making is that the public health issues in the regulations do not allow the schemes to continue in that capacity into the future but there will always be a place for volunteers in group water schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020700002#Y01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I am not disputing the work or doing anything to denigrate the work that people do in a voluntary capacity in group schemes but the point that I am making is that we are not really comparing like with like.  The group water scheme sector has done a huge amount of work in improving the quality and standard of water on their supplies.  With regard the information that we have asked for in regard to the average cost of schemes, it is important for the work of the committee to actually link that to the individual schemes and the type of treatment that is on the scheme.  Many schemes would have simple disinfection whereas other schemes would have quite detailed dissolved air floatation, DAF, machinery which would mean different costs.  It would be useful for the committee if the average costs were actually tied into the type of treatment used in the schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017020700002#Y01100","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1486468800,"counter":428,"content":"<p>That is a very valuable point.
