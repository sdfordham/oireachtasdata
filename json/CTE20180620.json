We will have a presentation this afternoon from representatives of Tusla.  I welcome CEO, Mr. Fred McBride, chief operations officer, Mr. Jim Gibson, director of transformation and policy, Mr. Cormac Quinlan, service director, Dr. Aisling Gillen and service director for Dublin and the mid-Leinster area, Ms Patricia Finlay.  I thank them for coming here this afternoon at short notice.  The committee is also grateful to the witnesses for agreeing to a shorter meeting this afternoon.  I also welcome members and viewers who may be watching these proceedings on Oireachtas TV.<\/p><p>Before we commence and in accordance with procedure, I am required to draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.<\/p><p>They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p> I remind members to switch off their mobile phones - which I forgot to do - because it will interfere with the sound systems.  It affects the ability of the parliamentary reporters to record what people are saying.  It makes it hard for people watching or listening at home to pick up what is being said.<\/p><p> I advise witnesses that submissions or opening statements they have made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  After the presentations, there will be a series of questions from members for approximately one hour and 50 minutes until 4 o'clock.<\/p><p> The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss HIQA's report and the investigation into the management of allegations of child sex abuse against adults of concern by the Child and Family Agency upon the direction of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The report arose from the RT&Eacute; \"Prime Time\" programme which revealed that Tusla had sent notification to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, containing a false allegation of child sex abuse against a Garda whistleblower, Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  In light of these circumstances and concern about more systematic issues that might require a response at national level, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, instructed HIQA to carry out a statutory investigation under the Health Act 2007.  The HIQA board approved this investigation which began in March 2017.<\/p><p> The investigation report was published yesterday and made a number of recommendations to improve safety, quality and standards of services provided by Tusla regarding referrals of allegation of child abuse involving adults of concern.<\/p><p> As Chairman, I take the opportunity to thank HIQA for the speed with which it dealt with this statutory inquiry.  To complete a statutory inquiry into such a large organisation in just under a year is no small feat.  I thank HIQA for its very significant input into the activities of Tusla and the policies surrounding it, underpinned by legislation passed by these Houses.<\/p><p> Before I invite Mr. McBride to make his opening statement, I note for the members the comprehensive document prepared by the secretariat and circulated to them.  If they have an opportunity, they should read it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#A00500","speaker":"1300","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to talk about the HIQA investigation and report.  We acknowledge and welcome the recommendations.  I also welcome HIQA&rsquo;s acknowledgement that there is now clear strategic direction and a long-term vision of what we want to achieve.  HIQA has made it clear and consistently stated both in this report and in other inspection reports that where a concern about a child is expressed to Tusla and we have information to indicate that the child is at immediate risk, the child gets an immediate response and that response is deemed to be protective and keeps them safe or reduces the risk.<\/p> <p>  HIQA also confirmed the consistent finding of Tusla staff advocating strongly for the children and families for whom it works.  They have shown a capacity to maintain good relationships and improve outcomes for children.  Of course, we receive 53,000 referrals a year.  We cannot possibly respond to 53,000 referrals immediately and therefore, of course, a degree of prioritisation must take place.  This HIQA report focuses on those referrals where it is not deemed that children are at immediate risk, how we prioritise these referrals and what action we take on them.<\/p> <p>  It was reassuring for us, albeit a very challenging read in the report, that the investigation report highlights exactly those issues faced by the agency which we had already identified and which we have been proactively addressing, mostly over the past two years.  I know the agency is four years old, but in the first two years we were really just trying to keep services going and it was not until 2016 that additional investment was made available to us - very welcome as it was - that we began to reflect on and analyse the work that needed to be done.  We embarked on a very comprehensive organisational cultural programme and reform.  One of the HIQA external advisers, to whom I spoke the other day, remarked that it was both an ambitious and a radical attempt to change child-protection services, which is what it is.<\/p> <p>  I point out some of the significant progress we have made since Tusla was established.  By 9 July we will have rolled out what we are calling the national childcare information system, an integrated computerised system.  This will mean that for the first time in this country all our 17 functional operational areas will be on one integrated IT system, which we hope will eliminate inconsistencies that previously occurred with a mixture of paper-based systems and a plethora of obsolete and outdated computer systems.<\/p> <p>  As the report acknowledged, we have been developing many interagency protocols to assist in working with key partners, particularly in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE.  The report also highlights, particularly in the governance review, that interagency and collaborative working was a consistent strength of Tusla, with many examples of children being safer as a result.<\/p> <p>  We have also invested considerable time and money in what we call our prevention, partnership and family-support programme, which supports families in their local communities with initiatives such as Parenting 24-7 and Meitheal.  We have developed the child protection notification system so that for children who are subject to a child protection plan there is live and accessible information available on a multiagency basis which the Garda, medical staff and accident and emergency units can access across the country.  In another first for the country, we now have an out-of-hours service that covers the whole country rather than just Dublin and Cork.<\/p> <p>  Despite that progress, I absolutely agree that there are inconsistencies in our system and in our response to referrals where a child is not identified as being at immediate risk, as highlighted by HIQA.  We are actively addressing this through our new national approach to practice.  The last time the members of the committee visited us in the Brunel building, they had an opportunity to see some of the detail of that national approach to practice, which we are callings Signs of Safety.  We are confident this will bring a consistency throughout the country so that children and families receive a consistent, timely and proportionate response.<\/p> <p>  We also accept HIQA's findings that we need to further improve our governance and accountability arrangements.  Some further key posts are required in that regard.  Accountability is about identifying problems and taking responsibility for these problems, understanding their causes and putting in place actions to remedy these.  That is exactly what we have been doing for the past two and a half years in particular, but also before that.<\/p> <p>  The agency is accountable to a board and, as I emphasised at the press conference yesterday, staff are held to account in a proportionate and fair way through robust HR procedures.<\/p> <p>  I wish to speak about the legislative context and we may get a chance to discuss it in more detail.  In particular I refer to the legislative context concerning retrospective and historical allegations of abuse.  That is where an adult comes forward now to say that something happened to them as a child.  We have been thrust into a space by case law, which places a responsibility on us to balance fair and due process for the person against whom the allegation has been made on the one hand and on the other hand trying to make an assessment of the risk to children now and what we need to do about that.  There are significant legal constraints around that and we may get an opportunity to explore some of that in more detail today.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, in the past two years we have reduced the number of unallocated retrospective allegations by approximately 60% which, by any industry standard, is a pretty reasonable improvement.  The pace of change has been rapid and I accept the Minister's supportive comments about what we have achieved so far.  We need to increase the pace of change and we look forward to the discussion with the oversight group the Minister intends to set up on how that increase in pace might be achieved.<\/p><p> We accept the recommendations that HIQA set out and see them as an endorsement of our programme of reform.  We undoubtedly have some way to go but we are actively addressing all the issues to ensure practice across the country is consistent and of a high quality in order that we can provide a timely, proportionate and appropriate response to children and families.  We acknowledge that quality is variable at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred McBride","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>As we have a substantial amount of time, I propose to allocate ten minutes to each member for questions and responses.

There is always a degree of unknown elements with 53,000 referrals a year.  Almost all of them - 98% or 99% - are screened, although they do not all move to an initial assessment.  Somebody looks a referral and decides whether immediate action needs to be taken.  HIQA acknowledges that, from the evidence it looked at, no child who needs an immediate response does not get one.  That is consistent with what we know ourselves because we respond immediately to children who are at immediate risk or in harm's way.  We monitor the cases which are waiting to be allocated and where the circumstances change, we look for any new information that comes in on these cases.  It is entirely possible that a child could be in harm's way without us knowing.  In the case of more than one third of unallocated cases, I would not even call them \"unallocated\" because they are being actively worked by our duty and intake teams.  It is simply that they do not have a single, dedicated social worker attached to them.  I realise and accept that having a duty team working cases is not ideal but I do not think it means they are unallocated.  That is a debatable point and I do not suggest I am absolutely correct in this regard but I am trying to provide nuance in this respect.<\/p> <p>  Other cases are monitored by the duty team and when there is any new information suggesting a case be given a higher priority, we do that.  We contact schools, we may visit a child at home and we talk to people in the community.  Can we always know there are no risks to children?  I am sorry but we cannot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred McBride"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>It is important to outline our service delivery design.  Before the agency was established, it was quite common for a community care area to have four or five points of contact to refer a matter relating to a child.  Within our service delivery framework, we now have dedicated contact points in each functional area of the Child and Family Agency.  As for the percentage split of referrals to the agency, 60% are for child welfare or children in need cases and 40% are child protection cases.<\/p> <p>  The system has become more sophisticated.  The HIQA investigative report was a point in time.  We have mentioned the prevention, partnership and family support, PPFS, programme.  In each area, we have a team that reads, evaluates and directs referrals.  For example, 1,300 staff and other members in the non-government sector have been trained in the Meitheal programme and there have been 1,409 requests.  There are 99 family support networks across Ireland that pick up and help families in need and early intervention and support such as this ensures these cases do not materialise as serious child protection concerns.<\/p> <p>  Some 28,500 children in Ireland have received a family support service and we are ramping the service up.  Every report and inquiry in Ireland concluded there was a dearth of family support services and early intervention programmes and we have worked exceptionally hard and tirelessly since our establishment, with the collaboration of Atlantic Philanthropies, which put &euro;10 million on the table for us, and with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and NUI Galway to develop this side of our business.  A research report will be provided in September, which will show the results of this work and really good outcomes for children in Ireland.  There are 53,000 referrals and they are not just about child protection but are about child welfare as well.  We try to get in early to resolve problems to support families and children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gibson"},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I am utterly disillusioned after reading yesterday's report.

They used to be national panels run by the national recruitment service of the HSE.  For the first two years, we were entirely dependent on that system for recruitment.  I am absolutely clear it did not and does not meet our purposes or needs.  It is not quick enough and is too bureaucratic and inflexible.  Over the past two years, we have attempted to take back some degree of control at least over that process by setting up our own Tusla recruiting capacity.  Recently, we have taken back the social work panels from the national recruitment service and have set up regional arrangements for recruitment.<\/p> <p>  We have also been in touch with third level institutions and we have a third level liaison group.  Through universities and colleges, we are trying to promote Tusla as an employer of choice and ensure people get the support they need when they come to work.  We are trying to work with universities to ensure new graduates are as ready as they can be for the practice, albeit that everybody will need some support in his or her first two years.  I have also personally been to recruitment events outside Ireland trying to recruit social workers, particularly from the North and the UK.  Those are some of the actions we have taken.<\/p> <p>  We have also been looking at a retention strategy and we have been recruiting in large numbers.  The problem has been keeping hold of staff, to be frank.  We are looking at other measures, such as creating a senior practitioner grade, to try to encourage people to stay in practice.  Currently, career development often means moving into management and we want to give opportunities to people to stay in practice and be rewarded and recognised for their experience.  The turnover of social workers in the Republic of Ireland is 8.8% and in the UK it is 15%.  We have real problems but comparatively speaking, it is not quite as bad as other places.  We really need to work further on that in order to support people in doing this work.  We want people coming to Tusla who really want to do the work.  We cannot have people coming in because they need a job and would rather be working in the mental health, disability or probation areas.  I do not want that and we do not need cases where people stay for a short period and leave.  We need people who are dedicated to this area of social work and who really want to work with us and be supported.<\/p> <p>  We are also looking at our skills mix and we will have a workforce plan ready in the autumn that will describe the sort of mix we think we require.  It is not just all about social workers, as important as they are, particularly in the area of child sexual abuse.  We need qualified social workers to do that work.  Their work can be supported and supplemented by social care workers, family support workers and our very valuable administrative and clerical staff in order to free social workers to do what they need to.  That work is in train.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred McBride"},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Is morale low among social workers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#D00300","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred McBride"},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>It does not feed into the retention issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#D00500","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>No.  Members may wish to look at a recent survey done by Dr. Andrew Turnell, who is working with us on our Signs of Safety approach, and which had a reasonable return rate.

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also interviewed the child a number of times but the Director of Public Prosecutions did not proceed with prosecution.  The care order was granted and a UK forensic psychologist examined all the DVDs of these interviews and gave evidence on the grounds of credibility.

We appreciate it.  They have acknowledged the systemic failures that exist within Tusla as an organisation.  I do not intend it to be personal when I say that the people at the top of Tusla need to have a cold, hard look at the organisation based on this report.  Perhaps they are doing that.  It is too bad that we hear about the various instances that occur so regularly.  When we, as legislators, are discussing this matter with the witnesses today, we are seeking answers to our questions in order that the public can be somewhat reassured that the most vulnerable children in the State are being looked out for.  Is there a problem with the skills mix that needs to be resolved?  What can the witnesses say to reassure those who are tuning into today's proceedings?  Mr. McBride said at the outset that a child could be in harm's way without the knowledge of Tusla.  I accept that this can happen but I suggest that such cases should be exceptional.  Is that too much for us to expect from the organisation?  I understand why Mr. McBride wants to be realistic about what people can expect.

We can only know about what we find out about, what we are told about, what we see and what we observe.  There are children at risk in many families and situations in Ireland and Tusla and other State agencies do not necessarily know about them.  Sexual abuse, by its very nature, happens behind closed doors.  There are efforts within families and other extended networks to keep it secret.  I have to say that realistically, we cannot know about everything.  As HIQA has reported, when these matters come to our attention and we think there is an immediate risk or a child is immediately in harm's way, we respond immediately and we do something about it.  This report is about how we prioritise our response to cases involving children who are not at immediate risk and how we make sure that response is appropriate, sufficiently timely and proportionate.  While we should not overreact to something, equally seriously we should not under-react.  That is the best way I can answer the Senator's question.  I am trying to be honest and realistic.

As we said earlier, we receive 53,000 referrals each year.  We have 24,366 open cases in which there is a concern that children may be at risk.  I mention that to give the committee an idea of the volume of work we are doing.  As we have communicated on a regular basis, the unallocated cases represent the big concern for us as an agency.  It has been mentioned that the number of such cases has been driven down by 51% since 2014.  We recognise that approximately 4,700 cases are unallocated.  In some of those cases, we must try to define what the concern for the referral is.  It is really clear for our business.  If we get a referral about a child who will not wear his coat to school during the winter and his mother is really struggling with that, and at the same time, we get a referral about a young girl who has disclosed to her teacher that her father entered her bedroom and acted in a sexually inappropriate way, we will deal with the latter referral there and then.  We will sort that situation out there and then.  There are many referrals on our system in cases like that of the child who will not wear his coat.  As part of our national approach to practice, we are looking at such cases and drilling down into them.  As I said earlier when I was speaking about the prevention, partnership and family support programme, there is a place and a pathway for those children to go to.  We will look at the child who is not wearing a coat at some stage but not on the day on which the referral is received because our resources are finite.  We will deploy them where children are most at risk.

Systemic issues have been mentioned with particular reference to the screening exercise.  Screening has two main goals.  When we get a referral, we have to gather information, analyse it quickly and make a judgment on what we should do in respect of the matter.  Obviously, we check what information we already hold in respect of that family.  That is the task of screening.  One of the most important goals of screening is to identify children who are at immediate risk at that point in time and to respond to that.  It is stated clearly in the HIQA report and every other inspection report that we do this consistently well all of the time.  Beyond that, we look at what response is needed in other cases and how we prioritise those cases.  In 2015, when we reviewed our system to identify the problems with regard to screening and prioritisation, we identified that the existence of inconsistencies and delays in this respect was an issue for us.  Since February of this year, we have been applying the national approach to practice at the front door during the analysis stage.  This has allowed us to bring much better consistency and rigour to the process.  We know that gathering information, supplying good analysis and judgment and involving everyone in that process is really important in effective child protection systems.  As part of our efforts to embed that approach to practice at the front door, we have completed four pilot sites - one in each region around the country - since February of this year.  We are applying the methodology at the front door.  We are looking at unallocated cases in those areas and at new cases coming into the system.  Consultants are sitting beside social workers as they take calls.  They are supporting them in using the national approach to practice.  We are planning to roll out this piece of work across all the other areas by the end of this year.  It will help us to decide what we take in or do not take in.  It will help us to get the right service to the right child for the right reason.  We are embedding that.  During the work we have done to date, staff have been telling us that this approach is leading to more timely responses to priority cases and better analysis from the first call that is received.  When we have been doing this work, we have seen a 30% average reduction in non-allocated cases.  Relationship-based work is first and foremost when social workers are engaging with families and finding networks for children from the outset.  Safety planning is beginning earlier as well.  We are seeing real improvements in what is happening as part of the screening and prioritisation exercise.  New revised guidance for the entire service will come out of that work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Quinlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I should have pointed out that the ten minutes that are available to me include the time taken up by the witnesses' responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#E01100","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Apologies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#E01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Quinlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>It might seem like I am cutting off the witnesses as they respond to me.

Tusla is dealing with many legacy issues.  This is affecting the reputation of the organisation.  It is incumbent on Tusla officials to address that.  Tusla is sometimes unfairly talked about or hammered for cases that arose before the organisation came into being.  Tusla has to deal with that.  Tusla should deal with that, try to explain where the problems have come from and what it is doing about them.  This is because it affects the morale of staff working in Tusla.  It affects the ability of the agency to recruit and retain staff.  It also affects public confidence in Tusla.  It is important to put out the message that many of these issues are legacy issues.  They are present in many other elements of our country and in various Departments.  That is unfortunate but it is a fact of life.  I am keen to see the agency do a little more to defend itself and articulate better what it is dealing with and why as well as how it intends to deal with those issues.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to staffing.  Clearly, Tusla does not have enough social workers.  When we had the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs before the committee this time last year, she was honest in saying that even with all the courses in third-level institutions being full and churning out qualified graduates, we are still playing catch-up.  We are far behind the level at which we need to be.<\/p> <p>  I accept Mr. McBride's comment to the effect that social workers are enthusiastic and committed.  I do not doubt that for a moment.  They have extremely heavy caseloads and are far beyond safe levels.  I have one specific question.  What is the average caseload for a social worker?  What is the recommended caseload for a social worker?  We may as well put out what exactly we are dealing with.<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to the alternatives to social workers and how we can use the budget if we cannot find the people we need now.  I know for a fact that social workers go home at the end of each day and then type up their own notes, send emails, stuff their own envelopes and post their own letters.  That is fine when they have the time to do it, but they do not most of the time.  When are we going to see administrative staff come online?  To me, it sounds like an immediate requirement.  Administrative staff should be in place now.  There should be a pool of administrative staff, with one secretary for every five social workers.  Something along those lines would work to take the stress off social workers in having to do the basic day-to-day administration.  That would free up time.  When will that come online?  A total of &euro;40 million has been allocated to Tusla this year.  I assume that we will have similar funding for next year, if not more.  What is it being spent on?  Where is the &euro;40 million being spent this year?  What is it going on?<\/p> <p>  Are there alternatives to social workers?  Obviously, prevention is far better than dealing with a child who needs to be taken from her home.  Early intervention is key.  What is Tusla doing around creative community alternatives to try to prevent children coming in to care in the first instance?  What is Tusla doing around addiction, counselling and parenting services?  There are basic things that should be done.  Do we need to go into a family home to help families to clean the house or to help the parent get the child to school in morning?  That may involve hiring a taxi.  That is basic stuff.  What level of funding is going into such work this year?  What level of funding will go into that work next year?  What additional services will Tusla bring on stream that will come under the umbrella of creative additional community alternatives?<\/p> <p>  Other issues arise in respect of early intervention.  What is the plan regarding family resource centres?  Are we going to open more of them?  Where will they be located?  Does Tulsa have enough funding to do that?  Does Tusla need more funding for that next year?  How much is Tusla spending on that this year?  What will Tusla spend on it next year?<\/p> <p>  Where are the pinch points in Tusla resources?  What does Tusla need?  Do we need to be putting pressure on the Minister and the Government for budget 2019?  We are moving into budget negotiations now.  I am also a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  We are now getting in submissions from the various sectors on what they are looking for.  What is Tusla specifically seeking in 2019?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#F00800","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>There are a range of helpful points and no one person can answer them all.

The Deputy asked a question about Tusla inheriting legacy issues.  She mentioned how, at times, we have been hammered for various things.  In many ways we welcome the opportunity to be here to talk about positive initiatives the agency is undertaking.  I am keen to mention something we can really be proud of as an agency.  The investigations and the work we are doing have found that we provide a child-centred service.  We are passionate about ensuring the voices of children and parents are heard in everything we do.  It is vital that their voices are heard in how we deliver services.  They can influence the way we work.<\/p> <p>  One example is that we have invested significantly in the training of staff with regard to child participation.  We are keen to ensure that, at all times, this is a cornerstone of our culture.  At present within Tusla we have 45 teams throughout the country.  These teams have been awarded an independent quality mark called the Investing in Children Membership Award.  Those responsible for the quality mark have independently verified that Tusla staff are doing really good strong child participatory work.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the caseload.  I have been a social worker and a social work manager.  A social worker may be allocated 12 children in care.  Of those 12 children in care, it may be that six are really settled in foster care.  They may be doing really well, going to school and may be really attached to their foster carers.  There may be no court work linked to such cases.  The social worker will have a role to visit the child and ensure that the placement is meeting the needs of the child in question.  In contrast, a social worker might have four children in the caseload who are in real difficulty and who have really strong presentation of trauma.  They may be presenting with complex needs.  Their foster carers or family may be really struggling.  Such cases may take far more time.  That is why we have brought in our caseload management system.  This something we are leading on throughout Europe with our caseload management system.  The idea is to provide a weighting to different types of cases.  We provide a reduced caseload weighting for our newer graduates.  Again, it is about retaining them and ensuring they have a manageable workload.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Finlay"},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I wish to make a point of clarification.

Our social workers are now more mobile.  One wonders in this day and age why we did not have mobility earlier.  Social workers use all sorts of mobile device.  It means that they can do work, rather than sit for three hours doing very little while waiting for a case to be called in court.  Case recording was one of the issues highlighted by HIQA.  Social workers can visit families and type up case notes in their car or somewhere quiet which are immediately linked with the national child care information system, NCCIS.  Social workers have told us mobile technology has saved them between five and ten hours a week, which represents real progress.<\/p> <p>  Prevention has been mentioned.

As Mr. McBride said, I lead the prevention, partnership and family support programme.  Around 2013, within the Health Service Executive as it was at the time, we set out a question for ourselves and brought in people like the chief executive of Barnados, representatives of the Daughters of Charity and the chief executive of Pobal.  Senior managers in the HSE asked what was needed to really advance family support services.  As a result, our prevention, partnership and family support programme was born.  It comprises a number of strands.  Supporting parenting is the core business for all of us.  Our business is supporting parents across the continuum of care.  Sometimes it is providing top-up advice and support that we all need as parents.  That support leads to mandating in the supervision of parents in more difficulty, for example, at the top end of the continuum.  There is our corporate parenting piece, our children in care piece.  We act in <i>loco parentis<\/i>for over 6,000 children who are in the care of the State.  In identifying what supporting parents means across the continuum of care and the evidence that tells us how best to support them, parenting 24\/7 is a set of key messages based around four practitioners.  If one is working with parents across the life cycle of a child and in different circumstances, what do we need to think about?  For example, fathers matter.  When I sit in on a case conference, I must ensure the voice of the father is heard in the room also.  <br\/><br\/>My colleague has mentioned participation.  There is a strand of work associated with it.  We have trained 1,300 staff across the country in participatory practice with children and young people.  In such training the child is put at the centre of decision-making in their own lives.  Children are encouraged to be part of the decision-making process in how we design, develop, deliver and evaluate our services.  We have many such examples. <br\/><br\/>Another piece is our area-based approach - the prevention, partnership and family support programme.  As part of the continuum of services that Mr. Quinlan articulated, we have established within Tusla an early intervention pathway.  We have put in place senior managers for prevention, partnership and family support within the 17 area management structures.  Below them we have senior co-ordinators and co-ordinators who have established 99 child and family support networks across the country.  We operate Meitheal, our early identification of need and practical help tool.  We have many examples of parents who have stood out publicly.  One striking example of success is a non-national lady who came to the country with her husband.  Unfortunately, he left her with three very young children and no money.  She was living in a flat complex that was burned out and  ended up in homeless services, which was good because she ended up back in our services.  she has been part of the Meitheal process for the past two years.  When she came to the country, she could not speak English, but now she can.  Her children are doing well and she is accessing training and employment.<br\/><br\/>Our high prevention piece is our creative community alternative whereby we work very hard to keep in the community children who are on the edge of care and children who are in care.  That means that we view the child in the context of the family and the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aisling Gillen"},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I am conscious that I am out of time.

They were not getting help from others and were going around to everyone.  We rolled out the scheme on seven sites and hope to expand to 17 next year.  We have achieved efficiencies within our budget to help us with the project.  If we can prevent children from leaving their families and communities, we will not have to spend a significant amount of money per week on private residential placements.<\/p> <p>  A couple of questions were asked about administration work.  The Deputy is right in saying social workers should not waste time doing filing, etc.  The national child care information system is pretty good and does a lot for social workers.  More importantly, Mr. McBride and I visited an area manager by the name of Caroline in north Dublin who told us that she spent the first three and half months of her current job working on appeals.  It is a fact that we have totally relied on the HSE for a significant period to perform all of these corporate functions, but we need to be self-sufficient.  We have stated this in documents and communications we have sent to the Department which supports our desire to be self-sufficient.  In order to succeed, we are building a regional business and administrative hub based around the service directors in which there will be expertise in managing freedom of information requests, replies to parliamentary questions and getting answers to Members in a more efficient way.  <\/p> <p>  Health and safety is another matter.  Tusla is a large organisation.  As our CEO has stated, we need to work within many frameworks and show that ours is a safe and consistent agency. <\/p> <p>  I want area managers to meet their principal social workers to analyse unallocated cases, referrals, the cases of children in care and support our staff in that work.  We have created administrative posts in the past two years at social work team level.  They need such support.<\/p> <p>  Let us consider the issue of foster care.  HIQA's inspection report identified that we fell down when it came to Garda vetting.  If we did not have everyone vetted in the three year cycle, ours was deemed not to be a safe and effective service.  Having a good administrative support process - a Garda vetting unit within Tusla - generated a significant improvement in that regard.  That is a good example of how administrative issues were dealt with by good and efficient measures. <\/p> <p>  Family resource centres have been mentioned.  We have spoken about the sad fact that children must tell their stories many times.  We are really good in Ireland in making assessments.  As an agency, we say a child only needs one assessment.  He or she then needs to receive therapeutic support.  As many as 11 more family resource centres are coming on stream.  I am totally responsible for the 6,130 children in the care of the State.  I am not saying they all need a therapeutic intervention, but a good number of them as a result of experiencing neglect and abuse.  We are building therapeutic hubs using our partnerships with the community and voluntary sector.  We have a pilot scheme operating in counties Waterford and Wexford which is working well and children are receiving support.  We want to support children in care.  In north Dublin there is a creative alternative community programme that supports children in foster care who present with challenging behaviours.<\/p><p>Foster carers need the correct supports.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gibson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Is the therapeutic hub in the family resource centre?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#H00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":74,"content":"<p>If one looks at Dublin, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre has expertise in therapeutic interventions.

We had a discussion on 22 February 2017 when the witness appeared before the committee, and I read that report last night.  The need to integrate 17 IT systems was mentioned.  Many topics have been discussed already, so I am not going to discuss that issue again.<\/p> <p>   It was said that there was no electronic communication between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Does Tusla use email?  That is electronic communication.  Why did that not supersede letters or faxes?  I do not even put a fax number on my own literature any more because nobody uses fax machines, but I read, in the report I was given, that the precedent was set as post and faxes.  I understand that the systems are not integrated and a vanilla system is not in place.  Why were PDFs or spreadsheets not put on email so that an electronic record would have been available in the event of an audit carried out by the Garda or any other agency?  Why did that not take precedent over post or fax?  <\/p> <p>  I would appreciate some comments around HR and accountability.  There seems to have been a disjointed approach taken or some dysfunction in terms of how people applied themselves to their tasks, or indeed the process or model of how they were supposed to engage with their roles.  Who oversaw that?  Who was supposed to make sure that was done correctly?  I have read reports that suggested there was evidence of insufficient oversight to assure the executive and board of Tusla that staff members were adhering to the corporate procedures.  Who oversees that?  What part of the organisation makes sure that that actually happens?  Why is it so disjointed across the different sectors?  <\/p> <p>  It was mentioned that the electronic communication system will not be in place until 2019, but that the IT system will be available for use in July 2018.  We have been given emails.  Can the witness clarify that?  <\/p> <p>  In terms of recruitment of social workers, does Tusla have an outline of the recruitment process or model from end to end?  I do not expect the witnesses to articulate it orally, but if a copy of that could be provided to the committee it would be appreciated.  We want to know how many steps or processes a person has to go through in the recruitment chain, from end to end, and what other parts of the public service are involved.  That information would give us an impression of whether the process is too laborious or too long, leading to people dropping out of it.  It would also be good to know if any statistics have been collected around people dropping out of the recruitment process.  Where do they fall out of the process?  Does it represent 60%, 70% or 80%?  Given studies from overseas or in the UK, has Tusla carried out any studies around the blockages in recruitment been carried out?  It would be good to know why people will not come to the Republic of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#H00400","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I am not sure if HIQA was referring to email communication.

This is about modernising that process.  I do not want to speak about another State agency.  I accept what the Deputy has said, and agree that we need to modernise.  We have made one big step in that regard with our integrated childcare system.  If we get a referral or mandated report through the new portal it automatically drops down to the region and area where the report originated.  We had three members of staff working in our IT department until recently.  We did not even have a director of ICT until six months ago.  We are now building that capacity.  This is about modernisation, and being able to track information and communication between staff and between our agency and other agencies.  We have to deal with it.<\/p> <p>  The connection with the Garda PULSE system is possible, but there are some problems that have to be resolved from an IT, technical and information - data protection - perspective.  It will happen, but it will take time.  We are now using smart equipment, and the level of change we have seen has been significant for an agency that had many different types of databases in 32 areas.  Those 32 areas shrunk to 17 areas when Tusla was established, which was a significant challenge for the agency.  On 9 July every functional area in Tusla will be connected, which will ensure stronger oversight.  That system allows me, as a manager of a social work team, to look at all of the work going on in that team by all of the social workers.  <\/p> <p>  One of the issues mentioned by HIQA in its report was that we were quite slow to identify poor practice or concern about poor practice.  I am the team leader and I, the principal or the CEO, if he or she wishes, can take that helicopter-like overview of the system.  It can be clearly seen where someone is not recording things, and records which do not show good practice or incidents where a child-centred approach is not taken can easily be identified.  That has really modernised matters for us.  We are on a roll in terms of modernisation, and as one of the Deputies has said, we are aware that we are dealing with legacy issues.  The modernisation of the system was a huge legacy issue for us.  We are modernising now.  We only give laptops to professional people now.<\/p><p>We do not give them desktops because they are mobile.  We also supplement that with smartphones.  They are connected to their system now, wherever they are.  That is a huge thing.  The next piece is the direct work with children.  Our director is looking at apps that directly engage with children.  Children do not want to sit and talk to somebody.  They want a mechanism.  On the laptop, we will have apps to do direct work with children.  We are mid-stream in this modernisation and we are going in the right direction.<\/p><p> I email lots of people across the country in different agencies in my role as chief operations officer.  The traditional communication of Garda notifications was by letter and still is but now we are seeing them coming through in our portal.  I think in the last report, there were over 300 Garda-mandated reports that had come through the portal.  We can clarify the figures and give them to the committee.

To be clear, retrospective abuse is when a person comes forward today and alleges they were abused in the past, when they were a child, and they are concerned that the person who abused them may be in contact with children today.  Our obligation is to try to identify the child today who might be at risk from that individual.  When we have an identified child and reasonable grounds to suspect that he or she might be at risk, of course we intervene in the situation and such children go up on our system like any other child referred to our service today.<\/p> <p>  The secondary issue is that when we have this information, this person might, for example, be in a position of employment where they are working with children or might be part of a youth club.  Since the enactment of the legislation, case law has made the interpretation that we have a responsibility to proactively protect children who might be at risk from this person.  In doing so, our obligation is to share relevant information with relevant third parties so that they can make a protective decision.  We are obliged to consider sharing the information with a school authority, for example, so that it can take protective action against that person in the contact they have with children.<\/p> <p>  In order to share that soft information, as the Deputy can imagine, we have to have a standard of proof.  That is what the court has asked us to ensure.  We have to provide an evidential basis in order to be able to share such information because it affects a person's constitutional rights to employment and his or her good name.  That is where the legislation is weak, as we have pointed out.  We have a clear responsibility but the legislation does not give us authority.  If a victim comes forward today and has a concern, they are normally traumatised and upset.  They may begin to disclose with us and then step away from the process because of the hurt and harm it causes.  We do not have any ability to compel them to come back and speak with us or any powers to compel the person against whom allegation of abuse is being made to come and speak to us.  We are working with a responsibility but without powers of obligation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#J02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Quinlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Reading between the lines, Mr. Quinlan is saying that the legislation is weak and it needs updating or strengthening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#K00100","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":112,"content":"<p>We welcome the Minister's reference in her statement to the progression of proposals with the Department of Justice and Equality.

We appointed a national lead and regional leads for the national service improvement plan.  As of today, we have allocated all but 103 of those cases.  People get very concerned when they hear of retrospective abuse cases and so on.  Some of the analysis bears out what Mr. Quinlan said in terms of social workers having all of the responsibility without any clear authority.  It should not be forgotten that adults who have experienced an abusive life experience as a child find that incredibly difficult, painful and hurtful.  At times, they come, but pull back.  Our language is really important.  These are complainants.  They are making a disclosure, but they are making a disclosure about a criminal act perpetrated against them.  As stated by Mr. Quinlan, in 71% of retrospective cases we do not get past stage one because the complainants find it hard to tell their story to the extent that gives us sufficient information to progress to stage two.  The 71% relates to cases in the South in respect of which we analysed the work.

The themes identified in those cases include a delay in follow up and queries around timelines in terms of completion of work.  In our review we found that among the reasons for those delays was the complainant being unable to come and talk to us and additional work being necessary to get the complainant to come and tell his or her story about the disclosure.  This is an extremely difficult process for a person.  Very often he or she will have been working with a counsellor or psychiatrist for years to try to come to the point of telling us that story.  As these are retrospective cases, very often dating back 20 or 30 years ago, finding the person subject to the abuse allegation can be difficult.

How big is the problem in attracting staff?  How hard is it to get staff into the agency?  Deputy Chambers touched on this briefly but is there a need for more administrative staff?  I do not know if the agency gave a commitment to start recruiting administrative staff.  The biggest workload for social workers is administration.  Looking at this HIQA report it appears that we are back to square one with bad record keeping.  There appears to be a pattern here so perhaps the witnesses will address the question of how big an issue is staffing.  They should be honest and up-front about it.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to refer to training.  HIQA said in its report that it did not find any strong evidence of effective staff training and development.  That is alarming.  Has a review of the skills sets of staff in Tusla been undertaken to date?  What opportunities for upskilling are available to staff members?

It is difficult to recruit in terms of social work because there are only so many graduates each year and we are in competition with other agencies such as the HSE, the community and voluntary sector, the Probation Service and so forth.  I outlined earlier some of the more creative measures we are trying to put in place to recruit staff and to retain staff.  Regarding how big an issue it is, at present we have 246 social work vacancies and there is ongoing recruitment to try to recruit for them.  However, there are 156 agency staff filling some of these posts so there is a balance of 90 for which there is ongoing recruitment.  While there are 246 vacancies, we are not always good at explaining the fact that agency staff are covering a significant proportion of those posts.  Agency staff can up and leave but we have in place a plan to convert the agency staff into three year fixed-term contracts to provide some stability.  That is roughly the position with recruitment.<\/p> <p>  As we mentioned already, administrative staff are very much part of the plan and part of the considerations for changing and improving the skills mix.  It not always about getting in social workers, but also front-line professionals such as social care workers and family support workers and the administrative staff to support them.  We can provide separately a breakdown of the number of staff we are recruiting by grade if the Deputy wishes.<\/p> <p>  On staff training and development, some time ago we launched our continuous professional development strategy and as part of that we are doing training needs analyses.  People will have personal development plans as a result of that - it is not all in place yet - which will contain their training and development needs on an individual basis for the future.  Signs of Safety is the national approach to practise and we have trained about 1,200 of 1,500 social workers on this new approach.

There are many mature professional people in the community and voluntary sector who would like to follow a career in social work but due to their financial and family commitments cannot go off to college for four years to do a masters degree.  We welcome the recommendation in the report on the high level group to examine this issue.  If I could ask a training university to develop a course that would allow our staff to go on block release but remain in employment we would get two things - we would get people who are committed to our agency and want to remain in our agency and we would also invest in their professional development through professional qualification.  We need to move quickly on that to bolster our staff.  The demand is outstripping the supply in Ireland at present.  We do not train enough social workers.  There are other avenues for social workers to go to now in disability, elderly and mental health services.  We are in competition with them.

We are putting in local mechanisms and oversight groups to ensure that when a policy lands, it is implemented consistently.  We are also trying to keep our policies to a minimum.

When this occurs, one is not able to take the matter any further.  Ms Finlay has given some indication of some of the reasons we cannot progress things, one being that the disclosure is insufficiently detailed.  Alternatively, because of the space we have been put in by case law, we cannot compel the person against whom the allegation is being made to come forward and give any response to it.  Sometimes, therefore, the inquiries run into the sand.  Those are some of the reasons.<\/p> <p>  It is absolutely true that there are inconsistencies in safety planning.

The amendments propose to provide for the creation of an offence in the case that a person advertises, or causes to be advertised, an alcohol product on an information society service unless all reasonable steps are taken to ensure the advertisement cannot be viewed by children.  These steps include whether age verification controls have been used to prevent access by children to an advertisement.  This amendment uses the framework of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive which comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten.  My officials have previously consulted that Department and the Department of Justice and Equality on this matter.<\/p> <p>  The Audiovisual Media Services Directive is a sector-specific directive for television and services that are similar to television.  I am informed that the extension of its scope is to include any audiovisual content on any platform would cut across several EU directives and other regulations.  In addition, I have concerns about the effectiveness of this proposed provision.  For example, if it was introduced for websites hosted in Ireland, advertisers could simply move to websites which are not hosted in Ireland to avoid the necessity to comply with this proposed amendment.  Finally, I am unclear as to how effective age verification controls could be implemented under the proposal.  A reliance on self-disclosure is not a robust method of enforcement as children may simply claim to be over 18 and, therefore, access the alcohol advertising.  European legislation, similar to the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, which addresses all the issues regarding intermediary or online platforms, is required to address the issues involved and I do not propose to accept the amendments.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 30 proposes to change the broadcasting watershed times in the Bill that applies to radio broadcasts to make them the same as those that apply to television.  The watershed times were set out to prohibit alcohol advertising during times when children might be in the audience.  For radio, the watershed times provide that alcohol advertisements can be broadcast at times children are at school during the week and at any time on weekends.  These times were agreed in consultation with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, which have the expertise in this area.  I am conscious that we are introducing new prohibitions on advertising with this Bill and inherent in this new regime will be the potential loss of advertising revenue to broadcasters.  However, I am determined that we address the proven impact that advertising alcohol to children can have.  On that basis, I will follow the advice given, and targeting this measure to times when children are likely to be in the audience for radio to ensure that this measure is both effective and proportionate.  Section 21 provides that the Minister for Health must carry out a review of the advertising sector after three years.  On this basis we can examine thee provisions again after we have had an opportunity to see their effects in practice.  For these reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#B00700","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>The purpose of the amendments is to deal with the consumption of alcohol by minors and the targeting of children and minors through advertising.

Under that section, the Minister can make regulations to prohibit or restrict the sale of alcohol at a reduced price or giving it free on the purchase of another product or service.  The target here is buy-one-get-one-free offers; selling alcohol at a reduced price for a limited period, defined as three days or less, for a price less than what it cost the day before the limited period; promotions such as happy hours promotions; anything that is intended or likely to encourage those present at a place, other than a private residence, to drink alcohol harmfully; selling alcohol at a reduced price or giving it free in a manner likely to encourage the consumption of alcohol in a harmful way; and advertising or promoting the sale of alcohol in ways that are prohibited or restricted.<\/p> <p>  The definition of \"sell2 under section 2 is comprehensive and includes supplying for the purposes of selling or exposing for sale or distributing free of charge.

The research found that the inclusion of messaging in the Irish language served to confuse the message.

I am happy at this stage that we can proceed on the basis that the Minister is indicating via his amendment that there will be warning labels.  I put on record that the warning labels must be stark.  They must fulfil their purpose, be informative and let people know exactly what is involved and what the dangers are.

A health committee must be very careful about what it says and does and what message it sends out in terms of adherence to good practice.  The issue that has arisen in this particular case concerns the space devoted to warning people who might consume alcohol.  That is understandable.  I presume Irish products are no more carcinogenic than products from the United States, France or any other country in Europe or outside it.  The worry is that perhaps the impression might be given abroad that Irish products are particularly harmful when other products constitute a similar threat.  We accept that warnings are required on labelling but we must be sure that goods imported into this country by competitors carry the same level of warning and I am not certain we can enforce that.<\/p> <p>  I have not gone through the directives and even though I can remember most things I do not remember the detail of the relevant one off the top of my head.  It is sad.  I agree in principle but I add a note of caution on the inherent danger.  It is a bit like the proposal for a capital transaction tax.  It is great if everybody does it.  I have no problem with that at all.  If it is done by everybody right across the board, including for imported goods, we are then on an even footing.  However, if it is only applicable to us in this jurisdiction, notwithstanding the directive, then we could place ourselves at a disadvantage.

Opposition amendments Nos. 10, 13 and 20 propose the removal of the amendments to the labelling and advertising provisions made in Seanad &Eacute;ireann which inserted a warning on the direct link between alcohol and fatal cancers.  Amendment No. 10 proposes to remove this warning from the labels of products.  Amendment No. 13 proposes its removal from the notice on licensed premises and amendment No. 20 proposes to remove the warning from advertisements.<\/p> <p>  At the time of the introduction of the cancer warnings in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the Minister for Health expressed the view that having a specific warning for cancer could create a hierarchy of diseases and potentially have the effect of implying that other equally serious conditions are less important.  The original intention of the health warnings provision was to ensure that consumers are informed of the generality of health risks associated with alcohol and not to highlight one particular risk.<\/p> <p>  Since that time the measure of including a cancer warning on labels was assessed at EU level under Regulation No. 1169 of 2011 on the provision of food information to consumers.  On 2 May the European Commission communicated its decision that it was not issuing a negative opinion on the provision.  A negative opinion would have effectively blocked the provision from being enacted.  As no negative opinion was issued there is no block at EU level to this measure being enacted.  The Commission response stated that it would further assess this issue when the draft regulations on the format of the warning are submitted to it.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of this measure is to provide health information to the consumer on the link between alcohol and fatal cancers.  It is no more than that.  The result of the provision will be that consumers will be made aware of the settled international scientific consensus that there is a link between alcohol and cancers and he or she can make a decision on that basis.<\/p> <p>  Rather than discussing why we should introduce this measure perhaps the real questions is why should we as consumers not know about the direct link between alcohol and fatal cancers.  The 2016 Healthy Ireland survey found that only 21% of respondents were aware of the link between alcohol and breast cancer when drinking more than the recommended number of standard drinks and only 16% of women between the ages of 15 and 24 knew of it.  Only 40% knew of the risk in relation to bowel cancer.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 13 proposes to delete the reference to the link with cancer on the notices that will be placed on premises which sell alcohol in reusable containers such as by the glass in an on-licensed premises.  I do not see why the consumer who buys alcohol by the glass should not have access to the same information as one who buys it in a labelled container.  Amendment No. 20 removes the warning from advertisements.  The provisions on advertising are designed so that consumers can make informed choices about drinking alcohol but also to ensure that advertisements for alcohol products will no longer be able to portray alcohol as being entirely positive and risk free.<\/p><p>Billions of euro have been spent each year on the advertising of alcohol and research demonstrates it is effective.  As legislators, we have the responsibility to balance the risk-free messaging in advertising with factual information about its risks.  For these reasons I do not propose to accept the amendments.<\/p><p> Deputy Durkan spoke about competition and this will apply to all products sold in the State and will not apply to any products intended for sale outside the State.  There will be no case where an Irish product will be required to have such information and compete with products manufactured elsewhere.  Deputy Kelly dealt with labelling with cancer warnings.  As Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion I know it is very important to communicate to members of the public the proven harm that alcohol can cause to health and that the wide range of serious illnesses caused by alcohol includes cancer.  I also acknowledge the work of the Irish Cancer Society on this matter.  Members of the Opposition may push an amendment to remove the cancer warning but it can be dealt with again on Report Stage if the amendment is withdrawn.  In the meantime I will speak to the Minister about this again.  I do not know if that would be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#F00700","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":314,"content":"<p>There is a reference to measurement of calories, which the Minister of State mentioned earlier.

This provision echoes the approach to that taken to licensed premises in the Bill selling products that do not have a label.  However, there is a significant difference.  It is fair to say that we are all likely to spend more time in a restaurant or pub than in an airport shop.  The time spent in a licensed premises means that the message on the notice has more time to attract our attention, once or several times, and perhaps even encourage discussions on its contents with those around us.  There is no similarity between this and an airport, which for the majority of consumers is a place that we are passing through in a hurry with an eye on a flight time.<\/p> <p>  One of the strengths of this provision as it currently stands is that no unfair competition is created within the State.  Every retailer in the State must sell products with the health information on them and they are not forced to compete with another retailer who does not have to have this information on its stock.  It will undermine the fairness of the provisions if retailers in airports are allowed to sell products without that information on the product.  Finally I do not wish to introduce any unnecessary complexity for suppliers that deal strictly with the domestic market.  The provision as it stands requires that all products sold in the State must have health information.  I see no reason to introduce a further requirement that suppliers will have to distinguish between products for airports and products for other retail outlets in the State.  For these reasons I do not propose to accept these amendments.

This requirement was provided for in an amendment to the Bill that was accepted on Report Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I note other Deputies have also proposed removal of this provision.  I am proposing to remove it as a result of its assessment by the European Commission.<\/p><p>The provision was assessed under Directive EU 2015\/1535, laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on information society services.  That assessment examined the provision in the context of Article 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Article 34 prohibits a legislative measure which has an equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction on imports.  Member states are allowed by Article 36 of the treaty to enact such a measure for the protection of health only if it can be shown that the measure is proportionate.  To be proportionate, a measure must not go beyond what is necessary in order to attain its objective.<\/p><p>In its comments on the requirement that at least one third of the size of the printed material on the alcohol product be given over to evidence-based health warnings, the European Commission said that it was not proportionate.  It is the Commission's view that the objective of the protection of health through provision of health warnings on alcohol products could be met by a lesser restriction, such as a requirement that the health warning be of a smaller, yet visible, size.  The purpose of providing for health warnings on alcohol products is to make us all aware of the health risks associated with alcohol so that we can make an informed choice.  If those warnings are visible, then the objective is achieved.  The requirement that a proportion of the printed material be given over to such a warning does on the face of it go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives.  It might prove very difficult for Ireland to defend the measure in the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Equally, those from outside the State who wish to sell in the State will have to comply with our rules, however that happens.  My understanding is that can happen in a variety of ways.  Either labelling can be done where the product is manufactured or the distributors can attach an additional label, which is the case with other products.  A multiplicity of labels for different markets already exists within the industry.  We simply would be requiring a specific label for this State.  The hope is that we will be a leading light and other countries will eventually take our lead, which would make the requirement significantly less onerous as one label became more useful in more countries.

We should be conscious of that and ensure that \"one third of labelling\" means \"one third of visible labelling\" rather than \"one third of total labelling on the bottle\".<\/p> <p>  The idea that putting a label on a bottle is a massive job and has a significant cost is almost like saying there is someone going around with a roll of labels sticking them on each bottle.  It is a cheap and simple thing to do, but it is being beefed up into something far greater.  We can get this to work for imported medicines with overlabelling, so I cannot see any barrier to doing the same in respect of alcohol.  We are labelling for the Irish people and the Irish market, and we do not need to be overly concerned about other countries' behaviour.  With the smoking ban, we were the leading country.  As Deputy O'Reilly mentioned, we could be the lead in this respect as well and other countries could follow suit.<\/p> <p>  I do not ever want to fall out with Deputy Durkan, but the irradiation of food having a similar carcinogenic effect as alcohol is just a little bit of a sweeping statement for the health committee on a Wednesday morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#J00700","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>No, no.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#J00800","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":354,"content":"<p>If the Deputy would like to provide the data-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#J00900","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#J01000","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":356,"content":"<p>-----we can have a big fight about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#J01100","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1529481600,"counter":357,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":358,"content":"<p>That claim has emerged.

The offence under the Bill relates to selling alcohol products within the State without the required warning and information.  Any person who sells an alcohol product without the required warning and information can be prosecuted under the section.  The range of persons who can be prosecuted includes wholesalers, manufacturers and retailers.  If a product is manufactured in the State without the required labelling information and products are sold to a retailer or wholesaler in the State, the manufacturer can be prosecuted.  The wholesaler and retailer also may be prosecuted if they sell the product on without the required labelling.  It is not an offence to import for sale in the State an alcohol product that does not bear the required information and warning.  However, a person who imports an alcohol product that does not have the required labelling and sells the product within the State without affixing the required information and warning will be prosecuted.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Donnelly's question, this will be done by way of regulations, which will have to include a provision that labelling will be visible.

It is not just a public health measure but also a child protection measure.  All evidence suggests that the earlier a person is initiated into alcohol consumption, the greater the likelihood of negative alcohol-related outcomes later in life.  As such, one of the key aims of alcohol policy should be to delay that initiation into drinking among young people.  Many of the measures in this Bill are targeted at that.  For example, alcohol-related merchandise will not be sold in sizes suitable for children under this Bill, which is a good idea.  However, the prohibition on outdoor advertising within 200 m of schools, while welcome, suggests that children only exist within the school environment.  They have to come and go from school, they socialise and they live in communities.  Where there is outdoor advertising, it is not possible to simply shield the eyes of the child.  It does not work like that.  The logic is that advertising will not be permitted within 200 m but will be allowed within 201 m.  If we are serious about this it has to be more than a simple box-ticking exercise.  Concrete measures must be taken on child protection.<\/p><p>The second amendment defines a &quot;public place&quot;.

As a first step in restricting the advertising of alcohol products outdoors, it was considered appropriate to target the restrictions at areas most frequented by children and young people.  The Bill, therefore, provides that a person shall not advertise, or cause the advertisement of an alcohol product in a park or open space owned or maintained by a local authority or the Office of Public Works, OPW; in or on a public service vehicle; in or on a train or on a light rail vehicle; in or at a train or bus station; at a designated bus or Luas stop, in or at a school, including its grounds, or within 200 m of the perimeter of the grounds; in or at a place where an early years service is carried on or within 200 m of its perimeter; or in or at a playground owned or maintained by a local authority or within 200 m of the perimeter of such playground.<\/p> <p>  Section 21 provides that there must be a review of all the advertising provisions within three years of the commencement of that section.  The issue of advertising restrictions will be revisited as part of this review.  I do not propose, therefore, to accept the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#K03900","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Is there a provision in the Bill that allows for an ongoing review of this?

Advertising is a broad description.  This is an issue in other areas.  I would like to know the ministerial view on that.

This is a practical first step in the right direction.  It may not tick all the boxes but as we continue, hopefully it will.  A core aim of the Bill is to delay alcohol consumption by children and young people and reduce the harm caused by the misuse of alcohol.  The Bill also has significant relevance to children living in Ireland.  Where a child enters his or her own local shop or garage, he or she will not see alcohol products or alcohol advertising in the general area of the shop.  Clothing intended for wear by children that refers to or promotes an alcohol product will not be manufactured, imported or sold in the State.  When a child watches TV between 3 a.m. and 9 p.m. alcohol advertising will not be aired.  When a child attends an event specifically for children, he or she will be exposed to alcohol images or messages.  When a child attends and age-appropriate film in a cinema, he or she will not be exposed to alcohol advertising.  As a child enters or leaves his or her school or cr&egrave;che, and in the surrounding 200 m, he or she will not be exposed to alcohol images or messages.  When a child plays in a public authority park, he or she will not be exposed to alcohol advertising.  As a child waits for and boards public transport or a school bus, he or she will not be exposed to these images or messages.  These are all clearly stated in the Bill.

Opposition amendment No. 28 proposes to prohibit sports sponsorship by 31 December 2023.  This topic was examined and debated at length prior to the publication of the Bill.  A consensus could not be reached on a prohibition on sports sponsorship.  There have been many discussions about the pros and cons of banning alcohol sponsorship of sports in Ireland.  The main arguments in favour of a ban have centred around concerns about patterns of alcohol consumption and related harms and the \"normalising\" of drinking this sponsorship purportedly brings about.  The arguments against such a ban were that the funding gap left by such a move would be extremely difficult to bridge, affecting all levels of sports, including grassroots levels for young people.  There is a lack of specific evidence that such a ban would be effective.  During discussions with the Joint Committee on Health and Children at the time, the then Minister, now Taoiseach, indicated that in the medium term a ban on alcohol sponsorship was not realistic.  Therefore, as a beginning, the measures in the Bill aim to restrict the alcohol advertising permitted at sporting events and the sponsorship of events in which the majority of participants or competitors are children, events aimed particularly at children or events involving the driving or racing of motor vehicles.  The Bill provides at section 21 that there must be a review of all the advertising provisions within three years of the commencement of that section.  The issue of sports sponsorship will be revisited as part of this review.

It is no harm to bear in mind the effects.  I do not intend to enumerate them but I do feel there needs to be a separate warning in respect of events of a particular nature in any event, even if this legislation were to cover them.  I can think of a number of celebratory events in which young people naturally get involved and which they have reason to celebrate, but there needs to be some control over the extent to which the celebrations go.  Numerous events have been brought to our attention over the years whereby, with the benefit of hindsight, we can say that if they did not happen, there might have been different outcomes, not tragic outcomes.  We can visualise in our minds the broad spectrum of events this encompasses.  They are many and varied, and I do not want to identify any of them specifically at this stage, other than to say it is no harm to bear them in mind.

Finally, it redrafts the provision for clarity.  Subsection (6) of section 18 relates to a publication that is published by or on behalf of the holder of an off-licence where such a publication is intended to promote the sale of alcohol products in the off-licensed premises.  As set out in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill as initiated, it was intended that such publications would be exempted from certain requirements of section 18 in recognition that they are of a special category.  The intention was to exempt such publications from the prohibitions in section 18(2) on alcohol advertisements on the front and back cover of a publication and on any wrapper or other covering in which they are contained.<\/p><p>In addition, it was intended to exempt them from prohibition in section 18(3) on the importation of publications which have more than 20% of their advertising space given over to alcohol advertisements or which contain advertisements in breach of section 18(2).  The provision, as currently drafted, does not reflect the policy intentions owing to a failure to update references when a proposed subsection was removed from section 18(2) of the Bill as initiated; a failure to update references when an amendment to section 18(3)(<i>c<\/i>) in Seanad &Eacute;ireann split the subsection into section 18(3)(<i>c<\/i>) and section 18(3)(<i>d<\/i>); and a printing error which replaced the reference to subsection (3)(<i>c<\/i>) with a reference to subsection (3).<br\/><br\/>I am making no policy changes with this amendment and its sole purpose is to reflect what was intended and set out in the Bill as initiated.  This amendment will mean that under section 18(6), in respect of a publication which is published by or on behalf of an off-licence holder for the purposes of promoting the sale of products in the premises, the prohibition from publishing a publication in which more than 20% of the advertising space is used for the advertisement of alcohol products in section 18(1) should not apply, the prohibition in section 18(2) on alcohol advertisements on the front and back cover or on any covering or wrapping of a publication shall not apply and the prohibitions in section 18(3) on importing a publication in which more than 20% of the advertising space is being used for advertisement of alcohol products or on importing a publication which contains an advertisement that contravenes section 18(2) shall not apply.
