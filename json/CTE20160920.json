Both the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, who the committee is seeing tomorrow, and I are looking forward to a fruitful and positive collaboration with the committee in the weeks and years ahead.  Innovations such as this will increase our collective understanding of the economic and fiscal challenges facing the country.  The budget will be announced on Tuesday, 11 October.<\/p> <p>  Since the publication of the Summer Economic Statement in June, the national economic dialogue has taken place.  This provided a cross-section of stakeholders an opportunity to have an open and inclusive exchange on the competing economic perspectives in advance of budget 2017.  Subsequently, in a new departure and in line with commitments made to the select committee on arrangements for budget scrutiny, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published its mid-year expenditure report and my Department circulated the Tax Strategy Group papers and the income tax reform plan to the Oireachtas earlier this year.  With the publication of the Tax Strategy Group papers and the income tax reform plan, I fulfilled two commitments in the new programme for Government to help make the annual budgetary process more transparent and to provide Oireachtas Members with the ability to make proposals, which, in part, is why we are here today.<\/p> <p>  The Tax Strategy Group papers run to 250 pages and set out existing measures across all tax heads, and contain issues for discussion as well as costed options for tax changes.  I believe the formulation of expenditure and taxation policy options will benefit from the discussion of both sets of documents and from the enhanced scrutiny and dialogue this committee can provide.  The income tax reform plan, which runs to 50 pages, sets out a menu of different options for reducing the universal social charge over the coming years.  The plan details the existing income tax and USC systems and presents three possible options to continue the phasing out of the USC.  While there are many potential options, the committee will also be aware that, due to the limited Exchequer space available, it would not be possible to phase out the USC entirely over the next three years.  Both documents were circulated over the summer and are available on the Department of Finance website.<\/p> <p>  It is also my intention that, in line with the Oireachtas budget reform report, I intend to publish the Finance Bill as soon as possible after budget day and not later than two weeks after the budget.  Indeed, in line with the Oireachtas budget scrutiny report and in order to allow more time, the Finance Bill will be shorter than in previous years and will focus on key items of budgetary importance.<\/p> <p>  The economy continues to perform strongly, as evidenced by developments in the labour market.  Employment in the second quarter of 2016 has increased by 56,200 year-on-year, while unemployment has fallen from a peak of over 15% to 8.3% in August.  Domestic demand is also growing strongly, with private consumption up 3.5% in the first half of the year.  However, the international outlook illustrates the need for caution.  The recent UK vote to leave the European Union has only added to those concerns.  My Department is currently preparing a full macroeconomic projection, in advance of the budget, which will take accounts of this and other international developments.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the fiscal position, the attainment of an underling deficit of 1% in 2015, which facilitated Ireland&rsquo;s successful exit from the excessive deficit procedure, attested to the return of the public finances to sustainability.  We can ensure this position is maintained into the medium term by the achievement of the medium-term budgetary objective of a structural deficit of 0.5% of GDP.  Based on current assumptions, this should be accomplished by 2018.  Once this goal is achieved, it will provide us with more flexibility to increase expenditure on priorities over the medium term.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the Exchequer position, this provides a real-time indicator of how the public finances are performing.<\/p><p>After the first eight months of the year, tax revenues are now &euro;449 million, or 1.6%, above target.  This equates to an annual increase of 6.2%, or &euro;1.7 billion, when compared to the same period in 2015.  While this represents a reasonably solid performance, I emphasise that we are not complacent about any challenge or risk which could emerge.  We are committed to complying with the fiscal rules which are designed to ensure increases in public expenditure are sustainably financed through the decoupling of increases in expenditure from cyclical or windfall revenues.  We are not going to repeat the mistakes of the past because we know the price.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding the fact that GDP now flatters the position to some extent, our debt-to-GDP ratio has come down strongly since the peak in 2012 and 2013.  However, as the committee has discussed with the various bodies which have appeared before it, our debt levels remain high.  We are committed to continuing to reduce this debt burden even further as part of our budgetary strategy.<\/p><p> As set out in the summer economic statement, the fiscal space available for budget 2017 will be of the order of &euro;1 billion.  I note that both the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the ESRI, representatives of which have appeared before the committee, have indicated that this is appropriate.  The fiscal space will be allocated between expenditure and revenue on a two-to-one basis.  This split between expenditure and revenue recognises the need to boost the supply of critical infrastructure following the reduction in capital investment after the economic and financial crisis.  On the revenue side, reform of the income tax system will incentivise and reward work.  Investing in infrastructure and addressing expenditure priorities while encouraging labour market participation and reforming the income tax system will serve to facilitate continued economic growth.<\/p><p> Looking to the future, there is some concern about global economic prospects.  The Government is very cognisant of the risks facing us.  It is, therefore, essential that we plan for the future in a prudent fashion.  It is for these reasons that a contingency reserve or rainy day fund will be established to which, from 2019, when we expect to run a balanced budget, &euro;1 billion will be remitted each year to provide a counter-cyclical buffer or fund to deal with any unforeseen circumstance that may arise.  <\/p><p> I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#J00100","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474360200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I call on Mr. Howard to make the opening statement on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#K00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474360200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to attend the meeting.  We look forward to assisting the committee in its work.  It might assist its deliberations if I outline at the outset the role of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners as it relates to the process of preparing the budget and the Finance Bill.  <\/p> <p>  In addition to our role in the administration of the tax code, Revenue provides support for the Minister for Finance and his Department in the development and analysis of proposals for inclusion in the budget and the Finance Bill.  Its role in supporting this process is informed by our experience of the administration of taxation.  This experience enables us to advise on the practicality of proposed measures, including avoidance and evasion risks and how they might be mitigated and administration and compliance costs for Revenue and taxpayers.  This approach applies equally whether proposed changes are in the nature of revenue raising measures or tax reliefs.<\/p> <p>  Within Revenue, there are a number of central divisions tasked with supporting the legislative process.  I am responsible for business taxes, while my colleagues, Mr. Gerard Moran and Mr. Brian Boyle, are responsible for indirect taxes and personal taxes, respectively.  Each of these divisions works closely with the tax policy division of the Department of Finance throughout the year.  From time to time, Revenue also brings specific proposals to the Department where we see a need for legislative change to improve the workings of the tax code.<\/p> <p>  In terms of preparation for the budget and the Finance Bill, we assist our colleagues in the Department by providing estimates of the likely cost or revenue raising potential of specific proposals.<\/p><p>We also assist in the preparation of papers for the tax strategy group in relation to its deliberations, draft provisions of the Finance Bill with the support of colleagues in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and provide technical support to the Minister during the passage of the Finance Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In summary, Revenue's role in the budget and Finance Bill process is one of practical and technical support in respect of the policy responsibilities of the Minister and his Department.  In that role, we are happy to assist the committee in any way we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Howard","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474360200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The first questioner is Deputy Stephen Donnelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#L00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1474360200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and everyone who has attended.  I will focus on the use by vulture funds of section 110 companies and the Minister's proposed amendment.  My calculations suggest that if we shut this down and stop the vulture funds avoiding capital gains and very significant profits on interest payments, we could double the fiscal space for next year.  There could be &euro;10 billion to &euro;20 billion available in future lost taxes.  Just for next year, we could bring the fiscal space from the current agreed assumption of &euro;1 billion to &euro;2 billion and possibly higher.  The Minister has drafted an amendment to the Finance Act, which is very welcome, and has stated that he is very open to feedback from the Oireachtas on it.  He is probably aware that the day after the amendment was put forward, the big accountancy firms were sending bulletins to their clients stating that they feel they can comfortably get around most, if not all, of it.  As such, I wanted to get the Minister's thoughts on his openness to closing it down.<\/p> <p>  I do not have the resources of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance to draft amendments.  Obviously, they must be highly technical to avoid the lawyers and accountants getting around them straight away.  There are three ways that the accountancy firms have raised themselves to indicate how these companies are going to continue to pay virtually no tax.  One is that the proposed amendment allows the assets to be marked to current market value, which obviously would erase any taxes on capital gains from the purchase to today.  As we all know, there have been significant increases in asset values since then.  The second is to continue the use of these loan notes.  While they have to be at arm's length, if one can get a big four accountancy firm to state that a 20% interest rate is reasonable given the risk, one can still do that.  The third is that it only applies to property.<\/p> <p>  I give the example of Cerberus, having gone through the 2014 accounts.  While a great deal of attention has been paid to the &euro;190 million difference of opinion between NAMA and the Comptroller and Auditor General, conservative calculations suggest that over the next ten years Cerberus will walk away on Project Eagle with approximately &pound;2 billion in gains.  Because it is using section 110, it will pay essentially no tax on that.  The Irish people have already covered over &euro;3 billion in the fall in value of the assets which NAMA bought and sold.  Is the Minister open to a conversation?  Does he agree with Cerberus that, as the amendment is currently structured, it already has approximately &euro;1 billion in capital gains.  That is broadly accepted.  It would wipe out any taxation on that &euro;1 billion in capital gains.  Going on its 2014 accounts and marking them for ten years, it looks like there will be an additional &pound;900 million in gains on the interest payments.  If Cerberus can convince an accounting firm to structure an arm's length loan and say that 18% is a reasonable yield, that will erase all taxable profits.  As the amendment currently stands, Cerberus would walk out of this country having made approximately &pound;2 billion, or &euro;2.8 billion, in gains while paying virtually no tax.<\/p><p>Cerberus would have paid virtually no tax.  Is the Minister open to shutting that option down?  Does he believe Cerberus should pay capital gains tax, corporation tax and dividend withholding tax?  I will finish with my next comment.

The initiative has worked.  Now it has been applied, where it was not intended to be applied, to property funds.  After consultation with Revenue it was decided to close what was regarded as a loophole or an unintended application of the section.<\/p> <p>  In closing it the advice was that it could not be closed retrospectively but, by putting forward a fairly detailed amendment, that it could be closed from the date of the publication of that amendment, so we are working forward.  How one would measure future revenue flows is difficult to say because, obviously, if one closes a method of applying a particular tax section people will change their behaviour.  In any calculation of possible yields one must allow for a change in behaviour.  The change in behaviour may be such that it will not be used any more if the amendment is successful.<\/p> <p>  To get back to the key point, as well as publishing with the intent of signalling to the industry that the section could no longer be used in the way it was used to reduce tax on property portfolios, it is also intended as a consultation document.  Therefore, we welcome the comments of the accountancy and tax firms and what they are saying, and we welcome comments by members as well.  <\/p> <p>  I am also aware that there is another set of issues that arise from the funds industry.  Work has to be done there as well and further amendments have to be crafted that would be appropriate.  The policy intention is that we would be able to maintain it as originally intended for the financial services industry.  If there is any abuse there we would certainly tidy it up and focus it more but we would rule it out completely for property.  I am open to advice.  The Deputy has put a lot of time into this matter and he has contributed very significantly to the public debate on the matter.

I am sorry to hear Revenue's position.  At this point Revenue should be able to give some sort of a scale.  A very small number of companies are involved in this matter.  About ten companies have bought practically all of the NAMA assets, these vulture funds and most of them have now released their accounts.  As an example, Cerberus took in interest payments for 2014 - and we have their accounts - in the sum of &euro;112 million.  It paid interest amounting to about &euro;27 million to Nomura.  That means Cerberus gained &euro;85 million in interest alone in 2014.  As things stand, it pays zero tax on that sum because it has an arm's length loan to itself that violates the principles that the Minister, quite rightly, put out after the tax ruling, that economic activity should be taxed here.<\/p> <p>  Nomura has had a conservative &pound;1 billion increase in its asset base.  The amendment, as it stands, will allow Nomura to mark its asset base to the September value thus wiping out &pound;1 billion in capital gains.  Corporates pay capital gains tax of around 25% when one balances everything out.  The amendment will allow Cerberus to wipe out &pound;250 million in capital gains tax that was due to the State.  The amendment will allow the wipe out of tens of millions of pounds a year in corporation tax and dividend withholding tax.  If one rolls that up for ten years the sum will amount to close to &pound;2 billion of gains.  The amendment, as it stands, means Cerberus will walk out of this country having paid no tax on such gains.  I am just referring to Project Eagle.  When one scales it up one starts to get into the tune of between &euro;10 billion and &euro;20 billion.  <\/p> <p>  I am cognisant that the Minister has repeated again today that he is open to my suggestion.  I have to emphasise that the accounting firms, that have an input in the drafting of this amendment were, within 12 hours, sending circulars to their clients saying something like: \"There is nothing to worry about, we will set up arm's length mezzanine financing, we will come in and we will mark to market all of your capitals, and don't worry about all of the capital gains for the past six or seven years as we have already taken care of them for you.\"  As things stand these funds are going to walk out of this country, having made many billions in profits off the backs of people trying to pay their mortgages and businesses trying to pay down their loans, without paying taxes.    <\/p> <p>  I agree with the principle outlined by the Minister that the economic activity must be taxed in this country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#N00200","speaker":"1230"},{"type":"speech","time":1474360200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Deputy, a question please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#N00300","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1474360200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Yes.

The committee has met thus far with a large number of witnesses from various organisations.  I would like the Minister to take us through this year's budget and, in particular, an issue raised by him in his opening remarks, namely, the universal social charge.  First, I would like to give him a flavour of what some of the organisations we met had to say in regard to the phasing out or abolition of the universal social charge.  Professor Alan Barrett of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, said that the USC has many desirable features as a source of revenue, such as progressivity, transparency and stability.  Dr. Tom McDonnell of the Nevin Institute said that the USC has a simple and highly progressive structure and the dismantling or phasing out of it would be regressive and extremely costly.  The European Commission has criticised the move to abolish the USC.  The IMF has called the proposal regressive.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council called it an unrealistic proposal.  In a rare example of agreement, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and IBEC are opposed to the abolition of the USC.  Are all of those experts wrong?  We also learned from a briefing document published via a freedom of information request that officials in the Department of Finance believe abolition of the universal social charge or a phasing out of it to be base eroding, regressive and of little value to many people.  Are the officials in the Minister's Department who wrote that briefing document also wrong?<\/p> <p>  The Minister said that it is not possible now, given the limited fiscal space, to phase out the USC over three years.  The Fine Gael manifesto committed to this being done over five years.  From the Minister's perspective, what is the current position on the phasing out of the USC and the timeframe in this regard?  I referred earlier to the view of all the experts on this issue.  It is a rare example of agreement from so many different diverse organisations.  They are all of the view that it is not wise or prudent to be phasing out this tax at this time.  Given the pressures on public services, does the Minister accept now is the time to re-evaluate the phasing out or abolition of the USC?<\/p> <p>  My next question, which relates to corporation tax receipts, is directed to the Revenue witnesses.  In 2014 and 2015, we experienced a massive increase in corporation tax receipts.  During its appearance before the committee, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council expressed caution in respect of future budgets, in particular any proposed phasing out of taxes, spending and so on based on potentially unrealistic or unsound corporation tax receipts.  That is the opinion of the fiscal council, not mine.  I am seeking the Minister's view as to the sustainability of these corporation tax receipts.  Given we have had serious corporate restructuring that has on the one hand resulted in the boosting of corporation tax receipts and on the other hand a distorting effect on GDP, as happened in 2014 and 2015, are we likely to see more of this in the coming years and is that likely to have a further impact on our GDP figures and also on corporation tax receipts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#O00100","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1474360200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>On the USC and the views expressed by the many distinguished witnesses who have appeared before the committee, their opinions should be valued, as I am sure they are.  There are other opinions as well.  The opinions of the political parties during the election were to the effect that the USC needed to be reduced, that it was an emergency tax introduced at a particular time and that now that the emergency was over, work should continue to phase it out.  Whatever we do in this regard in the upcoming budget is not a first step because reductions in the USC were provided for in the previous two budgets.  Deputy Cullinane will recall that during the election time his party was the only party that was committed to maintaining the USC.  The Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and Labour Party proposals, which were varied but bore a lot of similarities as well, were around the phasing out of the USC.  These were reflected in the programme for Government such that I am not constructing a budget a couple of weeks from a standing start.  The budget will be based on the programme for Government, which sets down the intent of those who adhere to it in respect of USC.<\/p><p> On the phasing out of the USC, we are in the third year of reducing it.  We have committed to anything we do being directed towards reducing the impact on low and middle income earners and continuing that process in subsequent budgets if the Government is still in office.  The reason I reference a period of three years is the commitment given by Fianna F&aacute;il to support the Government over three budgets and then review the position.  I am saying it will not be possible to phase out the USC completely in a three-budget cycle, but it should be possible to phase it out in a five-budget cycle, understanding that after the fifth budget, because of the way in which the tax years are structured, there would still be a tail heading into 2021 which would be eliminated in the course of that year.<\/p><p> On corporation tax receipts, the question on which was addressed specifically to the Revenue officials, there was a spike and at the time nobody could explain why it had occurred.  There are now better explanations, one of which is the corporate sector is more profitable.  As long as it sustains profitability, there will be a strong flow.  The fear expressed last year, that one should not rely too much on them because it might be a one-year spike, has ameliorated somewhat.  It now looks as if corporation tax receipts - there was a 40% jump in the yield - will flow in at a much higher rate than heretofore for a variety of reasons, one being the profitability of companies.  That is not to suggest the yield will not rise and fall with the business cycle and the profitability of companies.  It should be remembered that corporation tax receipts account for about 15% of total revenue, which is very significant.  We are not, by and large, funding through corporation tax receipts.  There is a serious flow of funds, but they are nothing like income tax or VAT receipts.  What I am saying is people should not be fascinated by corporation tax receipts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#O00200","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474360200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Howard like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#P00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474360200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I would like to make a few general comments on the matter, following which I will try to address the specific questions raised.  <\/p> <p>  The performance of corporation tax receipts was stronger than expected in 2015, with total receipts of &euro;6.9 billion in comparison with a figure of &euro;4.6 billion in 2014, which represents an increase of 49%.  Receipts were about 50% ahead of the forecast.  Up to end August 2016, they were once again ahead of the forecast, running at about &euro;3.5 billion, or approximately &euro;500 million or 17.1% higher than the forecast.  Approximately &euro;300 million, however, may have to be refunded later.  This year, excluding the potential for refunds, we anticipate that receipts will be approximately &euro;200 million, or 7%, ahead of the forecast.<\/p> <p>  As members will probably be aware, corporation tax receipts are highly concentrated, with a high proportion coming from the foreign direct investment multinational sector.  In 2015 approximately half of the increased corporation tax receipts came from a small number of companies.  This was attributable to various issues, including - I must be mindful of the need for confidentiality for individual taxpayers - the profitability of some businesses, improved trading conditions and, in some instances, currency fluctuations.  Although corporation tax receipts are concentrated in the multinational sector, it is fair to say the base for the additional corporation tax receipts is relatively broad, with improved receipts from Irish businesses also.<\/p><p>It is not just foreign direct investment companies that have aided matters.  Our indigenous industry has also increased.  A large number of companies have returned to profitability so that is the part of the increase.  Proportionately, it is a smaller part of the yield but I suggest that it is still significant in the long term.<\/p><p> Corporation tax for 2016 was forecast to grow to about 9.7% from 8%.  It was not linked to the potential growth in the economy.  I suggest that corporation tax for this year is likely to be in the region of &euro;6.5 billion, which is about 14% of the total tax take for this year.  That is what we estimate will happen this year.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about the future sustainability of the corporation tax yield.  Predicting the future is difficult and someone would be very difficult if he or she thought he or she knew what the future held.  There is no particular issue that suggests that it will drop but we do not know.  It depends on future profitability.  A small number of companies pay a disproportionately large amount of tax as part of corporation tax so how these companies perform in the future will impact on the future yield and its sustainability.  Another factor is indigenous industry as it returns to profitability.  The long-term effect of that is also very difficult to predict.  I would be cautious.  We have &euro;6.5 billion but I would not like to predict what it will be in the future.  It is there at the moment and we have no reason to think it will change in respect of particular issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Howard","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474360200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Could Deputy Cullinane be brief?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#Q00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1474360200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>It is not about being mesmerised or fascinated by corporation tax receipts.

Our party would agree with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the ESRI and others in terms of concern about a narrowing of the tax base and would retain the USC.  Will the Minister consider or look at the indexation of tax bands, rates and credits in this budget because failure to do that would be a de facto tax increase to Irish taxpayers?  It would be some response to the concerns raised by the Irish Tax Institute paper today, which showed that the real problem is that we are going into the higher rate so early.  Starting with proper indexation would at least allow us overcome some of the difficulties that come with that.  I am keen to hear whether the Minister will consider the indexation of tax bands and social welfare rates, as has been recommended to us during our hearings.<\/p> <p>  I know there is a very extensive debate on the nature of child care support and whether it is targeted.  We would support it on social justice grounds.  I have an interest in terms of the income tax reform papers we presented.  It reminds us that the Government has committed to improve the home carer tax credit to make sure whatever we do in terms of child care does not discriminate and that we are not saying to one class of parents that we do not want them or their parents looking after their children and that we want to get them out of that model.  Whatever about targeted support for child care in a structured facility, will the Minister look to do something concurrently for parents using other models to make sure that whatever the Government does is not discriminatory in respect of certain types of parenting?  <\/p> <p>  We received a very clear presentation from the Climate Change Advisory Council that showed that our current trajectory in respect of climate emissions will see us face a fine of possibly &euro;5.5 billion from Europe.<\/p><p>We are clearly not on track to meet our renewables and emissions reduction targets.  According to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, we will need a threefold increase in investment in the retrofitting of buildings, or a fivefold increase in investment in sustainable transport, if we are to get anywhere near where we need to go.  I do not see any strategic direction in any of the papers towards a low-carbon economy.<\/p><p> The specific issue of local air pollution caused by diesel particulates and nitrous oxide is well presented in the papers, as is the need to remove the perverse incentive in our system towards the sale of diesel vehicles.  Will the Minister consider adjusting VRT and excise rates to target people who are buying new cars?  Will he look to do this in a revenue-neutral way?  I know from past experience that it can be difficult to change tax arrangements if people believe they are being penalised after the fact for decisions they have previously made.  Does the Minister think he will look to introduce measures in the budget to recognise that problem, as set out in the tax strategy group papers?  Does he think he will be able to do this in a revenue-neutral way in order that motorists will accept that the adjustment which needs to be made is being made in a fair way without necessarily punishing them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#R00900","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474360200,"counter":49,"content":"<p>There has never been automatic indexation of tax bands, allowances or credits, or any other part of the tax code in Ireland.  Of course, Ministers take account of various indices when introducing budgetary measures on budget day.  Ministers and their officials, in addition to doing whatever they are claiming to be doing, are conscious that if there is significant inflation in the system, measures compensating for the lack of indexation should be included in the budget.  However, this has never been made automatic, presumably because Governments like to keep policy control of events such as this.  There are times when the fiscal position is so poor that automatic indexation would be a burden on the Exchequer.  The movement towards automatic indexation, as happens in other countries, has not happened in Ireland and I have no proposal to introduce it at this stage.<\/p> <p>  A tax credit for child care payments was considered as part of the work of the interdepartmental working group on future investment in child care.  When the working group published its report in July 2015, it advised against the introduction of a tax credit measure owing to the considerable risk that it would not achieve the policy aim of supporting the affordability of child care.  The working group suggested it was possible that such moneys would be capitalised into the costs facing parents and that it was likely that any scheme that would have a meaningful impact would be very costly.  Policy has moved in a different direction.  The reasons for this can be set out in very simple terms.  Parents on very low incomes who pay no tax would not benefit from a tax break on child care payments.  Couples or mothers paying tax at the standard rate would benefit at the standard rate only.  Better-off individuals on higher incomes who pay tax at the higher marginal rate would benefit at the higher marginal rate.  It is clear, therefore, that an initiative giving tax credits for child care payments as the principal method of delivering affordable child care would fail an equity test very quickly.  In the world in which we live it might also result simply in increases in child care charges.  In such circumstances, the transfer would be to the provider rather than to the person availing of the service.  That has been the considered policy position since 2015.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, is introducing child care proposals - she has published some of them - but they are not tax-based.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about our position on emissions.  The Department of Finance is not the main policy maker in respect of the country's compliance or non-compliance with European rules.  Other Departments are responsible for that aspect.<\/p><p>We can do things around the edges.  I refer to climate-friendly activities, machines, etc.  We can provide for small tax breaks around the edges in the interests of reducing emissions.  This has been done previously.

I think that would give a fair shock to the system because many people have bought diesel cars.  Deputy Eamon Ryan might advise me in this regard in his report.

I will respond briefly to the Minister's answers to the three questions I raised.  On the indexation of social welfare and tax rates, I would argue that the failure to index the tax rates, in particular, would effectively be a tax increase.  Therefore, I think that should be the first priority if changes are being made on the income tax side.  I would make the same argument regarding the indexation of social welfare.  This is a time when the recovery should be for everyone.  I presume we have not indexed anything since the crisis took hold in 2009 or 2010.  At a time of increased revenues, seven or eight years on, it is absolutely appropriate for social welfare and tax credits to be index-linked in recognition of the need for the recovery to benefit everyone.<\/p> <p>  While I absolutely accept the Minister's point about the slight discriminatory mechanisms that could exist if our approach to child care were to be based purely on tax credit changes, I would like to repeat my central question.  When the Minister is considering what to do on the child care issue, will he seek to ensure that nothing which might lead to further discrimination - or any potential discrimination - between different types of parenting will be introduced?  In other words, the State should not take a specific position, even if it might possibly be beneficial for the economy to say we want everyone to work.  Is it not appropriate for the State to say that the manner in which children are raised is an issue for parents to decide on?  The State should not discriminate in favour of one system by treating it as a better system.  Surely that should be decided by parents, rather than by the State through its tax or other support measures.<\/p> <p>  As I have said, I will include the in Green Party's submission its proposals for tax changes.  The Minister is right when he says that the expenditure side can have the most influence on climate policy.  I would argue that this is an issue for every Department and every section of the Government.  The State needs to make a strategic decision on whether it wants to go in a sustainable direction.  At present, it is not going in that direction.  We need something of the scale of what was done by Whitaker and Lemass in previous generations to place our country on a sustainable path.  We are going in the exact opposite direction at the moment.  Just as Whitaker led the change which gave rise to Ireland becoming an open economy, we need the Department of Finance and other Departments to make changes now to put this country on a sustainable path.  That is the way the world is going but we are going in the opposite direction, which is not clever in financial or environmental terms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#T00400","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1474360200,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Does the Minister have a response?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#T00500","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1474360200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I think I have made my point.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, who is a member of the Cabinet, and her Department have primary responsibility for policies in the area raised by the Deputy.  I cannot solve everything through the tax code.  I can make a contribution through the tax code, but the lead role must be taken by the Minister with responsibility for child care.  It is clear from what she has published that she is not moving towards tax-based solutions to this problem.  We all know that child care is extraordinarily expensive and unaffordable for some people.  There is a kind of built-in assumption in the claims about indexation that everybody is happy with the social welfare and tax codes and that these do not need to be reformed.  I do not agree that we have the perfect mechanism and that all we need to do is index and let it off.  Many reforms to the social welfare code could be introduced.<\/p><p>There are also many reforms that could be introduced to the tax code.  Indexation removes flexibility from policy makers to some degree where they are of a mind to reform particular codes.  This is not a simple debate.<\/p><p> Considerable progress has been made in moving towards a sustainable economy.  The economy is growing strongly and it is doing so in a sustainable way.  One of the key economic issues around sustainability, albeit perhaps not one that featured in the Deputy's catalogue of reference points, is to have an economy that is not dependent on one or two sectors.  The growth figures for the past several quarters show the economy is growing across all 12 key economic sectors, which was not the case during the Celtic tiger when growth was built on one particular sector.  This is fundamental to sustainability.  With regard to sustainability in reference to climate change, it is the same word but a different debate.<\/p><p> It is incorrect to state there is no consciousness of building a sustainable economy or that this Government and its predecessor have not been building a sustainable economy.

The result of the presidential election in the United States is unforeseeable at this point and we do not know what changes of policy could occur or what would be the impact if the Republican candidate were to win the contest.<\/p> <p>  Second, there is uncertainty across Europe.  Colleagues in the Eurogroup and ECOFIN have been describing events in their countries.  Europe is beginning to grow again but growth has not been strong and there is a lack of investment throughout Europe.  While quantitative easing has helped, it has not helped as strongly as those who developed the policy anticipated at the point of development.  We also have all the usual problems in north Africa and the Middle East.  The main problems in Europe are low growth, political instability, a migratory problem that has not been resolved, a security problem which breaks out in many of the democracies and various threats externally.  <\/p> <p>  When one brings the issue back home, Brexit is obviously a big issue from our point of view.

We have built this assessment into the figures.  While there will be other consequences, we will not know what they are until the elements of the negotiation between the United Kingdom and European Union fall into place.  We do not yet have a roadmap because the UK authorities have not yet indicated what will be their approach, much less its specifics.  If one set of specifics were to come into place, it would give rise to a set of risks that we would have to measure.  If the UK authorities were to pursue another set of priorities, the risks would be different, however, and we would have to assess what impact they might have on the economy.

We could, for example, include provisions for the future which would act as a form of shock absorber to risk, the proposed rainy day fund being one such example.  This type of fund would help in an uncertain world.  We can also do other things and I am working on what we can do on a macro level on budget day. <\/p><p> Deputy Michael McGrath is correct that it is a difficult world and most of the risks one can see on the horizon are not yet measurable.  What we have measured is a 0.5% projected reduction in GDP for 2017.  This reduction will still leave us with strong growth figures, however, and if we were calculating the fiscal space now, we would be in roughly the same position.  The fact that it is locked in gives us less flexibility to move it around but the same numbers are solid.  There are slight variations right up to budget day and there will be movement on the fiscal space but I do not expect it to be dramatic.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#U00300","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474360200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>The 9% VAT rate on the tourism and hospitality sector is addressed in the tax strategy paper.

An overriding concern would be that we could fall out of step with what the authorities in the United Kingdom are doing.  Our working assumption is that if one were to introduce a tax on sugar sweetened drinks, it would need to be at a material level to have an impact.  If it is at a material level, one is looking at potentially significant discrepancies between here and the North of Ireland.  That would give rise to obvious compliance problems, which would be extremely difficult to deal with in the context of the Single Market.  Both countries are still in the Single Market and one cannot have border controls or checks on movement in it.<\/p><p>Essentially it would in all probability be a self-assessed tax where returns are made on the first supply in the State of the products that are liable to the tax.

I am not talking about consumers going up to buy soft drinks but a grey market could develop with illicit supplies in bulk going into the retail sector.  That would be a very difficult challenge.

Will the Minister comment on the benefits of a reduction in USC and the principle of putting money back into people&rsquo;s pockets?  The USC was a temporary draconian tax introduced to dig us out of a particular financial situation.

There will be nothing in this budget and no separate local property tax amendment Bill being introduced this year because the principal issue was resolved last year.<\/p> <p>  On the USC and marginal rates of tax, the literature would say that once there are high marginal rates of tax, it begins to affect the economy in an adverse way.  The argument then is about what are those levels.  I do not know whether the Deputy ever read Professor Laffer who was a great adviser to President Reagan.  There is something called the Laffer curve.  I am not a disciple of Laffer but some of the things he says are interesting.  If something is taxed at zero there will be no revenue, but if it is taxed at 100% there will also be no revenue.  There must be a sweet point in between where it is possible to maximise the revenue.<\/p><p>Finding that point is a great skill and there are no rules about it.  Many tax experts or economists would say that once one pushes one's tax over 50%, it seems to have some kind of psychological effect on people and that a marginal tax rate where one is taking half of what people earn might be just about manageable, but if one goes beyond that and one is taking in tax more than half of what people earn, then it has an adverse economic effect.  As for where it hurts us, high marginal rates of tax discourage key employees coming with multinational investment into companies that set up in Ireland.  I am talking about foreign nationals coming in.  One aspect they look at is their take home pay and the marginal rates of tax are important in that regard.<\/p><p> The other place where marginal rates of tax are studied carefully is in the context of the young Irish abroad who want to come home.  Committee members will be familiar with the folklore that when the children are about primary school-going age and the eldest is four, the emigrant couple in Australia or the United States think of coming back to Ireland and start running the numbers, but they find they cannot afford it.  One of the reasons they cannot afford it is the marginal tax rate.  I suppose I am talking more anecdotally than giving the committee any proof, but there is no doubt at all that the marginal tax rate has an effect on economic behaviour, on choices and on the labour market.  It is a question of where one pitches it to ensure that one eliminates the worst effects and at the same time protects the revenue.<\/p><p> The marginal tax rate is too high at present.  There was never a policy intent to have it that high by the second last Government.  It was merely that it needed the money and USC was introduced as an emergency tax in an emergency situation.  The reason I am reducing USC rather than income tax is before one starts looking at the income tax code, one should take out the emergency taxes first.<\/p><p> Much of this is theoretical in the context of this year's budget.  We have &euro;330 million or so for tax measures.  Once one takes &euro;1 billion and divides it two-to-one in favour of expenditure, which seemed to be one of the lessons of the election, which lesson is incorporated in the programme for Government, we have reasonably significant resources this year above last year's budget but the bulk of it is dedicated to increased expenditure - the committee can have that conversation with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, tomorrow.  No matter the theory, the affordability of implementing desirable measures will be the principal issue on the tax side in this budget and most of what I would like to do is not affordable.  I do not have the money.<\/p><p> The committee can see it as a new start to a three-year phase of budgets, which Fianna F&aacute;il states it will support.  I do not want to be taking once-off initiatives budget to budget and changing my policy mind in different budgets.  I would like to commence the process in this budget and signal that what we are doing here and now is the way forward, that we will build on this in budgets two and three, and we will see where we are after that.

The Minister said there was no real roadmap in relation to the risk the country faces.<\/p><p>He also stated he wanted to have a low-risk budget.  It is extraordinary that all the representatives of the various interest groups that appeared before the committee, including trade unions and employers, focused on the current very low levels of capital expenditure which are a consequence of the crash of 2008.  Inflation in construction costs is running at approximately 5% and in some cases it is even higher.  There is also a visible slowing down by either the Department of Finance or Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or both in forwarding and commencing construction of key projects such as schools and facilities for older people who may need care.  To give an example, while I am aware that the development of a new purpose-built Garda technical headquarters is the subject of an ongoing legal dispute, the decision to build the facility was taken a long time ago and no moves have been made to commence building work.<\/p><p> If things turn out as projected, and leaving out of account those things the Minister will decide as we approach the budget, public expenditure in the period until 2021 will be potentially lower than in most other European countries.  While this is a matter of statistics, the delay in the capital programme is heartbreaking for many people and deeply disappointing.  In that context, will the Minister confirm that he has abandoned the idea, at least in this year's budget but hopefully permanently, of establishing a rainy day fund?  Why would we start saving billions of euro every year when interest rates are so low that we would not make much from any savings we made and we have, at the same time, a crying need for capital investment?<\/p><p> Public infrastructure in transport and housing is vital if our large cities are to continue to attract multinational companies, which understandably complain about infrastructure in terms of the quality of life of the employees they are trying to attract.  Does the Minister intend to review the public expenditure capital programme before the budget to ensure spending is pitched at a reasonable level and moves towards average European levels as the economy hopefully continues to grow in strength?  Does he also accept that the idea of a rainy day fund is entirely inappropriate in policy terms?<\/p><p> To add to the point made by the previous speaker, the real difficulty with the income tax system is that single people enter the higher rate of tax when their earnings reach approximately &euro;38,000.  Even if it were to take him five years, would the Minister be inclined to move the level at which people, particularly younger people who find the task of buying a house very difficult, begin to move into the higher tax bracket?  I assume he wants younger people to continue to have a capacity to own a home?<\/p><p> To return to the earlier questions asked, I assume the Minister's focus in the area of housing will not be entirely on real estate investment trusts, REITs.

The Minister is better positioned than I am to answer questions on capital expenditure, how it is progressing and whether there are barriers to the system.  All I know is that, as the fiscal space expanded and resources became available, we increased the amount of funds available for the public capital programme from what the level agreed when Deputy Brendan Howlin was Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and Deputy Joan Burton was in government.  Expenditure on that programme, which is to roll out to 2021, has been increased.<\/p> <p>  There is a difference in the manner in which capital expenditure is calculated under the fiscal rules where only one quarter is booked up front.  Deputy Burton can ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform about that tomorrow.  He has a little more leeway on capital expenditure than on current expenditure.<\/p> <p>  The rainy day fund will only arise when we balance the budget and start running surpluses.  It cannot arise this year because we are still borrowing and in deficit.  However, it is proposed to put in place a rainy day fund from around 2018 and I will continue the work being done in the Department on this issue to ensure such a fund is put in place.  One of the things that has bedevilled macroeconomic management in this country is the theory that, regardless of external or domestic circumstances, I will spend it if I have it.  We have all deplored the boom and bust cycle in the economy, which has occurred in every generation and twice in some generations.  All members are familiar with the theory of counter-cyclical interventions, according to which one does not stimulate an overheating economy and one stimulates an economy that is entering recession.  Everybody has known this theory for years but in times of crisis, for example, the crisis that occurred in 2008-09, no money was available for the demand side of the economy.  The purpose of a rainy day fund is to have money in place, which, if spent at the time the surplus accrues, could lead to overheating of the economy.  The fund is used on the day the business cycle goes down and more spending is needed on the demand side.  It would probably be spent on capital.  I will not change the work being done on this matter in the Department.  However, a rainy day fund will not arise until surpluses are recorded in the system.  We believe we will be very close to nominal balance at the end of 2017.  Under the new European rules, a balance is deemed to be plus 0.5%.  It is not balance in the way we would traditionally understand it but it is in accordance with the rules.  <\/p> <p>  A structural balance is more complicated and will probably be achieved in 2018.  All going well, the economy will continue to grow at approximately 3.25% through the forecasting period and surpluses will accrue some time in the course of 2018.  The Minister and Government of the day will then have choices to make.  Will they spend everything they have, use the surplus to reduce taxes or put some of it aside?  I believe it is possible to spend some of it, reduce taxes and put some of it aside, provided one does not try to do everything.  A rainy day fund is a very prudent concept.  The circumstances in which it would be spent would be a matter for the Government of the day.  However, drawdowns should not be automatic but should proceed on the basis of criteria.  We will work on that issue.  That is my position on the matter.

The Minister is essentially talking about taking several million towards the latter end of the capital programme.  I appreciate the Minister's comments about overheating.

I am sure he is.  The Minister said some revisions will take place.  In terms of the financial rules, we are in a German model but we are not Germany.  We all accept that we have to have rules and structures but in terms of the capital investment to provide for growth in the country, a certain amount of leeway is necessary.

In the 2000s, I saw Ireland building the most expensive roads in Europe because there was too much capital being spent.  All that happened was tender prices went through the roof.  I saw us building the dearest schools in Europe because tender prices went through the roof.  It was a transfer of surplus funds from the taxpayer to the developers and builders.  One has to manage capital programmes the same as any other programme and this is one mechanism for managing it.  The Government of the day may decide to do something different but I do not want them to be left with their hands hanging if something unexpected happens.

Is there any scope for a city tax like there is in other European countries based on the nightly value of accommodation?  It would be specifically for Dublin and maybe other cities depending on the growth in the sector but it would keep the 9% rate as it is.  In Holland, they also tax the Airbnb nightly rate.  There are a couple of positives to that.  It may level out the growth throughout the country and not have Dublin running away with itself.

Is there scope there?  Would it be true to say these investment vehicles were established when nobody in Ireland had the money to buy the property and there was stagnation in the market?  Is there scope now to go to a 12.5% rate as opposed to a retrospective change in the tax band?<br\/><br\/>I have written to the Minister before about our VAT bands.  It comes as a surprise to many people that there is a 23% VAT rate on injections in Ireland.  For me, as a medical person, to have a VAT rate of 23% on a preventative medicine like a vaccine seems regressive.  Oral medicines have no VAT on them.  This is a huge issue in the agricultural sector where bulk antibiotics are being put into animal feed.  Taxation needs to gather revenue but also influence behaviour.  To try to influence people's behaviour, I would love to see scope to put a VAT rate on oral antibiotics in light of the huge antibiotic resistance issue we have coming down the line and to remove the 23% VAT rate on vaccines.  For children getting the meningococcal vaccine, it would reduce the cost to parents.  The advantages of immunisation against meningococcal disease in terms of hospital stay time and savings to the State are well documented.  Within the same field, we have a 13.5% VAT rate on barrier contraceptives such as condoms in Ireland.  There is a massive rise in sexually transmitted diseases in the country.  With a nod towards this and preventative health measures, would it be possible to change the 13.5% VAT on condoms to 0% to highlight this very important public health issue?<br\/><br\/>I do not want to go on too much about the USC.  I agree with Deputy Cullinane who has now left.  Pretty much every expert who has come in here has spoken about the broad tax base that the USC created and told us it would not be such a good idea to erode that base.  As somebody who pays a lot of USC, I can understand why many people would like to see it removed from their pay check or reduced over time.  To address the massive hole we have in our pension fund in Ireland, is there any scope to divert a portion of the USC over a period of time over the next few budgets and change it to a PRSI style of tax?  This would cushion against the pension timebomb coming down the road.<\/p><p> My question concerns the 9% VAT rate, the city tax option and the potential tax rate on foreign investment funds at 12.5%.  We could even consider an increased stamp duty for foreign investments coming in.

For example, one can only have two lower rates, so we cannot introduce a 0% or 5% rate for items that we think should be taxed lower.  When we moved from 13.5% to 9% on certain services, activities and goods, that was the second low VAT rate.  It could be moved back up, of course.  There have been a lot of complaints about the price of accommodation, including hotels in Dublin, particularly when key events are taking place.  However, to move it up does not solve that problem, it just adds 4.5% to the cost of the bedroom.  One would get a bit of vengeance but it does not reduce costs.  It is very hard, therefore, to change VAT.<\/p> <p>  We can compare with other countries and see differences, but the key year was 1991.  Anything that was in place before 1991 could continue.

Income tax would be at a higher rate than VAT anyway, but there is something I want to look at in the budget.  One of the reasons, but only one, that the amount of rental accommodation in Dublin has been reduced is that quite a number of rooms that were traditionally rented, maybe for students, have become Airbnb rooms, so there is a transfer from the rental market to the tourist industry.  The numbers are beginning to stack up.  I suggest it is something the committee could have a look at and perhaps suggest ways that we could compensate for the reduction in rooms.  I think that is fairly important.<\/p> <p>  As regards oral medicines and vaccines, I am not familiar with the details, but in general terms there is very little flexibility for varying VAT rates on such things.  We could do a general review of VAT in Ireland but it would be opening up Pandora's box whereby the whole country would want to be on the lower rate.  I am subject to advice on this, but I do not have a ready-made solution of any sort on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Some things are not price sensitive.  People may propose to take such and such an item from 13.5% down to 9%, but some things have no market effect because they are not that price sensitive.  For example, I doubt very much that if contraceptives were moved from the 13.5% VAT rate to the 9% rate, it would change behaviour very much or have a big impact on the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.  Maybe it would, but I doubt it.<\/p> <p>  It is an interesting debate and if the committee wants to make submissions on it to me, members should make them fairly quickly because there are only three weeks left to budget day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#CC00200","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1474360200,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank his officials both from Revenue and the Department in assisting me and my party in preparing our alternative budget.<\/p><p>I know that this is the first time the Minister has appeared before the committee.

For example, in its presentation to the committee, the ESRI stated the argument that a high marginal tax rate affected employment needed to be tested.  There is the counter argument that supporting child care payments could have a better impact on employment creation and the economy.  I will give the Minister some figures.  As we know, by 2021 the USC will be bringing in &euro;5.4 billion.  To provide free child care services 52 weeks of the year, for 50 hours per week, for every child from the age of six months to schoolgoing age would cost &euro;4.1 billion.

However, I do not agree with moving to abolish or reduce it for people on higher incomes and I would like to hear what possible justification there could be for it.  The justification for reducing it for low and middle-income people is the fact that we have chronically high levels of low pay and what I believe is a 30% increase in the number of people on family income supplement.  People at the lower end have been hammered so I agree with giving them relief.  However, I do not agree with reducing the income tax burden via USC or any other means on those earning in excess of about &euro;70,000.  Could the Minister respond to that and tell us what possible justification exists for reducing it for those on higher incomes, given the rate of income inequality?<\/p> <p>  In respect of revenue raising from other sources, as a general point, there is a general recognition that we need funds for capital investment.  There is an investment crisis in vital infrastructure, be it housing, health or education.  There is insufficient investment.  The question is where we get the money from.  I put it to the Minister that the answer to that question lies in the corporate sector and wealth and that this is the area in which we need to tighten up.  Have we not failed disastrously in this area and been brutally exposed by the EU ruling on Apple, the scandal relating to section 110 and the scandal referred to by Deputy Doherty regarding the qualifying investor funds - another scandal that needs to be looked into?<\/p> <p>  We need information on all of these aspects.  How many funds are there?  How many of these qualifying investor funds are there?  We need to know.  How much income has been foregone as a result of the failure to impose a withholding tax on these qualifying investor funds?  How much tax has been foregone because of the failure to apply the normal corporation tax rate to these section 110 companies?  We need every bit of information that Revenue has on the corporate tax heading.  We are getting the information two or three years behind so we are flying blind in discussing these matters.  We need this information.  <\/p> <p>  I am sure Revenue is aware of the comments I made about the deductions and allowances over the past few weeks but if it is not, I will repeat them.  There was a shocking increase in the level of allowances permitted for the corporate sector post-2007.  It jumped by &euro;13 billion in two years.  That is a tax loophole.  My guess is that it relates to Google, Facebook or Apple.  This is a huge jump in allowances.  I cannot believe that this could happen without it being detected.<\/p><p>It took the European Union and some of us contrarians in here questioning these headings to force a serious examination of this.  We are talking about billions upon billions of euro in profits that were being siphoned out of the tax system by the multinationals, with nothing being said.  Was there any discussion about these matters?  Critically, we need to know whether the double Irish is still operating.  Despite the Minister having made public comments to the effect that the double Irish is gone, it is not and all the big offenders are still capable of availing themselves of it.  We need to know whether they are still doing so.<\/p><p> Can we have all the figures that the Minister has and not be two or three years behind in respect of corporate tax?  We need a forensic examination of all the deductions and allowances that are being given to the corporate sector and that allow it to write down the amount of profit that is actually being taxed.  That is where the scandal lies at the back of the Apple story.<\/p><p> Are we now going to calculate the tax liability of all the firms in question from here on according to the decision of the European Union, or are we going to continue to calculate as we have been calculating previously?  I acknowledge that the Minister is appealing the decision but there is now a ruling.  We will see what the outcome of the appeal is.  As those present know, I believe it is absolutely bonkers that the Minister is appealing the decision.

Corporation tax revenue has increased from under &euro;4 billion to over &euro;7 billion.  That is a very significant increase.

Traditionally, we have not been particularly strong in the Revenue Commissioners on the transfer pricing.  It was never particularly an issue because we had a low tax rate.  However, over the past few years we have been increasing the resources we apply to this area.  Certainly in the past three years, the Minister has given us additional resources, for which we are very grateful.  The resources comprise highly skilled individuals.  We have a special unit in our large cases division regarding transfer pricing.  We also have expertise elsewhere in terms of transfer pricing.  Therefore, we are ramping up the activity in these areas.  What we are doing with these resources is ensuring the pricing is based on arm's length pricing mechanisms.  That is our position on royalties.  We are grateful for any additional resources that we can get to apply to this area.  However, it is a highly skilled task and a difficult issue, as we see from examining these matters.  We have been active in this space.  At least in the past three years, we have got dedicated resources into the area.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Apple ruling, I do not want to say much because there are ongoing court proceedings thereon.  I reiterate the position of the Revenue Commissioners on the Apple case.  There was no departure from our perspective in the Revenue Commissioners.  I support this position.  There was no departure from the applicable Irish law by the Revenue Commissioners in terms of Apple.  There was no preference shown in applying that law and the full tax was paid that was due in accordance with the law.  That is the position we have on Apple.  The issue in question is a different issue.  To speak in general terms, the issues concerning Apple relate to branches and how branches are taxed.  The corporation tax law on that is quite clear.  It is in original corporation tax legislation, the Corporation Tax Act 1976.  If one looks back over an even longer period, as I did last week, one notes the first cases that set out the principles in regard to this matter were 1880 cases.  There is a long-established principle as to how these matters are to be dealt with and what the normal practice is in terms of case law and statute law.  That is our position on it.  Obviously, it is now with the courts so it is up to them to make a decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#KK01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Howard"},{"type":"speech","time":1474360200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I ask Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett to conclude his questioning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#KK01200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1474360200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>The problem is that in trying to scrutinise the budget, which is our job, we are flying blind on a number of key questions and under this key heading.<\/p><p>We just have to take Mr. Howard's word on certain things without up-to-date information.  There is speculation about what may be happening under this critical tax heading.  That is unsatisfactory and means that we cannot do our job properly.  That is the bottom line.  I am still not quite sure if it means that we are calculating.  We have not had an answer on the double Irish.  Is it still operating?  Are companies still availing of it and will they be able to avail of it for the next few years?  If we were to calculate the tax liabilities of the offending companies, as the European Union would have wished us to do in the light of its ruling, notwithstanding the dispute about what happened in the past, what would it mean for now, this year and next year?  That question has not been answered.<\/p><p> There is one other thing I will flag because I do not have time to deal with it.  There is an ongoing vociferous campaign by building workers who believe the RCT system is being abused on a rampant scale by building contractors.  I have put various questions to the Minister on the numbers in the construction industry on RCTs which are usually subsequently answered by Revenue.  In one answer I was advised that 35,000 people were on RCTs, but I was then told in another that there were 70,000 people on them, which is quite a big difference.  As only 130,000 people work in the construction sector, it means, according to one of the figures, that two thirds of them are self-employed.  I do not believe that for one minute.  We then discover that virtually nothing is coming back under that tax heading.  In some years there is a minus figure, but overall there is almost nothing, which suggests there is absolute rampant abuse of the bogus self-employment RCT system.  I do not believe we are taking seriously the allegations that are being made consistently.  The dogs on the street in the construction industry know that this is going on and still we do not seem to be doing anything about it.<\/p><p> I will flag one further issue.  The Unite trade union, in particular, and some of the other unions have highlighted the very low levels of employers' PRSI as one of the big deficits in the tax system in terms of having a sustainable tax base.  We have much lower levels of employers' PRSI than in most of the rest of Europe.

If the Deputy was one of the partners in the case of a young couple thinking of buying a house and if the prospect of getting a big chunk of money was held out to him, he would probably defer his plans to buy.  I did not want to disrupt the market.  To help ensure there would not be market disruption, we said it would be backdated to the date of that announcement.  I am still reluctant to give the details and even though there are only three weeks remaining to budget day, I do not want people who have paid deposits to pull back from purchasing.  Whatever we do will be retrospective.  We have problems enough with supply without creating some kind of hiccup in the market by announcing a help-to-buy scheme prematurely.<\/p> <p>  Second, anything we are doing is with the full knowledge of the Central Bank.  It knows exactly what I have in mind and it approves of it.  The Deputy will see what is proposed on budget day when we will give the full details.  I think it will be a pretty good scheme.  We have to do things and we cannot nail things down 100%.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to brining the VAT down from 13.5% to 9%.  I got no advice from anywhere to do that.  It was a political decision by the Government but it took a tourist industry that was on the ground and put it back up on its feet, as it were.  The same happened when we abolished the travel tax at a cost of &euro;37 million.  More than 2 million extra people have been flown into the country by Ryanair and Aer Lingus.  There are things one has to do.   Why have Ministers and Government if everything is based on the best opinion of officials?  There has to be a situation where Ministers take political initiatives and hold themselves responsible and accountable for them.  Obviously some things do not work and other things work and we try to evaluate them as best we can in advance to make sure there are many more pluses than minuses.  However, with respect to anything one does on the property side, be it introduce a grant scheme or a tax break or whatever, there is no doubt it will have a possible price effect.  Once more money is put into the system and if more money is available and more purchasers with money are available, there is a temptation for small builders to increase the price if they think they can get it.  However, many small builders would say that what they need now is a price increase because they cannot deliver the supply at current prices.  It is quite complicated, and I am sure we will have a full debate on it, but the Central Bank is in the frame.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016092000002#PP00100","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1474360200,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Perhaps some of the distance between us is the Taoiseach's constant explanations and praise of the new politics, much of which includes total frankness.

The development of this committee and the Department was a response by elected representatives to issues raised prior to the general election.  We need to have a sustainable rural society where people can live, have leisure time and educate themselves without feeling the need to leave the areas.  We need to build the areas and make them stronger.  To do this we need infrastructure.  We also need services such as Garda stations, schools and post offices and water and sewage services.  I hope we have a good discussion and that all of the key issues are brought before us.  I call the representatives of Belturbet municipal district council to make their statement and we will proceed to the other councils.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092000002#H00200","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474377300,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I am a director of services at Cavan County Council.  I thank the committee for the invitation to come before it.  The document we have submitted outlines in five sections issues of regional development, with particular reference to environmental designations with sustainable development as an underlying theme.  I am very mindful of time.  I will set out the context for County Cavan and our perception of environmental designations.  I will refer to enterprise, tourism and broadband in towns and issues specific to the municipal district.<\/p> <p>  County Cavan has a population of 73,000 people.  During the most recent intercensal period it received the second highest increase in population.  It is very much a high-growth area.  Traditional economic sectors include indigenous enterprise, building, engineering, food and agribusiness and we strongly assert it is a county with a strongly embedded entrepreneurial culture.  It is very much a county which is independent in thinking and outward looking.<\/p><p> Regarding environmental issues and designations, the map that I have supplied shows that the environmental designations, be they special protection areas, special areas of conservation, natural heritage areas or Natura 2000 areas, are predominantly centred in west Cavan in what we refer to as the Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark or the municipal district of Cavan-Belturbet.  Positive and negative points could be made about designations.  In terms of negative issues or our concerns, there is no question but that designations can add costs to planning permissions, area projects and road projects, for example, the Belturbet bypass.  While the bypass was a successful project, its cost and the length of time taken to develop it were impacted negatively by a designation.  There can be a public perception that an area of high designation is not somewhere one would want to build.  While national policy is to encourage the use of renewable energy, designations can be a disincentive its development.  As to the advantages, we strongly assert that designations protect the environment, address invasive species, which are of increasing concern, and tourism and its development in high-designation areas are served by proper designation of environmental concerns.<\/p><p> I will take the committee through some of the regional development issues in Cavan.  In terms of road infrastructure, 5% of our roads are national primary and secondary routes, meaning that our infrastructure is regional road based.  We have no rail network.  While our local authority has maintained our county road maintenance fund, there is a significant reduction in non-national roads funding and a concern locally that a deterioration in our road network may occur in future.  Cavan once had the negative reputation of having a poor road network.  We do not now, but we do not want to see that reputation returning.<\/p><p> On enterprise, Cavan has a strong entrepreneurial culture.  Agriculture, engineering and building are important.  Some parts of our county are very accessible from Dublin at an hour and a half from this building to Virginia or, possibly, Cavan town, which is good.  Other parts are not so accessible.  There is tourism potential, a high quality of life and a low cost base.  We are strong on the food front.  The annual Taste of Cavan event attracts more than 35,000 people and involves people like Mr. Neven Maguire, Mr. Richard Corrigan, Mr. Gear&oacute;id Lynch and several others promoting Cavan publicly.  It is a strong local authority event.  The Action Plan for Jobs proposes 28,000 jobs for the Border region.  Our bottom line is that, in order to achieve that objective, roads, broadband and water infrastructure need to be improved in Cavan.<\/p><p> Regarding tourism, we are an increasingly popular destination, with 90,000 overseas visitors in 2016.  The Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark is a good example of environmental designation preservation and tourism.  It is the only cross-border geopark in the world.  It is a co-operative project between Fermanagh and Omagh District Council and Cavan's local authorities.  It is important at a political level, but also in terms of preserving the area surrounding the Marble Arch Caves and the Cavan Burren Park, which is in Blacklion.  The Cavan Burren Park is attracting up to 30,000 visitors per year.  Three years ago, it was only attracting a few hundred people.  In this, one sees significant benefits accruing from environmental promotion and preservation.<\/p><p> There is nothing in my presentation with which members are not familiar.  The national broadband plan needs to be rolled out to develop the county.  Most of our county is in the amber area, which is the Government-supported area.  Broadband is a fundamental factor in developing micro-enterprise in Cavan.<\/p><p> Our chief executive and elected members have prioritised town teams.  We are establishing a team in each town, as Deputy Smyth is well aware.  We aim to establish 19 separate teams in all towns and villages.  Each town will have discretionary funding of a certain level - it will not be enormous money - to carry out works and try to turn itself around.  It is a bottom-up project that we are rolling out.  Cavan, Virginia and Cootehill have started and discretionary funds have been allocated.  I might depart slightly on the Cavan-Belturbet municipal district and say that infrastructure and accessibility to the rest of the island are important.  Blacklion, where my colleague, Councillor Feeley, is from, is close to an hour from Cavan.  That is a significant distance from the capital.<\/p><p> The EPA guidelines on the treatment of effluent from domestic buildings pose a significant issue in Cavan.<\/p><p>We have heavy clay soils.  The EPA code of practice, which is mandatory, could pose a significant disincentive to west Cavan's population if further research is not conducted and environmentally sensitive ways of treating effluent are not identified and rolled out.  Rural depopulation in west Cavan is significant.  This is an important cross-party concern among all members of Cavan County Council.<\/p><p> As to the political constituency, the division of County Cavan into two separate lots is, to put it mildly, unpopular.  Cross-party support for the constituency's restoration is strong.<\/p><p> Cavan as a county has considerable development potential, but it requires additional roads, tourism and broadband investment.  As a Border county, Brexit is a source of concern.  Any devaluation in currencies could have a significant impact.  There is anecdotal evidence at a tourism level that Brexit is already having an impact on some providers.  Targeted investment to improve connectivity and support micro-enterprise is needed.  Environmental designations, if properly managed as in the case of our geopark, can be an advantage to tourism promotion and environmental protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474377300,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I might ask the delegates from Connemara municipal district council to proceed.

I am the Cathaoirleach of the Connemara municipal district in County Galway.  My fellow councillors are Thomas Welby, Eileen Mannion and Tom Healy and our director of services for roads is Mr. Liam Gavin.  We are here to discuss the general effects that designated areas are having on the development of infrastructure such as roads.<\/p> <p>  In Connemara, we have a case study in the N59, the main artery connecting Galway city and Clifden.  The majority of the road is of a poor standard and is urgently in need of upgrading.  It is considered to be the economic lifeline for Connemara in terms of regional and local development and its upgrading and improvement are key objectives in the county and regional development plans.<\/p> <p>  The road's upgrade was split into two sections.  The first was a 15 km stretch from Maam Cross to Oughterard.  This section was granted planning permission pending approval by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, of the method statements submitted by Galway County Council.  A method statement is the blueprint showing how construction work will be carried out.  In this case, the NPWS wanted to see how Galway County Council would carry out these works without affecting the pearl mussel.  The council submitted its method statements more than 18 months ago.  For some reason, however, the NPWS has failed to accept them.  This is not rocket science.  The greatest concern is that silt would contaminate a local waterway.  This would not be difficult to address.<\/p> <p>  The second section was from Maam Cross to Clifden, stretching approximately 30 km.  It was refused because some of it would have gone through designated special areas of conservation, SACs.  The problem in Connemara is that 58% of our land is designated as an SAC, special protected area or natural heritage area.  With such constraints, it is practically impossible to build a new road or upgrade an existing one without impacting on a designated site.<\/p> <p>  Galway County Council, through its planning proposals for the upgrading of the N59, is offering the solution with the least impact on the designated lands.  The impact is minuscule, as almost all of the construction work would take place on line on the existing road and only a small percentage would take place off line for realigning some dangerous corners.  This is a national secondary route that is in urgent need of repair.  We should not find ourselves in a situation in which such a minor section of designated land can delay a vital project.<\/p> <p>  There is a similar situation with the R336 in south Connemara.  Several routes are proposed for the new road from Barna to Rossaveal, but the most preferred one goes through designated lands.  This route would have the least impact on the community, but we cannot even consider it because we know it will not happen, given that it goes through designated lands.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, people come second place to birds, bats, snails and plants when we all could and should share the same space with a little careful planning.<\/p><p>In fact, the upgrading of the N59 could only have a positive effect on the environment.  Currently, all the surface residue from tyres, oil and other chemicals flows freely off the surface of the N59 during periods of rain and into the drains that feed into the habitat of this pearl mussel.  With the new road, oil and residue catchment lagoons would be built which would stop this from happening, therefore improving the water quality for all aquatic life.<\/p><p> It is not just the environmental aspects that we must take into consideration when trying to build or upgrade roads through designated land.  There are also huge time and cost constraints associated with trying to deliver such projects in those areas.  There are very large costs in formulating environmental impact statement, EIS, reports and other associated reports.  There are also huge extra costs because of the extra time required to complete a project under the environmental constraints attached to a job such as this.<\/p><p> What alternatives do we have?  Unfortunately, in Connemara we do not have many alternatives.  The one being offered to us at present is that we resurface the existing road.  That will only have a limited shelf life, due to its boggy nature.  This is basically throwing good money down the drain.  There is also the danger of putting a good surface on a road with dangerous corners.  Speed will increase and, as a result, the risk of accidents will also increase.  There have been too many accidents already on this road, with several of them leading to deaths.  All we seek is a safe road that is built for purpose, and this should be well achievable even going through designated land.<\/p><p> We have compiled some recommendations which we have provided to the members of the committee.  I will elaborate on them, if possible.  The first is that there should be a structured system with a clear timescale put in place for decisions on method statements.  In this regard there should be more and better engagement with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, An Taisce and other bodies at pre-planning stage so we can determine before going to the planning stage, and wasting money on EIS reports and so forth, whether the job can proceed.  Galway County Council in this case submitted eight method statements to the NPWS 18 months ago and to date only two of those have been agreed.  It is unacceptable that the NPWS can be allowed to have a seemingly unlimited amount of time to decide on these method statements.  A timeframe must be introduced.  We cannot leave it open-ended.  That does not work.<\/p><p> Second, a thorough investigation of the NPWS should be carried out to ascertain whether it has the necessary resources and qualifications to conduct the scientific oversight of this project.  We see how it has taken so long for the NPWS to respond with its observations on the method statements.  That does not make sense.  The only conclusion we can arrive at is that perhaps the service does not have the resources, qualifications or staff required, or perhaps there is another reason it has taken so long.  Unfortunately, there is also the possibility that it does not wish to see any improvement in Connemara.<\/p><p> Third, a national policy should be introduced for the oversight of any projects seeking planning in designated areas.  This is in the interest of fairness and transparency.  In other parts of the country there was no problem with infrastructure going through designated sites, but in Connemara we appear to be caught by extreme constraints and we are going nowhere.  In calling for a national policy to be introduced, we seek something that is transparent and in which everybody is treated the same, unlike now where one county can get its plans developed without a problem while we do not because we have a different personality, perhaps, who is conducting the business in our county.  That is not fair, so we call for a policy to be introduced on that.<\/p><p> The N59 is vital infrastructure for the economic growth of Connemara, so I hope the committee will give serious consideration to the recommendations we have put before it today.  I thank the committee for its time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092000002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Thomas","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474377300,"counter":244,"content":"<p>M&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas.

I wish to express my thanks, on behalf of the Kells Municipal District, for the invitation to attend the meeting and for the opportunity to make a presentation to the committee on the issues that are prevalent in the rural district of Kells.<\/p> <p>  Kells Municipal District is located in north County Meath and is predominantly a rural area.  Kells is the largest town in the area, with a population of 2,208.  The municipal district covers an area of 817 square kilometres with a population of just over 31,500, as recorded in the 2011 census.<\/p><p>It is considered to have a relatively young population, with 27% in the zero to 18 years age group.  Kells and Navan municipal districts are considered to be significantly more disadvantaged than other municipal districts in Meath.  The members of the committee will have received a written submission from the Kells Municipal District members, but I will summarise the predominant issues that are affecting all communities in the municipal district.<\/p><p> Poor broadband access is a major issue and has the potential to limit education, employment, economic and social opportunities.  Greater emphasis must be given to transportation issues, including availability and cost.  This is especially important in the context of the closing or downgrading of services available locally.  Given the reliance on the road network, with road lengths of 1,192 km in the Kells Municipal District and 933 km of those classified as local roads, funding for ongoing maintenance of this network becomes critical.<\/p><p> There is also the issue of the proximity of education and training facilities.  Accessing these facilities currently requires a great deal of effort and access to the limited transportation options available.  Kells Municipal District has the highest level of low education and the lowest level of high education, as is shown in the 2011 census.  There must be access to additional resources in schools.  The second level school in Nobber village is designated as disadvantaged and therefore attracts some extra resources.  However, it is believed that additional resources are required in feeder national schools, given that by the time the children reach second level they have not received the additional support they require.<\/p><p> Recreational facilities for younger people are required.  It is the opinion of the municipal district that there must be greater focus on young people aged between 12 and 18 years.  There are very few facilities or activities for teenage groups and access to activities and events can limit participation.  Funding opportunities for these facilities are limited.<\/p><p> On the role of the family in the community, due to the lack of opportunities and the need for family members to travel outside of the municipal district for education or work, with many young people relocating to other parts of Ireland or emigrating, there is a loss of social capital and a break-up of family life and local community cohesion throughout the municipal district.<\/p><p> With regard to isolation and mental health issues, according to the 2011 census 12% of the population of Kells Municipal District is aged more than 65 years.  That is the highest rate in County Meath.  Many men and women in this category live alone, but it is not just the older generation that lives alone or is alone for most of the time.  Members will agree that this leads to a feeling of isolation and poor mental health.<\/p><p> According to the 2011 census, 12% of the population in the Kells Municipal District has a disability.  Given the rural nature of the district and the potential reliance on transport services, it is essential that this group of society is provided for and that services are available to ensure that these people are able to participate in and contribute to the community as they would wish.<\/p><p> In summary, our opening statement gave a consideration of rural Ireland.  It is important that Government policies are rural proofed to ensure that they support the long-term sustainable development of rural Ireland.  We will support the committee in its endeavours to promote any initiatives which will help to achieve this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092000002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Cassidy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474377300,"counter":247,"content":"<p>We will now take questions from the members of the committee.

With regard to regional rural development and special designated areas, and I refer specifically to west Cavan in terms of de-population which might not be attractive for investment, what can we do at a national level to change that situation?  Is the special area designation having the impact, as we have heard, on Galway with regard to that kind of development, when one talks about the unattractiveness of population decrease with regard to development?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092000002#N00300","speaker":"1271","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474377300,"counter":250,"content":"<p>There is certainly an argument to say that environmental designations can preserve a pristine environment and in Cavan we would attempt to market our environment as a very high quality place in which to live and work.  That does not do away with the deficits, but if one is looking at the new economy the roll-out of high-speed broadband in rural Ireland would be a game changer for many businesses.  It would enable many small businesses to locate themselves in rural Ireland and it would give entrepreneurs the opportunity to base themselves there.  As it is, there is anecdotal and hard evidence that businesses are leaving places like Cavan to go to larger population centres on the basis of broadband alone.  The rapid acceleration of the national broadband programme would be an opportunity for new enterprise and development opportunities.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has rightly spoken about Brexit.  Up to the point of Brexit, the growth of the agriculture and food sector would have been very significant in Cavan, so obviously this House needs to keep an eye on how we can influence that to make sure we can mitigate the Brexit effects on what is a growth industry.  Aside from that, in my opinion, a re-brand of the central corridor of the country for tourism would be a significant action.  Ireland has had great success with the Wild Atlantic Way and in Dublin.  I know that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has plans with regard to it but it needs to be backed up with a very strong investment programme, at both capital and promotional levels, to market the central aisle of the country, of which Cavan will form part, from the point of view of tourism.  There is significant heritage, cultural and waterways potential in those areas.  I suggest that this would be a priority investment for any administration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092000002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1474377300,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Doyle very much.

Anecdotally there have been reductions in total funding of anything up to 60% or 70% of funding which the local authority has at its disposal, be it the council's own funding or departmental funding.  Cavan's local authority has maintained its county road fund which is our own fund at its level, or thereabouts, to maximise whatever funding comes our way from the Department.  We have included figures which show reductions of that magnitude in the period from 2005 to 2015.  There are reductions from &euro;23 million down to as little as &euro;12 million in total non-national roads funding.  This is very significant.<\/p> <p>  I would bring members back in their recollection of Cavan which was once regarded as a county with very poor road infrastructure.  Now it has an excellent road infrastructure but it is reaching a point where, by virtue of broken maintenance cycles, we could end up having difficulties in the non-national road infrastructure.  In a county which is predominantly based on non-national roads, that is crucially important.  It would be remiss of me to not mention the fact that from O'Connell Bridge as far as Aghalane Bridge on the Border, every single town is bypassed apart from Virginia.  The bypassing of a town like that would provide access to an entire swathe of the county, from as far away as where my colleague is from in the Cavan-Belturbet district up as far as Blacklion.

Reference was made to places being attractive areas in which to live.  West Cavan, and indeed the entire county of Cavan, is a very attractive place to live but every impediment possible is put in our way to allowing those communities to survive and progress.  My colleague Mr. Doyle referred to the EPA guidelines.  The guidelines are another example of how half of the county has been sterilised when it comes to planning applications for permission to allow people to provide their own homes.  This is having a huge impact.  It means that GAA clubs are no longer able to field teams.  While we have already had significant investment in the provision and improvement of primary schools they are now facing closure in the not too distant future because the new families are not coming in.  People are not able to provide their own homes, for themselves, in the places where they want to live.  Surely we can accept the advice from many architects and engineers where there are solutions that would provide very effective treatment of effluent from homes.  Yet the EPA seems to be unwilling to look at the guidelines it has put forward and make provision for those types of treatment systems.  It is just another example of the lack of support, and indeed the impediments that are put in place, for rural communities to sustain themselves or to allow them to build a critical mass of population to make the areas more attractive economically thus allowing small indigenous business to survive within a county such as our own.  If IDA Ireland was referred to I do not believe that IDA Ireland knows where Cavan is.  It is not that long ago since IDA Ireland was planning to sell its property in Cavan town.  Thankfully that was stopped.  However, IDA Ireland does not seem to want to take a progressive approach and make provision for business to set up there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092000002#P00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Paul Feeley"},{"type":"speech","time":1474377300,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Chairman I have one final question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092000002#P00200","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1474377300,"counter":256,"content":"<p>The Deputy has one more minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092000002#P00300","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1474377300,"counter":257,"content":"<p>If we go back to yesterday's presentation and with regard to IDA Ireland, it says there will be a push now for regional development and it is going to start looking outside the main cities.

There is no way one can overestimate the damage being done by the over-concentration of economic activity and infrastructure in one small space on the east coast, to the detriment of the rest of the State.  That is damaging for people living in Dublin also because it means that schools and services which people need become far more difficult to access while there are whole sections of the rest of the State becoming de-populated.  This leads to a huge social deprivation.  I do not believe that people are fully aware of the levels of social deprivation and poverty which exist throughout the country in rural Ireland as a result of that.

I will pass it around when I am finished.  I am going to read the committee a number of excerpts from it.  This document is the complete amount of what he said on the day.  Mr. Warner began by saying that it was important to note that the proposal is to upgrade an existing main road using almost entirely the same footprint and drainage channel.  He said that it would exchange the roadside drains, at least in part, with more modern ones designed with the knowledge of the need of aquatic species such as salmon and freshwater pearl mussel.  He also stated that the proposed land take of 0.007% of the SAC was clearly an insignificant proportion.  He finished by saying that it was reasonable, therefore, to conclude that, once constructed, the new road would be better for nature conservation that the current one.  In the context of the works programmes, he said that they were well-established engineering precautions and that there were no reasons to question their efficacy.  Mr. Warner stated that the detail contained in the document submitted in support of the application was impressive and professional and that it was clear that the developer took these issues seriously.  This was said by a representative of the National Parks and Wildlife Service when he was at the planning aural hearing.  He finished his closing statement by noting that the National Parks and Wildlife Service found no reasonable probability of significant damage from the development.  He said that since then, he had listened to all the submissions at the hearing and had heard nothing that would make him modify his original position.<\/p><p>Effectively, the regional director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service was at the planning application in 2012 and those were his submissions in respect of it.

It is totally unsustainable to wait 18 months for the reports to even be acknowledged, not to be told that there are issues with the reports, but simply for them to be acknowledged.

We will be producing a report to see what learning has emerged from that.  We are certainly trying to emulate other locations, such as Westport, that are models of town design.  I know that officials and elected members have visited Westport.  We are looking at progressing a town design statement as well in order to improve that.

Our problem in Kells municipal district is with funding.  The problem throughout rural Ireland, I would say, is the lack of funding that we receive relative to the major cities.  Of the 31 local authorities, Meath County Council has the lowest expenditure <i>per capita<\/i>of any local authority.  The gap between the city and rural areas is vast.  For example, on the revenue account of 2014 of the local authorities - nothing to do with the capital account - there was a surplus in Dublin City Council of &euro;28 million and in Fingal County Council of &euro;16 million.  That is the accumulated surplus for one year.  In Meath County Council, we have a deficit of &euro;3.5 million.  We have brought that down from &euro;8 million in recent years with a major struggle.  The impact that lack of funding is having on the development of the Kells municipal district in particular is devastating.<br\/><br\/>We have heard about the roads and I am delighted to hear that the roads in Cavan have improved to the extent that they have.  Unfortunately, in north Meath we now have the worst roads because of a complete lack of funding.  We collect motor tax from of &euro;53 million per year from motorists who are resident in Meath.  We receive funding of approximately &euro;12 million to &euro;13 million back to maintain the roads throughout the county.  Bear in mind, as a previous speaker already stated, that over 31% of those roads are in the Kells municipal district area.<br\/><br\/>Some of the policies that have been driven by the Oireachtas sound great.  For example, the Kells municipal district - which is basically north Meath - was added to the map of the EU regional aid approximately two and a half years ago for a five-year term.  We have not received a single penny or job out of that.  Colouring in a map for us has done nothing.  As a result of the fact that we are on the map in question, the Government is now allowed to designate strategy and incentives towards those EU regional aid areas.  However, it is not being done.  The fact that we have been coloured in on a map, with which there was great fanfare about two and a half years ago and which we were delighted to get in north Meath, has produced nothing on the ground.

We are here today because of our absolute frustration with the lack of progress in developing the upgrade of the N59, which is the main artery through north Connemara and into Clifden.  While 58% of Connemara is designated, we do not have an issue with this as the importance of protecting the environment is acknowledged by the people living in the area.  However, we wish to coexist with the environment and to be able to develop our main infrastructure in particular.  Clifden is 80 km from the nearest acute hospital in Galway.  Consequently, someone in Clifden who experiences a heart attack, a stroke, a serious road traffic accident or any other medical emergency must, if he or she gets in a car, travel for 80 km to get there.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has admitted the road is substandard, which is why we have appeared before the committee.  While we have no problem with designations, we wish to coexist with them.  Tourism is a critical industry for the area.  The witnesses from County Cavan mentioned a figure but last year in Connemara, Kylemore Abbey and gardens had 300,000 visitors, while Connemara National Park had 169,000 visitors.  At some point in August this year, Kylemore Abbey was obliged to close its gates because of the numbers visiting it.  However, people are being expected to travel on a substandard road to these destinations.  The businesses in Connemara have been struggling throughout the recession to survive.  They have fought to remain open, have cut costs and have kept on their staff.  However, they are now concerned that with the lack of progress on the upgrade of the N59, their businesses will not survive and people will not come to the area.  The Wild Atlantic Way has been a huge success and has increased visitor numbers but we must have in place the basic infrastructure to maintain our communities, which are extremely important.<\/p> <p>  We mentioned population and in the preliminary figures on rural decline released from the last census, the population of Clifden has declined by 17.9%, that is, has fallen from 2,613 people in 2011 to 2,145 in 2016, which represents a loss of 468 people.  This is a huge number of people for an area to lose and Clifden is in the top ten areas for population loss nationwide.  This loss will result in reduced school numbers and reduced numbers of people using local services or shopping in the towns.  I note that among the surrounding villages, the populations of Letterfrack, Ballyconneely, Leenane and Renvyle have decreased by 28%, 15%, 15% and 8%, respectively.  The population is declining all around us and we are fighting to survive.  We need an upgrade of our road and seek positive engagement with the National Parks and Wildlife Service to deliver our infrastructure.  We respect the environment and wish to work with it but we must coexist to continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092000002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Mannion"},{"type":"speech","time":1474377300,"counter":291,"content":"<p>An bhfuil ceist an-ghairid ag an Seanad&oacute;ir?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092000002#U00400","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1474377300,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I seek a response on the Brexit question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092000002#U00500","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474377300,"counter":293,"content":"<p>Brexit obviously is of particular concern to Blacklion, where I live, as well as to the entire Cavan-Belturbet municipal district.

Admittedly, there were issues regarding the taxation of workers living on one side of the Border versus the other.  As a result of the proposed Brexit, a halt has been put to many funding streams to which we as a local authority had been looking from peace and reconciliation funding and all of that.<\/p> <p>  As for people and their day-to-day lives in these communities, agriculture already has been affected.  Many businesses which had plans for development have frozen those plans because they do not know whether their catchment area will be able to access them in a post-Brexit scenario or what will be the implications of the Border for the movement of people, goods and services.  Situations have already arisen concerning people who had been planning to buy property on one side of the Border.  For instance, my home village of Blacklion is a naturally convenient place for someone who wishes to commute to Enniskillen to work as it is only 20 minutes' away.  I already am aware of people who had been thinking of buying property there to live in that village but who have now decided against it because they are concerned there may be issues with them working in Enniskillen in a couple of years' time, depending on what Brexit is doing.

Is there a logjam of some sort in the NPWS in Galway?  Is there a lack of qualification or understanding as to what is required?  Unless I am mistaken, Mr. Warner's report dates back six years to 2010 and the project has not moved forward.  The next stretch of road includes Kylemore Abbey and approaches the high-tourism area of Clifden and towards Rosleague and Leenane.

My concern is Mr. Warner has moved on but we do not know and are at a loss as to whether it is a breakdown in the system within the National Parks and Wildlife Service and that it lacks the personnel and professional people to do it or whether people are opposed to the project.  Our recommendation is there should be a structured system with a clear timescale put in place for decisions on method statements.<\/p> <p>  As I stated, if someone is given a report seeking his or her input, it is completely unacceptable if that person has not come back after 18 months.

There are other issues in respect of designations and there is a cumulative effect on various projects.  If members can imagine that 58% of Connemara is designated, a 15 km zone has been put in place on top of that.  If one carries out a development within 15 km of a designated area and even if one is not within that designated area, one must prove the development will not have an effect on the designated site.<\/p><p>Effectively, what we want is meaningful discussion.  With regard to Mr. Warner, 0.007% was taken away from the SAC designation and another 213 acres were designated in Connemara in 2016.

The Clifden arts festival is taking place at the moment and there are huge numbers there but, come November, December, January and February, the area is very quiet.

Whether sterling is strong or weak, people in that part of Cavan go into Enniskillen to a greater or lesser extent.  We are engaging with Fermanagh and Omagh District Council on an ongoing basis in regard to the Marble Arch Caves geopark.

Some years ago, I would not have done that, for different reasons.  Many Border roads were closed before the peace process and, thankfully, all of them reopened.  We cannot realistically expect all of them to be manned if we go back to a very hard border.  Communities had been making up for the poor relations and division which had been imposed as a result of partition and the Troubles, and they were coming to terms with that and getting to know their neighbours again.  We are now looking at a scenario where, through no wish of the people on this island, the Border is being reimposed in the worst possible way.<\/p><p>It is also important to put on record that, over the years, the Border has been a blockage to investment and development throughout that region of the country.  The PEACE funding put in place was supposed to be additional to expenditure which we might have normally expected from either the Administration north of the Border or from our own Government.  In reality, it was used to replace the share we should have been getting to make up for the historic deficiency.

In the coming months, this committee has to address the issues of rural infrastructure, the creation of jobs and the provision of adequate services in rural Ireland.  On the infrastructure front, we need to bring fibre to every house and business in rural Ireland.  I find it extraordinary that Eir can provide fibre to homes in rural areas, including in the area where I live, which is very rural.  This means the total national subsidy needed for fibre is very small.  I believe 30 Mbps is ridiculous in this day and age.  We need mobile services, we need roads and we need jobs.<\/p> <p>  I do not intend to focus on that today, however.  The initial request for a meeting with this committee came from the Connemara councillors.  There is an immediate job to be done.  I would like to compliment the councillors and officials from Galway County Council on the rather stark submission they have made available.  This committee deals with arts, heritage, rural, regional and Gaeltacht development and affairs.  The parent Department is the Department of Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.  This comes to the nub of the challenge we face, which has been raised by the councillors from Connemara.  It is that the Department which has the responsibility for regional, rural and Gaeltacht affairs - let us remember large parts of the area of Connemara we are talking about are Gaeltacht areas - is the very same Department that is holding up the development of the road to Connemara.<\/p> <p>  It is a clear responsibility for this committee to try to find out from the Department how it can justify holding up the development of a key piece of infrastructure.  This is not for some private person's benefit; it is public infrastructure.  The further parts of Connemara are over 100 km from Galway city and we basically have a tarred-over track to the city.  Years of work have been put in by various people, including myself, to get it designated under Transport 21 and to get an end-to-end development plan that would provide a road to minimum national standards for national secondary routes.<\/p> <p>  I read the submission from Galway County Council.  I will come shortly to the practical part of what we do now, because it represents great to talk about the challenge but we need solutions to that challenge.  Before dealing with that, I would like to say that while we must preserve the natural heritage, there will be bogs and there will be other natural heritage even if that were lost in Connemara.<\/p><p>However, if the Irish language is to die as a community language, it will, since it is not spoken on any other part of this planet as a community language, be gone from the face of the earth forever as a community language.  Parts of the areas most synonymous with the most vibrant Gaeltacht communities - Carna, Cill Chiar&aacute;in, Rosmuc and Camus - are serviced by this road.  It is ironic in 2016, some 100 years since the Rising, and in view of the fact that P&aacute;draic Mac Piarais had his house in Rosmuc, that the Department responsible for heritage and the Gaeltacht cannot seem to strike a balance here.<\/p><p> The second point, which I believe is quite chilling, is that everybody knows that if one builds a road, it is actually better for the ecology, not worse.  The run-off from the current road, including from tyres and everything else, goes straight into the local streams and can attack the pearl mussel.  The only challenge we face is how to build the road without doing damage.  I do not believe it is beyond the wit of engineers to design a system, as fail-safe as any human system can be, that will allow the road to be built without destroying the pearl mussel, in particular.<\/p><p> I am sorry that Mr. Liam Gavin, the director of services, is not sitting at the table because I have a very specific question for him.  Can I take it that the council has tried to engage with the Department?  The NPWS does not exist as a separate agency.  Let us get that out of our head.  The Ministers are in charge of the NPWS; it is not an agency.  It is an integral part of the Department.  They are not separate.  Has the council tried in every way to engage with the service to overcome the difficulty in regard to the method statements.<\/p><p> I have a second point that Mr. Gavin might elucidate.  I have alluded to the part of the road from Maam Cross to Oughterard.  Can Mr. Gavin clarify whether, when there was an oral hearing before An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the road from Maam Cross to Clifden, the council went in with a development proposal?  The council is acting on behalf of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, which is acting on behalf of the Government, which included the project in Transport 21.  In other words, it was fulfilling Government policy.  There is only one Government with collective responsibility so it includes the NPWS.  Did the Government, in a moment of great schizophrenia through the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, oppose the granting of the planning permission on environmental grounds?  Did we have the farce of two Departments acting on behalf of one Government that is meant to have a coherent policy going in to an oral hearing with separate messages, with one saying \"Give it\" and the other saying \"Don't\"?  Maybe Mr. Gavin could clarify that issue.<\/p><p> Does Mr. Gavin believe it would be a helpful step if this committee were to demand that the Minister and her officials appear before it?  We are very lucky we have two western Ministers of State in the Department, including Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, who is responsible for the Gaeltacht.  This is very relevant to the latter owing to his devolved responsibility for developing the Gaeltacht.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092000002#X00300","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474377300,"counter":310,"content":"<p>Only one minute of the ten allowed is remaining.

We have many of the same issues in Kerry and are still dealing with them.  I will highlight two.  One is the Macroom bypass, which is vital to the county and to attract investment to it.  As I have already highlighted in the D&aacute;il, it has been denied to us because some environmentalists decided we would affect a snail by building the road.  To hurt us further, they called it a Kerry snail.  The same scenario was evident, to a lesser degree, in west Kerry, where they tried to prevent us from building the N86 or from providing the people of the area with a proper, safe road.  Many people are still being hurt and maimed.  Sadly, people were killed in the area in the past.  We are encountering those problems also.<\/p> <p>  The people in rural Ireland, including Kerry, the west coast and midlands, are entitled to live as well as the people of the east coast, including Dublin.  When we turn on the 8 o'clock news every morning, we hear 200, 300 or 500 jobs have been secured for Dublin but no job for Kerry.  We cannot get a job to Kerry because we cannot attract investors owing to there being no access to the county.  Kerry Group has a brand-new facility and it hurts me every time I pass it on the way up to or down from Dublin.  It is at the side of the motorway in the heartland of Kildare.  I do not begrudge the people of Kildare or Dublin.  Maybe there is a bit of \"agro\" around the third Sunday in September if we are lucky enough to meet in Dublin for the all-Ireland final.

That is what is happening here.  The seeds of doubt are being sown in the minds of those in the environmental sector and the National Parks and Wildlife Service that this project might be too risky in terms of the pearl mussel.

First, on the question of tourism, I live in the midlands and I am frustrated with regard to the interaction with the major tourism agencies.  Our region has huge potential in terms of the Shannon blueway, the lakelands and various important heritage sites.

The diversity of problems that affect rural Ireland is demonstrated here.  There are six people sitting at this table representing three local municipal areas.  An issue that exists within one of them has almost the exact mirror image in the Kells municipal district.  For example, there is large scale development involving wind turbines and pylons.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service, as well as environmental elements and the impact on tourism are being used as a mechanism to deflect such developments.  The perception, however, is that the roadblocks to development are exactly the same agencies.  Therefore the diversity at this table reflects the diversity across rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Ireland's Ancient East is a fantastic tourism initiative which is driven in a broad sense.

Oldcastle came in as the eleventh poorest town in Ireland, while Athboy was 20th and Kells 74th.  This survey was based on infrastructure, jobs, emigration, education and health facilities.  People living in cul-de-sacs in the north Meath area will not see roads improved for years, given the amount of funding we currently have.

In the south of the county, Shire and Facebook set up operations in the past year or so.  That is great, but companies such as those to which I refer are never going to establish facilities in the north of the county.  This gives rise to conflict as regards funding in areas like Kells and the rest of the county north of Navan because while that part of the county is 100% rural, it is deemed to be part of the greater Dublin area because it is in Meath.  The north is the poor part of the county and Kells, for example, will never be an Ashbourne, a Ratoath or a Navan.  That is a major issue that must be addressed going forward.  The north will never have a Shire or a Facebook but it needs to look to its strengths, which are heritage and tourism.  That is what it should be focusing on and pushing.<\/p> <p>  I have been working on a greenway project for the past six years.  The greenway in Mayo was mentioned but I have been working on the 36 km Boyne Valley to Lakelands County Greenway, which will actually come into Kingscourt.  A feasibility report has been done, full planning permission has been granted, the detailed design statement is done and the tender documents for the first phase have been prepared.  The business case shows that the greenway will cost &euro;2.4 million but will generate &euro;5.9 million in the local economy per annum.  That business case was not pulled out of the blue but is the same as that used for the Great Western Greenway, based on a 20 km radius of the greenway and 245,000 people.  The business case did not take into consideration Meath's close proximity to Dublin because the aim was to compare like with like.  In terms of the strengths of the north of the county, tourism is the main one.  This greenway could be a game changer for north Meath as well as Cavan.<\/p><p>I will let Mr. Barry Lynch respond to the question on spatial planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092000002#EE00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Cassidy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474377300,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Our experience in terms of engagement on the spatial strategy would be similar to that in Cavan.

At a top level, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport appears not to have enough money to maintain the road network to the required standard, and with the current financial constraints, it will be 2020 before adequate funding will be available.  Kells has a particular difficulty because it has one third of the roads in the county, that is, 1,100 km of road which has to be maintained.

We have developed it as far as the preliminary design stage but it has been halted at that stage, primarily due to funding.  This is a major issue for us, particularly in east County Cavan because it is highly dependent on the regional road network and is not served by any national roads.  The local road network is in a very poor state of repair and the area is neglected, as is the adjacent area in County Meath.  Funding seems to be the critical element.

The prevailing view of planning is highly urban centred and is based on the spillover theory that if one keeps developing towns, rural areas will eventually benefit by some great process.  Oldcastle in County Meath and the Cooley Peninsula on the east coast were CL&Aacute;R areas, in other words, areas that experienced a substantial decline in population from the 1920s onwards.  Given their proximity to Dublin, the spillover theory is clearly not working.<\/p> <p>  The simple explanation is that most people do not travel for more than 40 or 45 minutes in a car from their place of work to their place of residence.  This is to be seen in Galway where one comes off the cliff, so to speak, beyond Loughrea.  I take serious issue with planners who believe the entire west will be developed as a result of development in Galway city.  The process does not work that way.  On the contrary, what we saw in the most recent census was a complete reverse of the previous trend of rural population growth.  We are now seeing a collapse in population in areas located more than a certain travel time from the city.  In this regard, distance is crucial but it must be measured in terms of time rather than physical distance.  Road infrastructure is very important in this regard and if we fail to address it, areas such as east Galway and west Connemara will be in a very bad way.<\/p> <p>  I take slight issue with the Chairman in that I disagree with the notion of allocating money on the basis of population.  We had a tradition whereby certain things were a fundamental right of the citizen and other things were the fundamental right of the community.  During the Second World War, a decision was made to provide every house with electricity, whether it was on top of a mountain or near a town.  It was also decided to provide a State-wide telephone service.  While the service was slow, people had access to a landline.<\/p> <p>  The committee should lay out a national typology of basic services to which every household is entitled.  This includes a roadway to one's house and access to water, electricity, fibre broadband and a mobile telephone service.  Every community also has a right to basic services, including education and health.  Obviously, one must decide what level of education and health services would be provided and how local they should be.  Sports facilities and so on also need to be provided locally and population should not be an inhibitor.<\/p> <p>  I had ministerial responsibility for the islands.  While it may be an extreme case, we found that we could provide very small islands with the basic services a community would expect to facilitate a decent community life.<\/p><p> I take issue with another point that was made.  Having been responsible for creating jobs in rural areas, I am of the view that it is as easy to create jobs in such areas as it is to create them in urban areas, provided one takes the right approach.  Some of the most successful businesses derive from rural areas.  All of the multinational, indigenous co-operative industries - the major milk companies and so forth - can be traced back more than 100 years ago to Horace Plunkett.  These are some of our most advanced indigenous industries and they are rooted to this island.  If one takes job years as a measure, they are very important companies.  Rural areas have significant potential for further job creation but this will not be possible without infrastructure.  I remember when I moved to Connemara to become a manager of a co-operative that it took me a year and a half to obtain a telephone.  We struggled against the odds and succeeded.  I realised then that a lack of simple infrastructure was a serious inhibitor to job creation.  Basic things that people take for granted were the problem, rather than anything in the local area.<\/p><p> I am proud that a high volume of timber lorries forced the county council to replace virtually every bridge in the area because they collapsed under the weight of those vehicles.  This occurred long before Mr. Gavin's time and I have no compunction in stating it was one of my greatest achievements because it resulted in all the roads being straightened and all the bridges being replaced.  Basic infrastructure is needed.  I started at a small level.  Other people took over to much greater effect and there is now an industry that directly and indirectly employs 300 people in the middle of what people would describe as the back of beyond.<\/p><p> It would not be in the interests of my native city, Dublin, to concentrate all development in cities because we have serious social problems in our cities.  People are being sucked out of rural areas and when they arrive in the capital they cannot secure housing or move around the city because of the traffic. The quality of life in Dublin is suffering because of excessive congestion.  In other parts of the country, the problem is that there are not enough children for the local schools and not enough people to use health centres and so on.  These areas need more people.<\/p><p> It is vital that the committee has a conversation, as the President would describe it, about this major national policy area.  We should discuss what direction we should take, whether every area, irrespective of population numbers, has a right to a certain level of service and if every area also has significant potential for development.  I believe that is the case and that, if one had a mind to it, there is not a part of the country where it would not be possible to generate considerable development with support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RGJ2016092000002#GG00400","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474377300,"counter":365,"content":"<p>The Deputy may have misunderstood my point, which was that funding should reflect population but also have a disruptive effect.
