This type of increase is typically observed at the start of all downturns and is evidence that some employers put workers on part-time employment as part of an adjustment strategy to cope with the reality of recession.  The most recent data indicate that almost one third of all part-time workers are underemployed.<\/p><p>  Some people classified by CSO as underemployed receive income support from my Department to supplement their earnings in employment.  The number of such casual and part-time workers included in the Live Register, for example, rose from about 20,000 in early 2008 to almost 90,000 at the end of last month.  In addition, other persons classified as underemployed may be receiving payments from my Department under the Systematic Short-time Working Scheme, under schemes such as Community Employment and T&uacute;s that provide part-time temporary employment, and under other working-age schemes such as the One Parent Family Payment scheme.<\/p><p>  A key factor driving this rise in underemployment is the weak labour demand in the domestic economy.  The approach to reducing underemployment is the same as that for reducing unemployment.  The Government's primary strategy to tackle both unemployment and underemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity through the Action Plan for Jobs.  Through the Pathways to Work strategy, we are trying to ensure that persons on the Live Register are in a position to take up full-time job opportunities as they arise.  This is being done through a range of activation measures to provide support and assistance to jobseekers combined with  a renewed focus on building relations with employers in order to encourage recruitment of people from the Live Register.<\/p><p>  Measures of particular relevance to counteracting underemployment are those that incentivise employers to give full-time jobs to persons who are currently on the Live Register (including the underemployed), most notably the Employers PRSI Incentive and the Revenue Job Assist Scheme.  These will be replaced in July of this year by JobsPlus, a single simplified programme.<\/p><p>  The Part-Time Job Incentive (PTJI) Scheme is intended as a stepping stone to full-time work partly in recognition of the reality of underemployment.  It allows certain long-term unemployed people to take up part-time work and get a special weekly allowance instead of their jobseeker's payment.  The Department also supports jobseekers to transition to full-time employment through the Family Income Support Scheme.<\/p><p>  Finally, as I mentioned earlier, the Department provides income support to the underemployed to supplement their earned income, via Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit\/Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, provided a person is working no more than 3 days a week.  Jobseekers payments paid in conjunction with such periods of casual employment may now count towards satisfying the qualifying period for access to the JobBridge Internship programme. Underemployed casual workers are also entitled to access a range of part-time training and education opportunities for unemployed people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400062#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Money Advice and Budgeting Service Remit","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400062#WRB00600"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[18939\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400062#WRB00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the role of the Money Advisory Bureau under the new personal insolvency regime; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>MABS, which comes within the remit of the Citizens Information Board, provides a high quality service which assists people who are over-indebted or in danger of over-indebtedness, in particular those on low incomes.

As part of this structure there are 13 dedicated officers at senior management level leading the engagement process with employers at a regional level.<\/p><p>  Turning to the issue of contracting, as part of its employment service provision, the Department already contracts with other providers for the delivery of both the Local Employment Service (LES) and Job Clubs.  Employment services, including career planning, engagement with employers and job search assistance, are provided under contract by these organisations to clients who are activated by the Department.  The Department funds this contracted provision to the value of approximately &euro;25m per annum and these organisations employ approximately 390 staff, who are engaged in the provision of these services.<\/p><p>  The Department is at present considering how it might supplement its existing delivery capacity through the further expansion of contracting.  The Department has engaged external services in a variety of areas such as Local Employment Services and Job Clubs.  The Department retained the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion (CESI) in November 2012 to provide expert advice with regard to the potential for, and the design of, a contracting model based on a risk sharing payment structure.  The Department is currently considering the CESI report and will in due course finalise its own position.  It is important to note that, although the term &lsquo;private contracting&rsquo; is used in some quarters to indicate service provision by organisations outside of the direct state sector, experience in other countries indicates that the voluntary and not-for-profit sectors feature strongly in the supply-chain.<\/p><p>  As set out in Pathways to Work, the introduction of the new Intreo service is a multi-annual project.

The independence of the office is evidenced by the high level of appeals which were allowed in favour of the appellant (50.4%) in 2012.  This issue a searchable, anonymised database was the subject of a recent High Court case, Ikraam Jama v Minister for Social Protection, 11 October 2011. The Judge in that case found that there was no duty on the SWAO to maintain a database for public access. In the course of that challenge, comparisons were drawn with the Social Security Commissioners in Northern Ireland, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the Equality Tribunal who do publish their decisions. In 2010, the Social Security Commissioners in Northern Ireland finalised 141 decisions, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal finalised 2,783 and the Equality Tribunal finalised 322 whereas the Social Welfare Appeals Office finalised 28,166 decisions in the same period.<\/p><p><br \/>  Given the volume of social welfare appeals which are decided annually (32,558 appeals were decided in 2012), the provision of such a database would be a vast and resource-intensive undertaking. For example, in creating and maintaining such a database, it would not be enough to remove names and addresses, all personal information would have to be removed so that not even a family member could recognise the case.  Equally, examining anonymised cases could also be misleading given the wide range of variables between the circumstances of different individuals and where the slightest variation between circumstances might mean a different conclusion would be arrived at.<\/p><p><br \/>  However, it is recognised that there is a clear need to strike a balance between achieving effectiveness and efficiency in administering the appeals system and the need to ensure fair and equitable access to customers.

Up to 500 childcare places will be available to people who have been long term unemployed or were former recipients of the One Parent Family Payment and who have got a job offer or have significantly increased their part time work.<\/p><p>  The rate of subsidy for the scheme is &euro;35 per week rate of subvention and a parental contribution of &euro;20 per week per child. During school holidays the subvention rate will increase to &euro;100 per week but the parental contribution will remain at &euro;20 per week.  Customers who meet the criteria will get a letter of eligibility so that they can apply to the local childcare committee for a place. The new scheme will incentivise and support people who are long term unemployed to avail of an employment opportunity by providing them with increased access to subsidised after-school child care.  The scheme will build on the existing supports provided for, and implemented by, the D\/CYA in the child care sector, including the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) schemes, through which child care is provided to some 40,000 children of low-income parents at reduced rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400063#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Rates","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400063#WRC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[18932\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400063#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which she expects to be in a position to meet the budgetary requirements of her Department without the imposition of extra curtailments in respect of payments to social welfare recipients such as job seekers, old age pensioners and those in receipt of child or adult dependent allowances and\/or disability related payments; if she has identified the extent to which she can comply with the Troika requirements entered into by her predecessor in the coming year and thereafter; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":43,"content":"<p>Thee Estimates for the Department of Social Protection as published in the 2013 Revised Estimates (REV) provides for expenditure of &euro;20.243 billion on schemes, services and administration in 2013.

Currently there are c 6,000 people on internships with c 2,500 internships opportunities available to be filled.  In order to assess the impact of the scheme the Department commissioned Indecon economic consultants to complete an independent evaluation based on an analysis of Departmental data and surveys and interviews with host organisations and interns.  I expect to publish the final report from Indecon in May.  <\/p><p>  Indecon&rsquo;s interim report, published last year, found that 61% of interns secured employment either with their host organisation or another employer within 5 months of finishing an internship.  These progression rates compare very favourably with similar schemes across Europe.  The evaluation study also found that 67% of internships were with private sector host organizations.  The participation of large numbers of private sector host organisations is making a significant contribution to the quality of experience for interns and in improving their chances in entering the workforce.  <\/p><p>  Of those individuals who undertook their internships in private sector host organisations, 54.1% were in employment at the time of the research (this includes interns who had just completed their internship) of whom 30.2% were in employment with their host organization.  This indicates that c one third of interns progress from an internship into direct employment with the host organisation.  The issue of host organisations making a financial contribution to the weekly top-up payment to interns is under review in my Department.  However any change to existing arrangements will need careful consideration as one of the advantages of the existing scheme is that it is simple to understand and administer for interns, host organisations and the Department. <\/p><p>  With regard to the issue of displacement the Department has taken all reasonable steps to minimise displacement of existing paid employment by internships.  The terms of the scheme prohibit the use of internships to displace existing employees, there are limits on the number of internships a host organisation can offer (no more than 10% of the workforce at a particular location), host organisations are not permitted to &lsquo;roll-over&rsquo; internships by replacing one intern with another at the end of the internship, and all applications from host organisations are screened to minimise the possibility of displacement.  Nevertheless displacement may be subtle and it is impossible to eliminate it completely.  <\/p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s own control measures are based on a combination of randomised monitoring visits\/inspections with host organisations and on investigation of complaints received from interns.  As of 18th April, 2013, 15 host organisations have been excluded from further participation in JobBridge as a consequence of these control activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400063#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Benefit Rates","counter":53,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400063#WRC01350"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[18958\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400063#WRC01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans for the future of child benefit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":55,"content":"<p>Child benefit is a universal payment that assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. The estimated expenditure on child benefit in 2013 is around &euro;1.9 billion and it is currently paid to around 611,000 families in respect of some 1.16 million children.  The social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment. Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation.

Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation.<\/p><p>  Achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness and the efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes can be achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and its report on this issue was published in February.<\/p><p>  This report makes important recommendations on how child benefit could be maintained as a universal payment while reforming the current system of child and family income supports so as to better target those who need these supports most. The Group concluded that there is no one perfect method of targeting child and family income supports. While some members of the Advisory Group found that taxation of child benefit is an attractive reform option, it was recognised that this approach, being  limited to only one child and family income support payment, does not contribute to a better overall design of the child and family income support system. For this and other reasons, there was a strong preference in the Group for another approach based on a two-tier child and family income support payment.  The Group considered that this approach would allow for a rationalisation of the overall child income support system while minimising work disincentives and allow for better flexibility in the targeting of support for different household types.<\/p><p>  Given the range of complex issues involved, including fiscal, operational and legal considerations, as well as the implications for reforms in terms of child poverty and employment incentive outcomes, the Government has made no decision at this time on the core recommendations of the report.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the report will now contribute to the policy debate on the matter. In considering the proposals to reform the structure of child and family income support payments, including the balance between income supports and services, such as childcare, I expect that Government will also take into account further work by the Advisory Group on the issue of social protection and taxation supports for working age persons and more general developments in the budgetary and fiscal situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400063#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":56,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400063#WRC01550"},{"type":"question","counter":57,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[18840\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400063#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 92 of 5 March 2013, the date on which the social impact assessment of the taxation and welfare changes announced in Budget 2013 was completed; the date on which it will be published; the number of persons within her Department who were tasked to complete this work and their positions within her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1080","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":58,"content":"<p>My department published the Social Impact Assessment of Budget 2013 on 28 March 2013.

It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.

The Table below provides details of processing times for each of the Department&rsquo;s schemes in March 2013.  A further breakdown of the time taken for the individual steps in the processing of claims is not available.  All claims are registered promptly, in some schemes this is done through the scanning of claim documents onto the system while in other schemes this involves an officer inputting data.  The time taken to perform means tests and\/or medical examinations where these are required is not measured separately, while a determination on habitual residence where required is an integral part of the decision making process.<\/p><p>As can be seen from the data in the table below, schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.  Delays can also arise if information is required from social security organisations in other jurisdictions and where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.  Work on clearing backlogs in some scheme areas, such as carers allowance and invalidity pension has temporarily distorted the time taken to clear claims due to the high level of reviews and appeals following backlog clearances, but the progress made will be reflected in processing times in the coming months.  Both schemes are up to date with the processing of new applications, as is family income supplement for both new and renewal applications.<\/p><p>As part of the Department&rsquo;s programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.  In addition, the staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.<\/p><p>The new Intreo service is currently being rolled-out and implemented on a phased basis.  This new service integrates employment and income supports and provides for a streamlined and personalized service to clients in accessing job opportunities and availing of supports to enable them to get back to work at the earliest possible opportunity.  The Intreo Centres also include a single integrated decision-making team that integrate and streamline the processes formerly undertaken by the different agencies now amalgamated into the Department.  The benefits of the integrated decisions process are already visible in terms of shorter decision times and in the reduced recourse to supplementary payments in offices where integrated decisions are in operation.<\/p><p>I wish to assure the Deputies that prompt processing of claims remains a priority for me.

Any host organisation which is found to be displacing paid staff in contravention of the scheme rules will be disbarred from further access to the scheme.  In addition, all existing internships with that host organisation will cease with immediate effect.   I understand that the facility referred to in the question is operated by a private firm operating under contract with the local authority.  The complaint made is currently being investigated by the Department and I am advised that an investigating officer has been in contact with both the individual who raised the complaint and with the host organisation.  I expect a report on the matter to be finalised shortly.<\/p><p>  The whole purpose of Jobbridge  is to encourage job creation and to incentivise employers to offer opportunities to unemployed people. It runs counter to the logic of the scheme that it  should be used to displace existing employees onto the live register and I will not tolerate such behaviour.   In fact the scheme has been designed and is operated with a number of controls designed to minimise the risk of such behaviour. Specifically:<\/p><p>-  The host organisation may not provide an internship opportunity under the Scheme to an individual with whom they have an existing employment relationship <\/p><p>-  The host organisation cannot advertise internships if they have paid employment vacancies in the area of activity in which the internship is offered.<\/p><p>-  The total number of internships which may be availed of by a host organisation is limited to 1 in 10 of their workforce or, in the case of very large employers, an absolute limit of 200 staff.<\/p><p>-  Organisations must abide by a six-month cooling-off period between internships; in other words an organisation cannot &lsquo;roll-over&rsquo; internships on a continuous basis. This limits the ability of an internship to substitute for a permanent role.<\/p><p>-  The host organisation must commit to provide coaching and mentoring to the interns and to complete monthly compliance returns to the Department of Social Protection<\/p><p>-  All applications from host organisations to advertise internships are reviewed and assessed against these criteria by the Department&rsquo;s National Contact Centre in Edenderry. <\/p><p>-  The Department of Social Protection proactively monitors  internships on an ongoing basis.  This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and the conduct of random monitoring site inspections.  Since Jobbridge was launched 1,712 monitoring visits have been conducted. <\/p><p>-  All complaints received from interns or members of the public are investigated.

The revised target is to reduce consistent poverty to 4 per cent by 2016 (interim target) and to 2 per cent or less by 2020, from the 2010 baseline rate of 6.2 per cent. Ireland&rsquo;s revised contribution to the EU poverty target is to lift a minimum of 200,000 people out of the population in &lsquo;combined poverty&rsquo; between 2012 and 2020.  In addition, the Government has agreed to set new sub-targets for children and jobless households and to strengthen the implementation of the target through annual monitoring and social impact assessment. <\/p><p>  The Department recently published, for the first time, a &ldquo;Social Inclusion Monitor&rdquo; using the latest data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) to report on progress towards the national social target for poverty reduction.  In 2011, the consistent poverty rate was 6.9 per cent, which according to the CSO &lsquo;is not a statistically significant change on the 2010 figure of 6.3 per cent&rsquo;.  The consistent poverty trend in the first year of monitoring the new target reflects the severity of the economic crisis but also demonstrates the effectiveness of policy given the strong performance of social transfers in protecting those on the lowest incomes.  In 2011, social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of poverty rate from 40 per cent to 16 per cent, representing a poverty reduction effect of 60 per cent (rising to 68 per cent if pensions are included).<\/p><p>  The Deputies will appreciate that it is too early to draw firm conclusions on the extent to which poverty can be reduced over the coming years.  However, the Government expects that effective and targeted policies across all Government programmes and Department - coupled with improvement in the underlying economy and labour and boosted by the commitment of the social partners and civil society - will yield future dividends on reaching the national social target for poverty reduction in the years up to 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400065#WRE00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Redundancy Payments","counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400065#WRE00850"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[18832\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400065#WRE00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the date on which her Department&rsquo;s website will reinstate the practice of showing a statistical breakdown of redundancy figures based on industry, county and gender.","asker":"981","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":103,"content":"<p>At present, the Department is not in a position to provide a breakdown of the redundancy statistics by county, sector or gender.

Details of all grant recipients since 2006 can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at http:\/\/www.dfa.ie\/home\/index.aspx?id=298.    The emphasis of the Emigrant Support Programme is on supporting culturally sensitive, front-line welfare services, targeted at the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities, particularly in Britain and the United States.  These services have made a substantive difference to the lives of these communities overseas through reducing homelessness, tackling social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access their local statutory entitlements.<\/p><p>In addition, the ESP has facilitated Government support for a range of community and heritage projects, strategic capital projects and other initiatives aimed at creating practical results-orientated links between Ireland and the global Irish, including those that emerged from the Global Irish Economic Forums.<\/p><p>I am pleased that, despite the difficult financial situation we face, the Government has maintained the 2013 funding for the ESP at &euro;11.59 million, the same level as 2012.

As a new service that will have exceptional temporary pressures at particular stages of its initial implementation it is difficult to predict the level of contact that will arise during its introduction and, consequently, the resource required to handle queries from members of the public.  The Expenditure Report for 2013, which was published in December last, makes a provision of &euro;25.9m in 2013 for the implementation of LPT.  The total cost of LPT to the end of March 2013 is approximately &euro;6.6m.<\/p><p>  Revenue considered a number of options for the provision of a phone call service to handle queries from members of the public. Revenue decided to use a mix of existing staff, staff from the redeployment resource panel, temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) and external resources to deal with Local Property Tax.  At the end of March 2013, Revenue had a total of 155 full-time equivalent staff assigned to LPT, comprising 125 permanent and 30 TCOs.  The permanent staff resource was filled through the internal redeployment of existing staff and the recruitment of a total of 29 staff from the Public Service Resource panel.  Revenue is currently in the process of recruiting an additional 25 TCOs to support the introduction of LPT.<\/p><p>  Following an open competitive tendering process, the contract for call services was awarded on the basis that the service provider would <\/p><p>  1. Deliver information and assistance to taxpayers having difficulty understanding LPT and completing their returns and making payments.<\/p><p>  2. Assist taxpayers to navigate a new online system for filing returns and payments for LPT. <\/p><p>  3. Escalate calls to a Revenue call service where taxpayer specific information is required to resolve the call.<\/p><p>  4. Make outbound calls to taxpayers with information on their LPT queries where requested by Revenue to do so.<\/p><p>  5. Provide telephony infrastructure and supports to allow direct transfer to Revenue.<\/p><p>  6. Support services and resources including account management and quality control.<\/p><p>  The service is provided on a 9 am to 5 pm, Monday to Friday basis. The service provider has the ability to scale operations up or down in response to call volumes.  The service must meet Revenue customer service standards and the industry ISO standards and Revenue has provided training and training material to ensure that the standards are achieved.  An Irish language service is provided.  The necessary confidentiality and security procedures have been implemented as agreed.<\/p><p>  The service commenced on 7 March 2013 and call volumes of 108,100 were handled up to 16 April 2013.  Regular operational management, reporting and review meetings were provided for in the contract.  Reporting arrangements and quality monitoring arrangements were agreed and are being delivered.  The nature of the contract is that the cost will depend on the volume of calls handled.  In accordance with the relevant Government decision, the Revenue Commissioners publishes quarterly lists of payments over &euro;20,000 and payments made under this contract will be included in future lists.  Revenue has advised that a total &euro;67,000 was spent on external service delivery of call centre services in Q1 2013.<\/p><p>  The external service delivery of peak call handling in respect of the LPT provides a flexible, scalable response to an unpredictable demand.

These include long-term payments such as Disablement Benefit, the State Pension, Widows, Invalidity and Blind Pensions, Carers Allowance and the One Parent Family Payment, as well as short term benefits such as Job Seekers Benefit. Treating these payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  <\/p><p>  As a result of maternity benefit payments becoming liable to income tax for all claimants, from 1 July 2013, a number of possible tax outcomes could arise:<\/p><p> 1. An individual may pay no income tax on their maternity benefit payment as their tax credits will be sufficient to reduce their tax liability to zero.<\/p><p> 2. An individual may pay income tax on some or all of their maternity benefit payment solely at the standard rate.<\/p><p> 3. An individual may pay income tax at the standard rate on a portion of the maternity benefit and the higher rate on the balance of the maternity benefit payment.<\/p><p> 4. An individual may pay income tax on all of their maternity benefit payment at the higher rate.<\/p><p>  I am fully aware that some employers do not pay a top up payment to their employees whilst on maternity leave.  However, in such circumstances many mothers will not be subject to income tax on their maternity benefit payments as their personal credits will ensure that no tax arises on the social welfare income itself. Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends on the level of income that a recipient has in a tax year.  Accordingly, the tax liability on maternity benefit payments will ultimately depend on the total income of the individual or couple concerned in the tax year or years concerned.<\/p><p>  There are situations currently where an employee continues to be paid by her employer, while on maternity leave and, based on her PRSI contributions, is entitled to Maternity Benefit from the Department of Social Protection. The non-taxation of such benefit currently results in an employee having a greater net take-home pay for the period of maternity benefit, than if she was at work.  The rates of Maternity Benefit are earnings-related and are set to reflect post-tax income. It was never intended that individuals would gain financially by being on maternity leave.  The introduction of the charge to income tax on maternity benefit payments will ensure that those with identical incomes will be treated the same for income tax purposes.    <\/p><p>  I would point out though, that maternity benefit payments will remain exempt from Universal Social Charge and PRSI.  Given the current budgetary constraints I have no plans to introduce a tax exemption along the lines proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400068#WRH02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":189,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400069#WRJ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":190,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[19421\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400069#WRJ00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to bring the State contributory pension within the standard PAYE taxing procedures (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":191,"content":"<p>The proposal put forward is that the contributory State pension should be taxed at source by the Department of Social Protection (DSP), and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they agree with the proposal.

It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return (Form 12) is not captured in the Revenue computer system.  However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than &euro;3,174 is required to complete an income tax return (Form 11).  The estimated relief claimed has assumed tax forgone at the 41% rate for 2010 in the case of individuals and 12.5% in the case of companies. The figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax.  Corresponding data cannot yet be provided for 2011 and 2012, as the tax returns for these years are either in the early stages of being filed or are not yet due.<\/p><p><br \/>  I would like to remind the Deputy that Finance Act 2012 contained two measures related to property reliefs designed to reduce the ongoing cost of these schemes to the Exchequer and to eliminate it in as short a time as possible.  With effect from 1 January 2012, a USC surcharge was introduced on all investors with annual gross incomes over &euro;100,000. The surcharge applies at a rate of 5% on the amount of income sheltered by property reliefs in a given year and will be in addition to any normal USC payable on this income. This USC surcharge applies to all investors with this level of gross income regardless of whether they invested in Section 23 type investments or accelerated capital allowance schemes.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, investors in accelerated capital allowance schemes will no longer be able to use any capital allowances beyond the tax life of the particular scheme where that tax life ends after 1 January 2015. Where the tax life of a scheme has ended before 1 January 2015 no carry forward of allowances into 2015 will be allowed. The delayed implementation of this measure is designed to give individuals time to adjust to the absence of the carry forward provision. <\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to capital allowances in respect of capital expenditure on certain qualifying hospitals, the termination date for incurring qualifying expenditure was 31 December 2009.  However, where certain conditions were met a later termination date of the 31st December 2013 may apply.  There are now only two property based tax incentive schemes remaining in the tax code: the Mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Investment scheme (only 80% of expenditure can qualify in certain areas) and the Qualifying Specialist Palliative Care Units scheme, which was not commenced.<\/p><p><br \/>  All other such schemes have been terminated, subject to transitional arrangements for certain schemes where projects were already in the pipeline.  However, due to their nature these reliefs continue to entail ongoing costs on the Exchequer in terms of tax foregone.  Because of the nature of some of those reliefs, individuals have a right to claim them for a seven-year period. There are a number of legal considerations that would hinder the abolition of the reliefs during such run down periods.<\/p><p><br \/>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the high earners' restriction continues to apply to these legacy reliefs, and ensures that those subject to the full restriction pay a minimum effective rate of income tax of 30% in addition to USC, PRSI and the surcharges mentioned above, where applicable.

Under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, schools are resourced to cater for pupils whose educational psychological assessment places them in the high incidence, or less complex, disability category, including children with mild general learning difficulties. In this context, children with a mild intellectual disability qualify for resources under GAM. Separately, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02\/05. <\/p><p><br \/>  Once allocations have been made, it is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of resource teaching support, including supports allocated under the GAM, to best support the needs of qualifying pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance.

This advice will be included in the NCSE's comprehensive policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs which is currently in preparation and which is expected in the coming months.

Following the Government's decision of 21 February 2012, the school to which the Deputy refers was among the schools which retained disadvantaged legacy posts from previous disadvantage schemes.  <\/p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a range of factors contribute to determining the staffing requirement for individual schools including changes to enrolment and the reforms to the teacher allocation process in 2012. As the teaching allocation to schools, including disadvantage legacy posts, are enrolment based, this determines whether schools gain or lose teaching posts from year to year.  Some schools seemed to be under the impression that the Government decision of February 2012 in relation to legacy posts, implied that they would retain the number of legacy posts which they had in the 2011\/12 school year. I wish to clarify that legacy posts are retained in schools from year to year, only where warranted, based on the enrolment of the previous 30th September.  The individual schemes such as Breaking the cycle, Giving children an Even Break and the Disadvantage Areas Scheme no longer operate.<\/p><p>  The enrolment at the school in question, which is a DEIS Band 2 school currently has two legacy posts. The school's enrolment  increased slightly on 30 September 2012 over its previous year's enrolment.  As a result of this increase, one of the legacy teaching posts, which is part of the current staffing (2012\/13 school year), will be subsumed as part of the mainstream staffing for the 2013\/14 school year.  The school will retain one  legacy teaching post for the 2013\/14 school year.  In summary, the school in question will retain the same number of classroom teaching posts for the 2013\/14 school year as it has for the current school year, operating  a more favourable pupil teacher ratio than other comparable DEIS schools while not exceeding this entitlement for the 2013\/14 school year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400072#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"In-service Training","counter":282,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400072#WRM02300"},{"type":"question","counter":283,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[19468\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400072#WRM02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if retired principals are being employed by his Department, the vocational education committees or directly by schools or colleges to provide continual personal development in-service training for teachers; and if he will provide in tabular form the money paid to retired teachers providing this service on an individual basis for the past two years.","asker":"984","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":284,"content":"<p>My Department does not employ retired principals or deputy principals for the purposes of the provision of in service training for teachers.

The position is that the Valuation Act, 2001 provides for the exemption from rates of land that is developed for sport such as playing pitches. There is also provision for the exemption of community halls which are not licensed to sell alcohol and where the facilities are not used for profit and involve participation by inhabitants of the locality generally and are recreational or otherwise of a social nature.<\/p><p>  However, the Act provides that where an organisation or club is registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904 and is licensed to sell alcohol, all the club buildings, wherever located, are rateable in their entirety. The legislation is unambiguous in this regard and the Valuation Office has no option but to consider all such premises to be rateable. However, in all such cases exemption from rates can be achieved by the cessation of the liquor licence. <\/p><p>  The sale of alcohol is a commercial activity and the club is competing with other commercial licensed premises in their locality, all of which are rateable. The apportionment of club premises between areas used for the sale of alcohol and those areas used for other activities could be operationally problematic and lead to anomalies in the rateability of premises licensed to sell alcohol. There are no plans to provide for special treatment of licensed clubs under the Valuation Act, which maintains the long-standing principle that all commercial activities are valued in a fair and equitable manner.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400073#WRN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400073#WRN01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":308,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400073#WRN01350"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[19218\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400073#WRN01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if any of his Department&rsquo;s 2012 capital expenditure allocation was used for current expenditure purposes last year, the amount used for this purpose; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":310,"content":"<p>None of my Department&rsquo;s 2012 Capital expenditure allocation was used for current expenditure purposes.

The measures encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis.

In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education, training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400074#WRO01100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages","counter":330,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400074#WRO01150"},{"type":"question","counter":331,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[19438\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400074#WRO01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of a home care package payment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":332,"content":"<p>This is a matter for my colleague in the Department of Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400074#WRO01300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Respite Care Grant","counter":333,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400074#WRO01350"},{"type":"question","counter":334,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[19487\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400074#WRO01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will reverse the 19% cut to the respite care grant and actively support the campaign by carers to give carer's a break","asker":"1017","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":335,"content":"<p>The contribution that people provide in caring for members of their own family is critical for society.  It was for that reason that the Government last year adopted the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy with a view to giving greater public recognition to carers and their work.  <\/p><p>  Carers receive significant income supports from the Department of Social Protection so that people can continue living at home as far as possible.  Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.  The expenditure on carers in 2012 included: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance; &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit; &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and; &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance.

The revised rate of &euro;1,375 will still be more than what it was in 2006 when the rate was &euro;1,200. The respite care grant is paid to more than 70,000 people each year, with some 5,000 people in receipt of more than one grant as they care for more than one person.  Almost 54,000 people are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and 27,000 in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  There are also 1,700 in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  Some 5,000 carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment also receive the grant.  <\/p><p>  The supports available to carers in Ireland are among the highest rates of income support in Europe.  A person getting certain qualifying payments and also providing full-time care and attention to another person can keep their main social welfare payment and receive a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance as well.  The half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance was protected in Budget 2013.  The respite care grant is available to all full-time carers regardless of their means while the income disregard and means test for carers allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system.  A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance while a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.

There were 68,000 young unemployed, on average, in 2012, made up of 18,500 aged 15-19 and 49,500 aged 20-24. Overall, the under-25 age group had an unemployment rate of 30% (40% for 15-19 year-olds and 28% for 20-24 year-olds). This compares to an unemployment rate of 13.5% for prime age workers (ages 25-54). Of particular concern is the continued increase in the share of youth unemployed who are out of work for more than one year. They now account for almost half of all unemployed youth (47%).<font color=\"#FF0000\">  <\/font>  In this context, it is a welcome development that the most recent official labour market figures indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, showed a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier. It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government's primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance\/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies.<\/p><p>In terms of education, the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) scheme run by my Department provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated in the BTEA in the last academic year.  MOMENTUM, a new Department of Education and Skills initiative,   launched in 2013, has a specific youth component. MOMENTUM will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 jobseekers (who are unemployed for 12 months or more) to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors. MOMENTUM consists of four themes, of which theme 4 is dedicated to under 25s. <\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of training, approximately 12,000 persons aged under 25 completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2012 (excluding apprenticeships and evening courses). Training allowances on eligible courses exceed what a young person would receive in jobseekers' payments, providing an incentive to take up training programmes. Training courses relevant to the individual job-seeker's needs are available to all young unemployed.<\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of job-search assistance, some 25,500 young people registered with Employment Services in 2012, representing 36% of all new registrants.  Registering with Employment Services gives job-seekers access to guidance interviews, job search assistance, and training courses, as well as self-service job-seeking options. <\/p><p><br \/>  Under the National Employment Action Plan (EAP) persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social Protection and referred to Employment Services for interview with the aim of assisting them to enter\/re-enter the labour market.  In 2012, there were some 33,000 referrals of under 25s to the EAP, affecting approximately 26,000 individual jobseekers (those who do not attend initially are referred again). Of those referred, 68% of clients had signed off the Live Register by the end of the year. The EAP referral process is currently being replaced, under Intreo, by referral of all unemployed persons to group engagement sessions immediately on entering the Live Register, followed by immediate one-to-one interviews for those profiled as most likely to remain unemployed for longer periods.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are a number of schemes\/programmes available that are focussed on work experience.  The most relevant for young people is JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme). Over 1,500 young people are currently participating on these schemes. The total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 was 2,700. <\/p><p><br \/>  In the December Budget, funding was secured for an additional 10,000 places this year across a range of programmes -- including JobBridge, T&Uacute;S and Community Employment. About a quarter of these places will be earmarked to be taken up by unemployed young people.<\/p><p><br \/>  Long-term unemployed youth will benefit from the JobsPlus initiative which is designed to encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. Under this scheme the State will pay circa &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the employer to recruit a person off the Live Register. Given that young people normally benefit most when employers start hiring, they are likely to be particular beneficiaries of this initiative.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally the European Commission has proposed a Council Recommendation on a European-wide approach to a &#8220;youth guarantee. The Council Recommendation -- which received political agreement from EU employment ministers in February and is expected to be formally adopted this month -- recommends that each Member State should ensure that young people receive a quality offer of employment or of continued education, an apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed. <\/p><p><br \/>  While Member States are encouraged to implement the Recommendation as soon as possible, it is recognised that implementation will need to be more gradual in countries with higher levels of youth unemployment and particularly severe budgetary problems. The government will review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400078#WRS01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Levels","counter":427,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400078#WRS01250"},{"type":"question","counter":428,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[19402\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400078#WRS01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the arrangements she has put in place to address the issue of long-term unemployment; the extent to which she expects such measures to impact on the live register in the current year; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":429,"content":"<p>The unemployment rate is currently 14.0% and while it has begun to fall after several years of increases, the rate remains unacceptably high. It is of additional concern that long-term unemployment (defined as being unemployed for a year or more) accounted for 60% (176,500) of total unemployment in Q4 2012, and for almost half of all unemployment among young people.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the first instance, the Government's primary strategy to tackle long-term unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economy recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity through the <b><i>Action Plan for Jobs<\/i><\/b>. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and thus reduce unemployment and long-term unemployment.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for measures to support the long-term unemployed and keep jobseekers close to the labour market. Past experience suggests that, without such measures, long-term unemployment may fall more slowly than overall unemployment when strong economic growth returns.<\/p><p><br \/>  Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy is to keep those on the Live Register close to the labour market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. Persons from the Live Register availing of activation measures will get an opportunity to engage in employment, training and work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves. As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.<\/p><p><br \/>  In this context, the major elements of the Government's response are set out in the <b>Pathways to Work <\/b>policy which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created are filled by people from the Live Register, with a particular focus on those who are long term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The Pathways to Work policy and the establishment of the new integrated INTREO service will transform the nature and level of engagement between our employment and income support services and the unemployed.  The policy is underpinned by five core strands which reflect the new integrated employment and income support services which are currently being established.  Each of these strands places the customer at the centre of all the service's activities, recognising their individual and specific needs.  The strands provide for:<\/p><p>- Transforming and reforming the employment and income support services institutions to deliver better services to the unemployed through an integrated approach.<\/p><p>- More regular and on-going engagement with people who are unemployed through active case management and profiling. There were almost 130,000 referrals of unemployed welfare recipients to the employment service in 2012.<\/p><p>- Greater targeting of activation places and opportunities by providing for over 85,000 places on initiatives such as Job Bridge - the National Internship Scheme, T&uacute;s, the Rural Social Scheme and the Jobs Initiative.<\/p><p>- Incentivising the take up of opportunities by the unemployed.<\/p><p>- Creating and enhancing relations with employers through incentivising the provision of opportunities for people who are unemployed.  A major initiative planned for 2013 will be JobPlus, which will streamline the existing Revenue Job Assist and Employer PRSI schemes into a single easy to administer scheme that offers an attractive incentive to employers recruiting people who are long-term unemployed.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Pathways to Work policy sets very ambitious targets for the long-term unemployed to be achieved over the next three years.<\/p><p>- To ensure that 75,000 of those long term unemployed in 2012 will move into employment by 2015.<\/p><p>- To reduce the average time spent on the live register from 21 months to less than 12 months.<\/p><p>- To ensure that employers have access to and are offered suitable candidate to fill full time vacancies and that the proportion of vacancies filled by the Department's employment services from the Live Register is at least to 40% by 2015.<\/p><p>- To ensure that each person in receipt of a jobseeker payment fulfils their personal responsibility to engage fully with the employment and training supports provided by the State as a pre-condition for recipe of their welfare payments.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to the initiatives announced under the Pathways to Work programme, the Department also manages a number of schemes providing temporary employment for the long-term unemployed on works and services of value to the community. There are currently 26,000 people participating on Community Employment and T&uacute;s. As part of Budget 2013, the Government approved 10,000 new places across CE, T&Uacute;S, JobBridge and a new social employment scheme with the Local Authorities.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Department also supports long-term unemployed people who create jobs through self-employment. Currently, about 12,000 people are being supported under the Back to Work Allowance scheme and the Short-term Enterprise Allowance scheme.<\/p><p><b>Education &amp;amp; Training<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Department of Social Protection also provides income support for long-term unemployment persons returning to education via Back to Education Allowance and the Springboard Scheme. There are almost 26,000 participants in receipt of Back to Education Allowance in the current academic year. Springboard offers a choice of free courses in higher education from certificate, to degree, to post-graduate level. All courses lead to qualifications in enterprise sectors which are growing and need skilled personnel. Participants on Springboard courses retain their social welfare payments.  Sixty-per cent of Springboard participants have been unemployed for more than twelve months and one third of those for more than 24 months. Over 3,500 people graduated from the first round of Springboard programmes, which were put in place in 2011, and an additional 6,000 places were made available for this academic year.<\/p><p><b>Policy Impact:<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The additional places being provided on a range of employment and education measures in 2013 will have a direct impact in providing opportunities for people who are currently long-term unemployed.<\/p><p><br \/>  While there should be an impact in improving people's probability of sustainable exit from the Live Register as a result of these measures, the impact is not immediately quantifiable. However, we do have some preliminary evaluation of a significant component of Pathways to Work - the JobBridge Internship Scheme. The findings of the interim evaluation of JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme by Indecon International Economic Consultants, published in October 2012, found that 61% of finishers secured employment within five months of completing their internship. These progression rates compare favourably with European averages in this area and represent very significant progress in a short period of time.  Long-term unemployed made up 38% of participants covered by the evaluation.<\/p><p><br \/>  More generally, while it is clear that long-term unemployment remains stubbornly high, there was a noticeable reduction in the inflow into long-term duration on the live register in the 2012. For example, the number of people unemployed for between one and two years fell from almost 80,000 in early 2011 to 55,000 at the end of 2012 (which is just under 13% of the total on the Live Register). This downward trend has continued in the first quarter of 2013, so that the size of this group looks set to fall below 50,000 by the end of the year.  However, many of those who became unemployed at the height of the jobs crisis in 2009 &amp;amp; 2010 have found it particularly difficult to find employment, with those on the Live Register for more than two years accounting for 32% (135,000) of all live registrants in March 2013. They are now a priority group for activation measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400078#WRS01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Unemployment Numbers","counter":430,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400078#WRS01450"},{"type":"question","counter":431,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[19403\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400078#WRS01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which youth unemployment currently reflected in the live register is likely to be affected by her proposals to address the issue of youth unemployment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":432,"content":"<p>The latest published figures show there were some 66,552 young people under 25 years of age signing on the Live Register in March 2013.

Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.

Grants are available under this scheme to carry out approved conservation works to the exterior of farm outbuildings, including roofs.

The statutory certificates of completion underpinning the procedures outlined must be signed by a registered professional i.e. a person who is included on the statutory registers of architects or building surveyors maintained in accordance with parts 3 and 5 respectively of the Building Control Act 2007 or on the register of chartered engineers established under the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland (Charter Amendment) Act 1969. <\/p><p>  Architects, Building Surveyors and Chartered Engineers are the construction professions typically involved in the design of construction works in Ireland and reference to these professions in regulation is entirely appropriate.

My Department consulted on the matter with the Law Reform Commission, which had been involved in drafting the 2009 Act, and the Commission took the view that unreasonable interference caused by high trees or hedges was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law. <\/p><p>  In England and Wales, for example, complaints about high hedges are dealt with under Part 8 of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003. This Act makes provision for local authorities to determine complaints by the owners or occupiers of domestic property who are adversely affected by evergreen hedges over 2 metres high. Broadly similar legislation, i.e. the High Hedges Act (Northern Ireland) 2011, came into operation in Northern Ireland on 31 March 2012. Helpful information notes for hedge owners, complainants and local authorities have been published on the web site of Northern Ireland's Department of the Environment. <\/p><p>  The manner in which problems associated with high hedges and trees are resolved in both England and Wales and Northern Ireland demonstrates a clear preference for the resolution of such disputes at local level, preferably by mediation, with recourse to the courts only as a last resort. This is designed to reduce the risk of prolonged and costly litigation, and the risk that court proceedings would leave a legacy of bitterness between neighbours and ill-feeling in the local community.  The introduction of such legislation in this jurisdiction would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his Department. <\/p><p>  Under our existing law, a person may be in a position to seek damages or an injunction requiring the cutting of boundary hedges or trees under the tort of nuisance. In order for the nuisance to be actionable, the person would have to show that an easement existed, i.e., whether an easement of light or otherwise, and that there had been a substantial interference with that right. <\/p><p>  It is my intention to bring forward a Mediation Bill to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings, thereby reducing legal costs and speeding up the resolution of disputes. The legislation, which is currently being drafted, will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence court proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings. It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of proceedings, on its own initiative invite parties to consider mediation and suspend the proceedings to facilitate the mediation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400083#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Applications","counter":572,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400083#WRY00750"},{"type":"question","counter":573,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[19457\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400083#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will indicate, pending decision under provision section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), if a decision will issue in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":574,"content":"<p>As explained to the Deputy previously, the person concerned is a failed asylum applicant.

Ireland's primary interaction is with the United Kingdom with whom it operates a bilateral healthcare reimbursement agreement, covering such persons as temporary visitors between the two countries, pensioners of one country and their dependants residing in the other country, and the dependant families of persons employed in the other country.  Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis.  The payment made in any one year is based on an estimate of the number of persons falling within categories eligible for reimbursement and for whom each country is liable and an estimate of the average cost of providing healthcare treatment.  Payment is made following discussions and agreement between the two administrations.  Payments are made in advance and are subject to final settlement once all necessary statistical and financial information is complete.  Total payments in any one year can relate to both final settlements in respect of previous years' liabilities and advance payments in respect of the current year.  Ireland has had waiver and bilateral agreements with many member states whereby such costs are mutually waived.  Some of these agreements have been terminated in recent years.  In view of this and of the increased numbers availing of services since the EU was expanded the HSE is putting in place measures to enable it to commence the issuing of claims for reimbursement of costs to the relevant competent states in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400083#WRDD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":708,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[19342\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400083#WRDD01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of Irish citizens over the age of 60 who have worked in other EU countries but retired to Ireland with a contributory pension from another EU country that are in receipt of non-means tested medical cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":709,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

The drugs and medicines are actually purchased by community pharmacists who are in turn recouped by the HSE.  As the drugs are purchased by individual pharmacists with no direct input by the HSE, there is no scope for the type of bulk purchasing envisaged by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  In recent years, a number of changes to the pricing and reimbursement system have been successfully introduced in Ireland. These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.  Following intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including:<\/p><p> - significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs,<\/p><p> - a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, <\/p><p> - timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and<\/p><p> - reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.<\/p><p>  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years. Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.<\/p><p>  The Department and the HSE have successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. Under this Agreement, from 1 November 2012, the HSE will only reimburse generic products which have been priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE will require a generic price to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate.<\/p><p>  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nominated EU member states in which the medicine is then available.  The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is scheduled for Report Stage today, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. The Bill provides that when the HSE is setting a reference price for, or reviewing a reference price set for, a relevant group of interchangeable medicinal products it shall take into account the following criteria:<\/p><p> - the ability of suppliers to meet patient demand for the relevant item;<\/p><p> - the value for money afforded by the relevant item;<\/p><p> - the equivalent prices of the relevant item in all other Member States where the product is marketed;<\/p><p> - the prices of therapeutically similar items; and <\/p><p> - the resources available to the HSE.<\/p><p>  It is important to balance achieving best value for money for the taxpayer with assuring continuity of supply for critical medical products, particularly in a small market like Ireland. Consequently, the Bill aims to achieve value for money while avoiding disruption in the availability of medicines on the Irish market. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400083#WREE00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cochlear Implants","counter":717,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400083#WREE00350"},{"type":"question","counter":718,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[19360\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400083#WREE00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he will make the necessary funding available in order that both ears can benefit from cochlear implants to avoid problems caused by one implant breaking; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":719,"content":"<p>Since the national cochlear implant programme commenced seventeen years ago, over 700 patients have received cochlear implants.

Two of the main recommendations in the report include the national rollout of a universal new-born hearing screening programme and the establishment of a bone anchored hearing aid programme.

This means that the idea for the research topic, whether it is for a particular disease area or linked to health services delivery, comes from the researcher. All proposals are evaluated by rigorous international peer review which focuses on the quality of the proposal, track record of the applicant, quality of the research environment, as well as potential outcomes and impacts. This process is very important for ensuring independence and maintaining high standards in the research that the HRB funds. Research proposals deemed to be excellent and in line with the HRB's strategic areas are ranked and matched against the available budget. <\/p><p>  The HRB has developed a  co-funding arrangement with the Medical Research Charities Group( MRCG) , whereby it can support research into rare diseases and disorders.

As a first step on that journey, hospitals will be aligned within groups on an administrative basis. The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive the service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients.<\/p><p>  It is well recognised that the Rotunda Hospital provides leadership in maternity services obstetrics, midwifery, neonatology and gynaecology services to all of north Dublin and the northeast.  Strong clinical links with the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, including joint consultant appointments, are a fundamental support to the work of the Rotunda, and this will continue in any configuration in which the Rotunda is required to operate. It is neither intended nor anticipated that the Rotunda will be constrained by being positioned within a particular group.  As well as its long standing links with the Mater, which can and should be retained, it would also be appropriate for the Rotunda to establish links with other hospitals to meet its future aspirations for sub-specialty development and to expand and consolidate the links which currently exist.<\/p><p>  The KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin, which was completed in 2008, noted that Dublin&rsquo;s model of stand alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be co-located with adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new national paediatric hospital. The intention has been that the National Maternity Hospital should be relocated to St Vincent's, the Coombe to Tallaght and the Rotunda to the Mater, and the maternity hospitals have been working with the relevant adult sites to progress this. There will be early discussions with the maternity hospitals regarding their maternity \/adult co-location plans in the context of the Government decision to build the new children&rsquo;s hospital on the St James&rsquo;s campus.  Notwithstanding this, I am committed to the intent of the report - that the Dublin maternity hospitals be located alongside adult acute services - while also bearing in mind the  need to plan for the provision of tri-located paediatric , adult and maternity services, as is the intention in relation to the new children's hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400083#WRFF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":740,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400083#WRFF00350"},{"type":"question","counter":741,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[19474\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400083#WRFF00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of whole time equivalent posts currently filled at Waterford Regional Hospital; the number of these whole time equivalent posts filled at Waterford Regional Hospial at the end of 2010, 2011 and 2012; the current approved employment ceiling in Waterford Regional Hospital; if it is due to be increased in the near future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1094","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":742,"content":"<p>The Government has decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet its fiscal and budgetary targets.

My Department consulted on the matter with the Law Reform Commission, which had been involved in drafting the 2009 Act, and the Commission took the view that unreasonable interference caused by high trees or hedges was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law. <\/p><p>  In England and Wales, for example, complaints about high hedges are dealt with under Part 8 of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003. This Act makes provision for local authorities to determine complaints by the owners or occupiers of domestic property who are adversely affected by evergreen hedges over 2 metres high. Broadly similar legislation, i.e. the High Hedges Act (Northern Ireland) 2011, came into operation in Northern Ireland on 31 March 2012. Helpful information notes for hedge owners, complainants and local authorities have been published on the web site of Northern Ireland's Department of the Environment. <\/p><p>  The manner in which problems associated with high hedges and trees are resolved in both England and Wales and Northern Ireland demonstrates a clear preference for the resolution of such disputes at local level, preferably by mediation, with recourse to the courts only as a last resort. This is designed to reduce the risk of prolonged and costly litigation, and the risk that court proceedings would leave a legacy of bitterness between neighbours and ill-feeling in the local community.  The introduction of such legislation in this jurisdiction would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his Department. <\/p><p>  Under our existing law, a person may be in a position to seek damages or an injunction requiring the cutting of boundary hedges or trees under the tort of nuisance. In order for the nuisance to be actionable, the person would have to show that an easement existed, i.e., whether an easement of light or otherwise, and that there had been a substantial interference with that right. <\/p><p>  It is my intention to bring forward a Mediation Bill to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings, thereby reducing legal costs and speeding up the resolution of disputes. The legislation, which is currently being drafted, will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence court proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings. It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of proceedings, on its own initiative invite parties to consider mediation and suspend the proceedings to facilitate the mediation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400084#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Applications","counter":793,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400084#WRY00750"},{"type":"question","counter":794,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[19457\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400084#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will indicate, pending decision under provision section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), if a decision will issue in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":795,"content":"<p>As explained to the Deputy previously, the person concerned is a failed asylum applicant.

Ireland's primary interaction is with the United Kingdom with whom it operates a bilateral healthcare reimbursement agreement, covering such persons as temporary visitors between the two countries, pensioners of one country and their dependants residing in the other country, and the dependant families of persons employed in the other country.  Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis.  The payment made in any one year is based on an estimate of the number of persons falling within categories eligible for reimbursement and for whom each country is liable and an estimate of the average cost of providing healthcare treatment.  Payment is made following discussions and agreement between the two administrations.  Payments are made in advance and are subject to final settlement once all necessary statistical and financial information is complete.  Total payments in any one year can relate to both final settlements in respect of previous years' liabilities and advance payments in respect of the current year.  Ireland has had waiver and bilateral agreements with many member states whereby such costs are mutually waived.  Some of these agreements have been terminated in recent years.  In view of this and of the increased numbers availing of services since the EU was expanded the HSE is putting in place measures to enable it to commence the issuing of claims for reimbursement of costs to the relevant competent states in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400089#WRDD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":929,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[19342\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400089#WRDD01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of Irish citizens over the age of 60 who have worked in other EU countries but retired to Ireland with a contributory pension from another EU country that are in receipt of non-means tested medical cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":930,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

The drugs and medicines are actually purchased by community pharmacists who are in turn recouped by the HSE.  As the drugs are purchased by individual pharmacists with no direct input by the HSE, there is no scope for the type of bulk purchasing envisaged by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  In recent years, a number of changes to the pricing and reimbursement system have been successfully introduced in Ireland. These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.  Following intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including:<\/p><p> - significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs,<\/p><p> - a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, <\/p><p> - timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and<\/p><p> - reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.<\/p><p>  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years. Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.<\/p><p>  The Department and the HSE have successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. Under this Agreement, from 1 November 2012, the HSE will only reimburse generic products which have been priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE will require a generic price to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate.<\/p><p>  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nominated EU member states in which the medicine is then available.  The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is scheduled for Report Stage today, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. The Bill provides that when the HSE is setting a reference price for, or reviewing a reference price set for, a relevant group of interchangeable medicinal products it shall take into account the following criteria:<\/p><p> - the ability of suppliers to meet patient demand for the relevant item;<\/p><p> - the value for money afforded by the relevant item;<\/p><p> - the equivalent prices of the relevant item in all other Member States where the product is marketed;<\/p><p> - the prices of therapeutically similar items; and <\/p><p> - the resources available to the HSE.<\/p><p>  It is important to balance achieving best value for money for the taxpayer with assuring continuity of supply for critical medical products, particularly in a small market like Ireland. Consequently, the Bill aims to achieve value for money while avoiding disruption in the availability of medicines on the Irish market. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400090#WREE00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cochlear Implants","counter":938,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400090#WREE00350"},{"type":"question","counter":939,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[19360\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400090#WREE00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he will make the necessary funding available in order that both ears can benefit from cochlear implants to avoid problems caused by one implant breaking; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":940,"content":"<p>Since the national cochlear implant programme commenced seventeen years ago, over 700 patients have received cochlear implants.

Two of the main recommendations in the report include the national rollout of a universal new-born hearing screening programme and the establishment of a bone anchored hearing aid programme.

The aim is to improve people's health, build health research capacity, and make a significant contribution to Ireland's knowledge economy.<\/p><p>  The Health Research Board strategy supports three broad research areas: - <\/p><p>  -\tapplied biomedical and clinical research<\/p><p>  -\tpopulation health sciences research<\/p><p>  -\thealth services research<\/p><p>  Within these areas the HRB  funds a range of scheme types from PhD scholars programmes, through post-doctoral and health professional fellowships to larger programme awards and support for infrastructure. <\/p><p>  The HRB does not ring-fence funding for any particular type of disease or disorder. It does not exclude any field of health research once it meets the HRB's criteria .<\/p><p>  Applications for HRB funding derive from bottom-up, open, competitive calls. This means that the idea for the research topic, whether it is for a particular disease area or linked to health services delivery, comes from the researcher. All proposals are evaluated by rigorous international peer review which focuses on the quality of the proposal, track record of the applicant, quality of the research environment, as well as potential outcomes and impacts. This process is very important for ensuring independence and maintaining high standards in the research that the HRB funds. Research proposals deemed to be excellent and in line with the HRB's strategic areas are ranked and matched against the available budget. <\/p><p>  The HRB has developed a  co-funding arrangement with the Medical Research Charities Group( MRCG) , whereby it can support research into rare diseases and disorders.  Each year the MRCG invites proposals for research in diseases and disorders of interest to its members and the HRB manages the rigorous evaluation of these applications through its peer review process to ensure their quality. This partnership commits over &euro;2M in funding each year to this scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400090#WREE00900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Funding","counter":947,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400090#WREE00950"},{"type":"question","counter":948,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[19441\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400090#WREE01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will rescind the decision taken by the Health Service Executive to either wholly or partly stop the issue of a research grant provided by his Department to the ISQSH via the HSE;

As a first step on that journey, hospitals will be aligned within groups on an administrative basis. The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive the service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients.<\/p><p>  It is well recognised that the Rotunda Hospital provides leadership in maternity services obstetrics, midwifery, neonatology and gynaecology services to all of north Dublin and the northeast.  Strong clinical links with the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, including joint consultant appointments, are a fundamental support to the work of the Rotunda, and this will continue in any configuration in which the Rotunda is required to operate. It is neither intended nor anticipated that the Rotunda will be constrained by being positioned within a particular group.  As well as its long standing links with the Mater, which can and should be retained, it would also be appropriate for the Rotunda to establish links with other hospitals to meet its future aspirations for sub-specialty development and to expand and consolidate the links which currently exist.<\/p><p>  The KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin, which was completed in 2008, noted that Dublin&rsquo;s model of stand alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be co-located with adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new national paediatric hospital. The intention has been that the National Maternity Hospital should be relocated to St Vincent's, the Coombe to Tallaght and the Rotunda to the Mater, and the maternity hospitals have been working with the relevant adult sites to progress this. There will be early discussions with the maternity hospitals regarding their maternity \/adult co-location plans in the context of the Government decision to build the new children&rsquo;s hospital on the St James&rsquo;s campus.  Notwithstanding this, I am committed to the intent of the report - that the Dublin maternity hospitals be located alongside adult acute services - while also bearing in mind the  need to plan for the provision of tri-located paediatric , adult and maternity services, as is the intention in relation to the new children's hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400091#WRFF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":961,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400091#WRFF00350"},{"type":"question","counter":962,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[19474\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042400091#WRFF00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of whole time equivalent posts currently filled at Waterford Regional Hospital; the number of these whole time equivalent posts filled at Waterford Regional Hospial at the end of 2010, 2011 and 2012; the current approved employment ceiling in Waterford Regional Hospital; if it is due to be increased in the near future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1094","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":963,"content":"<p>The Government has decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet its fiscal and budgetary targets.
