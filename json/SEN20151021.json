The Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne site, comprising Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth in County Meath, is a world heritage site.  Under the previous Government, work was done in 2008 to nominate other properties for submission to UNESCO, the international body that classifies places as world heritage sites.  The monastic site at Kells was included as part of a list of early medieval monastic sites in Ireland.  There are a number of such sites, including Clonmacnoise, Durrow, Glendalough, Inis Cealtra, Kells and Monasterboice.  Kells, or Ceanannas M&oacute;r, is where St. Colmcille established a religious settlement in 550 AD  It is one of the most important monastic sites in Ireland.  There are a number of buildings and places of interest in Kells, including St. Colmcille's house, the Kells monastic site, the Market Cross and the round tower.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Thomas Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2203\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->All of these symbols are synonymous with the town of Kells.

We were also told that it would take at least two years for this process.<\/p><p>I know from those who have raised questions about other sites, which have been put forward for tentative status, that it appears precious little has been done by the Minister responsible for it.

I would have thought the local authority would have been a key partner with the Department Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in ensuring the Kells monastic site receives world heritage status.<\/p><p>A significant amount of work has been done in the town of Kells over the past five years by voluntary and community groups, including the Tourism Forum, the Local Heroes programme and many others, to promote the town.

Each stage of the process has to be quality controlled and checked by experts to ensure the nomination documentation reaches the high standards laid down by UNESCO.  We are working at all times to UNESCO standards and requirements and not to any local framework.<\/p> <p>Ireland's current world heritage tentative list has come about from a comprehensive, thorough and detailed process undertaken by a panel of Irish and international heritage experts specifically appointed for that purpose.  The tentative list produced by the expert group contains a list of seven potential nominations, including early medieval monastic sites of which Kells forms part, along with Clonmacnoise, Durrow, Glendalough, Inis Cealtra and Monasterboice.  The expert group felt these six sites were exemplars of the early Irish Church's rich cultural and historical past which played a crucial role in Europe's educational and artistic development.<\/p> <p>In September 2013, my Department held a seminar to explain the next steps in the process to the local authorities and local groups from the areas with proposals which had successfully made it on to the tentative list.  The objective was to gauge the extent of the support which would be available to advance these proposals, as well as to set out the work that would be involved and the associated costs.  The seminar was followed by a series of working group meetings related to each of the sites.  My Department, together with world heritage experts, was there to facilitate discussion.<\/p> <p>My Department's view is that without strong local enthusiasm and backing there is little prospect of success for any nomination.  This bottom-up approach is also UNESCO's favoured policy.  As Kells is in a serial nomination with other sites and is part of a representative sample of Irish monuments, unless all the component parts enjoy local support, there is much less scope for a nomination to proceed any further.  The representatives who are now most actively engaged with my Department in pushing on with their proposals on that basis are those from The Burren and the Royal Sites of Ireland.<\/p> <p>Although other nominations may not be moving ahead as quickly, this does not mean that they are removed from the tentative list.  My Department would be delighted to engage again with representatives of the areas in the early medieval monastic sites nomination, if the local communities, and especially the local authorities which must generally take the lead, are interested.  However, without all involved firmly on board, the rationale for the nomination does not have the necessary standing or completeness.<\/p> <p>My Department has sought, and continues, to work with local interests to bring forward the nominations of the internationally important archaeological sites on our tentative list.  This will continue to be the approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#B00200","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>This is the most outrageous reply I have received to a question in this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#B00300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I heard the Senator say that before.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#B00400","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>For the Minister, who is legally and internationally responsible for arranging world heritage status between UNESCO and the Government, to claim there is not enough interest in these areas is outrageous.

One group met with the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, last June about protecting some of these sites but it has heard nothing back.  Perhaps the Minister could deal with that.  That was a complaint I heard two nights ago.  The town of Kells and the groups there are doing tremendous work.  The idea they are to be blamed for this not progressing is outrageous.  To blame the local authority is also outrageous because it is the Minister who takes the lead under the UNESCO proposals.<\/p> <p>The Minister is passing the buck.

I am raising this issue as a result of a family coming to me about their 52 year old daughter who has an intellectual disability.  The family is the main carer for their daughter.  Every morning, for the past 35 years, the family has been driving her to a Cope Foundation facility in Cork, and collecting her every evening.  The family applied for the disabled driver&rsquo;s tax concession grant but was turned down.  The family appealed but were advised it would take six to seven months.  I find this unhelpful and unsatisfactory, particularly when the parents, who have moved on in age themselves, have been caring for their daughter for that length of time.<\/p> <p>SI No. 353\/1994, Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994, only applies to where a person has a physical disability.  Where a person has an intellectual disability, no tax concessions are available.  I have examined the regulations and the Act.  In my view, it is only a matter of time before someone decides to call for a judicial review of this matter because there is discrimination involved.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colm Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2353\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These parents are providing and caring for their daughter and while they are doing everything possible for her, they are being denied a simple concession they have sought, whereas if the child had a physical disability, they would qualify for each of these concessions.  I acknowledge the main issue pertains to the delay I have raised this morning but the other issue, in respect of SI 353 of 1994 and the section of the Finance Act 1989 with which one is dealing and under which the regulations were introduced, also must be addressed.  However, the issue is the current delay in dealing with the appeal process.  Moreover, my understanding is the appeals must be dealt with in Dublin and even though these people are from Cork, they must travel to Dublin to deal with those appeals.  However, the delay is unsatisfactory and I raise this matter in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#B00600","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Colm Burke for raising this matter.  I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Finance who regrets he is unable to be present due to other business.  He apologises and would have preferred to have been present himself, had that been possible.<\/p> <p>The Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal is a body under the aegis of the Department of Finance and it is for that reason I am responding to the Senator on behalf of the Minister for Finance today.  The medical board of appeal acts as an appeals body for those applicants refused a primary medical certificate by a senior medical officer of the Health Service Executive.  The primary medical certificate is required to access the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme, which provides relief from VAT and vehicle registration tax, up to certain limits, on the purchase of an adapted car for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, assistance with fuel costs and an exemption from motor tax.  Accordingly, the medical board of appeal provides an important function in providing citizens with an appeals process, ensuring a greater degree of consistency and fairness in the award of primary medical certificates.<\/p> <p>Perhaps I can first outline the recent history of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal to provide some background on the function and remit of this body to the Seanad.  Prior to 1989, there was only one medical criterion for eligibility for the disabled drivers (tax concessions) scheme.  An applicant's general practitioner certified whether an individual met that criterion.  This gave rise to inconsistencies across the State and in 1989, it was decided to extend the number of medical criteria to five.  At the same time, it was decided that medical officers at an applicant's local health board should determine whether an applicant met the criteria for eligibility for the scheme.  This both extended the scheme and ensured a consistency of approach.  In that context it was necessary to establish the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal to provide an appeal process.  The board was initially composed of three part-time members, one of whom was appointed as chairperson.  Following the enactment of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994, the scheme was extended to passengers for the first time, which increased the workload of the board substantially.  As the board was essentially working on a part-time basis, prospective delays grew rapidly through to 2004 to a point where people were waiting for more than a year for an appeal.  As a first step to tackling these delays, provision was made through secondary legislation for the independence of the board, as well as an expansion of the number of members of the board to five.<\/p> <p>In June 2005, the Department of Finance reached an agreement with the National Rehabilitation Hospital to provide two permanent staff to the board, one a full-time administrator and one a medical consultant who also would act as chairperson of the board.  At that time, &euro;300,000 was provided in the Estimates to staff and resource the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal.  On 29 June 2005, officials from the Department of Finance appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service to inform the committee of the steps taken to tackle the delays on the board, including the new moneys allocated to the board.  Additional legislative action was also taken which allowed the Minister to appoint more members to the board of appeal, if required.  These actions bore fruit and the number of applicants awaiting an appeal fell from a high of 824 in May 2005 to 406 in June 2006.  At the end of last month, there were 110 applicants awaiting an appeal, which equates to a waiting period of approximately four to five months.<\/p> <p>At present, the board meets for 24 sessions per year, one of which is held at Mercy University Hospital in Cork city, and assesses on average 15 appeals per session.  The Minister for Finance does not agree there are undue delays in processing these applications.  First, one must remember the board relies on the membership of medical professionals who have full-time practices and must absent themselves from these to present at these sessions.  In light of this, the Minister believes 24 sessions per year is a reasonable number.  Second, I have stated the board averages 15 appeals per session.  Given the independence of the board in the exercise of its functions, the Minister for Finance cannot and would not wish to suggest an increase in the number of appeals per session, as this may not give the board an adequate amount of time to assess each appeal properly.  The Department of Finance keeps the operation of the board and the number of applicants awaiting appeal under constant review.<\/p> <p>The Senator also raised a second issue, which I will bring directly to the Minister for Finance on his behalf, if that is all right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#C00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Is the Senator satisfied?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#C00300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the reply.

In this case, all the parents seek is the concession in respect of car tax on the car, which they are being refused at present.  They live in a rural area without public transport and even if public transport was available, the person concerned must be accompanied by an adult at all times.

I have raised this Commencement matter on foot of a serious and urgent representation I received over the summer, which I have attempted to resolve both at local level and with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Before making this representation, I have raised repeatedly the lack of suitable disability housing for those in need in County Louth.  I am dealing with a few serious cases that I intend to highlight today as a representative sample, in which the quality of life for the individuals concerned is being impeded due to the lack of suitable housing in the area to which to transfer these individuals and their families.  In some cases, the medical issue or disability has been exacerbated due to the living situation or accidents have occurred due to stairs.  I do not raise these matters lightly or without approaching them from numerous angles with Louth County Council and various council members.  There simply is no suitable housing to be found for those with a disability on the housing list or the transfer list.<\/p> <p>I have made hundreds of calls, attended meetings and have written letters and e-mails in respect of specific cases over the past two years.  In one case, the person concerned has provided an abundance of medical evidence proving the current living situation is unsuitable for her condition but yet, she still remains in a two-storey home.  Two years later, I continue to be informed that there is no accommodation suitable for this family.  The representation I mentioned earlier which I received over the summer is also of extreme urgency.  It involves a young family with four young children that received the devastating news that due to his diagnosis of bone cancer, their four-year-old son must have his leg amputated on 4 November.  This young child's mother was also delivered of a new baby last Friday.  When this little boy comes home from hospital in a wheelchair with his family, he will be returning to a two-storey house that does not have a downstairs toilet or any facilities for wheelchairs downstairs.  I understand the child's condition is extremely painful and his parents must carry him up and down the stairs several times during the day for toileting and bedtime.  I visited the house myself and completely agree it is not suitable for a wheelchair.  I raised this issue in July in the hope that by November, something would be in place, namely, either the house would be adapted or the family would be accepted onto the transfer list to move.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Moran:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2388\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2388&amp;amp;pid=MaryMoran&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Unfortunately, nothing has happened since July.  I have been most disappointed with the response to the case.  Once the housing transfer form was submitted, it took a number of weeks, and several phone calls, for this family to be contacted.  When the family was initially contacted they were told the matter would be dealt with in due course.  That is okay if somebody is seeking assistance, as I understand there are priorities, but this case is a major priority.  At the very least, an occupational therapist should have attended the home at the earliest opportunity, as far back as last July, to get the necessary assessment out of the way so that when a house became available, those matters would already have been addressed.  What this family is going through is life changing and very stressful.  This young boy will have to use a wheelchair after his surgery and he will come home to a house that is not wheelchair accessible.  There are not enough bedrooms, and there is not sufficient space, in the house.

Social housing is a key priority for me and the Government, especially the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Paudie Coffey.  Under the Social Housing Strategy 2020, the total targeted provision of more than 110,000 social housing units will address the needs of the approximately 90,000 households on the housing waiting lists while also providing scope to address further emerging needs, as in the example Senator Moran raised today.  Social housing targets have been set for each local authority, including Louth County Council, up to 2017.  The targets set and the funding allocated are being invested by local authorities in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes designed to accommodate 25% of those currently on the housing waiting lists.  The target for Louth is 778 units, the delivery of which is supported by an allocation of &euro;57 million.<\/p> <p>In line with the targets set for social housing delivery, the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, announced a major social housing construction programmes in May and July this year, with &euro;492 million of investment covering all 31 local authorities, involving more than 2,800 housing units.  That included more than &euro;150 million in approvals under the capital assistance scheme, which supports approved housing bodies in the provision of housing for homeless persons, the elderly and people with disabilities.  The announcements included 75 new social housing units specifically for County Louth.  Further details of targets, allocations and projects are available on the Department's website.<\/p> <p>The assessment and allocation process for social housing support takes into account situations where a member of a household has a disability, such as in the case outlined by Senator Moran, and allows local authorities to prioritise the allocation of accommodation in those circumstances.  Under section 63 of the Local Government Act 1991, a local authority is, subject to law, independent in the performance of its functions.  Under section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated regulations, elected council members set down council policy in relation to the allocation of local authority housing in its allocation scheme, including determining the order of priority for the allocation of dwellings by the authority.  The chief executive of the local authority is required to make allocations, including decisions on transfers for existing local authority tenants, in accordance with this scheme.  I understand Louth County Council's scheme provides that transfer applications will be considered in situations where a transfer would relieve a serious medical condition, including physical or mental disability.<\/p> <p>Section 22 of the 2009 Act also provides that the chief executive may disregard the order of priority given to a household under an allocation scheme where the household is being provided with social housing support arising from specified exceptional circumstances, including exceptional medical or compassionate grounds.  Support is also provided to local authorities to meet the needs of tenants with a disability through funding for adaptations and extensions to social housing units.  In May, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, allocated &euro;10 million for these supports for 2015, an increase on recent years, with almost &euro;440,000 being made available to Louth County Council.  In summary, local authorities have a range of options available by means of which they can address cases of specific need, whether through use of the increased funding for adapting existing houses; or by making an alternative social house available where this is more suitable; or acquiring a property if that is considered the most appropriate option in individual circumstances.<\/p> <p>Senator Moran will appreciate that the Minister cannot directly tell the council what to do or who to give a house to but a range of options is available to address situations, such as the one outlined by Senator Moran.  One of those measures should be available and I hope the matter will be resolved shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#D00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Senator Moran should be very brief.

EAL posts are for children who need extra support for learning English.  The best thing might be for me to read an e-mail I received from the principal of the Mercy primary school in Waterford city as it spells out exactly the problem the school faces.  It will take me less than the allocated four minutes to do so:<\/p><blockquote>It was with shock and dismay yesterday that I opened an e-mail from the Department's primary allocations informing me that the temporary EAL post sanctioned on 1 September is being suppressed on 23 October.  I don't understand this as we have the children enrolled.  The number returned before 5 October was well over the 20% indicated in Circular 005\/2015, part 2, section 4.  We are a DEIS band 2 junior school catering for girls aged four to eight years.  We have always applied for and retained temporary language support staff, as we have always exceeded [the requirement] - I quote again from the circular, '20% of total enrolment of the school is made up of pupils that require EAL support'.  This year we have 30% of children requiring EAL support so I'm struggling to understand why this year is different, considering the numbers for previous years - 31% for 2014, 25% for 2013, 22.5% for 2012, 23% for 2011, 25.5% in 2010 and 29.5% in 2008.<\/blockquote> <p>Each and every year, including this year, the school has well exceeded the 20%.  The question the principal is asking is why this year is different when the school is well above the 20% threshold.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Cullinane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The principal goes on to say:<\/p><blockquote>One teacher cannot be expected to adequately cater for the needs of all 93 children who need EAL support.  I would also like to make you aware the children for whom we have concerns about and who are not reaching milestones as expected have been referred for speech and language assessment.  The constant response we receive back is that children must receive two years English language support before a complete assessment can be made.  Therefore, from now on it will be first class before we can cater or refer an EAL child who has started in junior infants and it could be second class before they are assessed.  Our most recent S&amp;amp;L report states 'it takes the average child between three and five years when exposed to full-time schooling and supports to speak a second language as well.'<\/blockquote><p>If the Minister of State has the figures, will he outline to us how many EAL temporary posts there are at the moment in this State?  There were 400 in 2008 and I believe there is now fewer than that.  There were cutbacks in a number of budgets.  Is that what this is about?  Are we moving the goalposts of the 20% figure?  Are we now simply looking at how many posts we have and dividing that by the number of schools to come up with a new percentage that schools have to reach?  This was a post for this school.  Schools and principals have these battles every year but when they are planning ahead for the year and are told in September that they have a post and it is pulled from them, it creates a challenge for the school and a worry and concern.  I do not know if the Minister of State has a positive response for me today but if he does not and if it is a response that he got from the Department, which is par for the course with these Commencement matters, I ask him to take this back to the Minister directly and alert her to this issue.  Hopefully it is an issue that can be resolved for the betterment of the children in the school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#D01500","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Cullinane for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position on the support provided to schools with a high concentration of pupils that require language support, such as the one he has raised today.  Teacher allocations are approved annually in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  Schools are very well informed about the rules.  Reforms introduced in the 2012-13 school year created a single simplified allocation process for both learning and language support.  At primary level, learning and language support hours are allocated on the basis of mainstream classroom teaching posts in the school.  Schools have autonomy to deploy this resource between learning support and language support depending on the specific needs of the school.  The new arrangements also provided for additional permanent teaching posts to be given to schools with high concentration of pupils that require language support.  Further additional temporary support is also provided, as necessary, on the basis of appeals by any of these schools to the primary staffing appeals board.<\/p> <p>The criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts for the 2015-16 school year is set out in primary Circular 0005\/2015, which the Senator quoted, and which is available on the Department's website.  In addition, the staffing appeal process at primary level includes the provision whereby schools with a high concentration of pupils requiring English as an additional language can apply for additional temporary language support posts.  These language support, EAL, allocations are made on the basis of appeals by schools to the primary staffing appeals board, using projected enrolment for the following September.<\/p> <p>The school referred to by the Senator today currently has one permanent language support post.  The school submitted an appeal under the English as an additional language criterion to the primary staffing appeals board.  The board upheld the appeal at its meeting in March 2015 and allocated one additional temporary language support post to the school, subject to the school achieving its projected enrolments on 30 September 2015.  The school was informed in March.  The Senator said September, but the school knew in March that it had this post.  The school would have been very clearly told that it was subject to enrolments on 30 September 2015.  That is usually very clear but that does not seem to be the case in the situation mentioned by the Senator.<\/p> <p>While schools must have at least 20% EAL pupils to apply for a temporary EAL post, not all schools with that percentage of EAL pupils will receive a temporary EAL post.  As stated in Circular 0005\/2015, additional post or posts may be approved, \"having considered the circumstances outlined by the school and having regard to the high number of pupils requiring EAL support\".  As the projected enrolment of pupils requiring language support was not achieved on 30 September 2015, the temporary language support post has been withdrawn.  The school will retain its permanent language support post.  The primary staffing appeals board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.  <\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue and giving me the opportunity to outline the process and to bring some clarity to it.  If the Senator has additional information that we are missing, I will bring it to the Minister's attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#E00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":42,"content":"<p>The answer does not bring clarity.

It then goes on to say that while schools must have at least 20% EAL pupils to apply for a temporary post, not all schools with the percentage of EAL pupils will receive a temporary post.

I acknowledge there was a debate in recent times but the revelations yesterday north of the Border in a number of reports and further revelations on this side of the Border are concerning.  Everybody is committed to the peace process with 98% of the people voting for it.  However, there have been allegations over the past number of years about internal police forces and procedures whereby child abusers were diverted to other locations.  This issue was raised by Ma&iacute;ria Cahill, a candidate in the forthcoming Seanad by-election, which is concerning.  When we hear a claim that an army council directs the operations of a democratic political party, without prejudice to anybody in that party, it is one that requires an explanation and a debate which I am sure, as a political party, it would welcome in its own interest.  This morning's contribution by Deputy Mac Lochlainn on Newstalk in which he described these reports as \"nonsense\" is not helpful.  A prerequisite to the talks in the North, which we all wish well, should be that Sinn F&eacute;in, the UUP and the DUP accept and welcome the report and commit to addressing issues raised in it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marc MacSharry:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2010\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2010&amp;amp;pid=MarcMacSharry&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Again without prejudice to anybody, that is the kind of positive and direct approach that needs to be seen rather than a pattern of denial which frankly, without prejudice, adds nothing but suspicion to anybody who is involved in democracy, from whatever party and no party.  <\/p><p>I would again like to raise the issue of rural crime.  I am sure that all Members at different times, certainly those based in rural and regional communities, have raised it.  I believe that one reaps what one sows.  The facts are the Government has closed 139 Garda stations and the latest recruitment drive which produced 200 garda&iacute; nationally has resulted in none of them being deployed to Sligo and Leitrim and only five to Donegal.  I refer to the north west region, which is where I live.  This morning a supermarket and pub were the subject of a robbery.  The town has no Garda station and the nearest Garda station is located 30 miles away.  In such situations it is difficult for garda&iacute; to reach a crime scene on time and that is why I say that the Government has reaped what it sowed.<\/p><p>Apart from the Government decimating rural Ireland through its closure of community services such as Garda stations, locations like Dromore West in County Sligo, which is where this latest robbery took place, have now become targets for sophisticated criminal gangs.  This morning's robbery was carried out by a gang of five people who used heavy machinery.  The robbers knew what they were doing, seamlessly carried out the crime and did not care about alarms going off.  Sadly, because of under resourced Garda stations and a lack of people on the ground these criminals have not yet been apprehended.  We hope that they will and wish the Garda well in that regard.  I would like the House to debate rural crime and work out what can tangibly be done to restore normality to rural communities throughout the country so that all of the people, including businesspeople and the elderly, can feel safe in their homes or business by having a visible presence of garda&iacute; in the shape of Garda stations and personnel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#G00300","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I welcome the passage of the Second Stage of the Marriage Bill through the Seanad last night.

I also welcome the fact that the Government has accepted two amendments that were tabled by my colleague, Senator Jillian van Turnhout, which relate to the abolition of the defence of reasonable chastisement.  This development is hugely important and is something that is long overdue.  It is great to see the Seanad as a Chamber in which the Government accepts amendments of this kind and I know that we will have a good debate.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on victims of crime.  Is there a projected date for the introduction in the House of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill?   This morning the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality dealt with the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  During the course of the debate powerful submissions were made by eight NGOs who work with victims of crime.  They included the Victims' Rights Alliance, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, and other groups.  In the course of their submissions the NGOs reminded us that this Bill is important because for the first time it provides a statutory framework for the protection of victims' rights in the criminal justice system.  It is also a Bill that will implement an EU directive that must be transposed in Ireland by 16 November.  The legislation has reached the heads of a Bill stage.  The committee is hastening through its pre-legislative scrutiny of the legislation.  I wonder can we get it into the Seanad without any undue delay.  During the submissions we also heard from Safe Ireland, which released its data on domestic violence this morning which contained some frightening figures.  As Safe Ireland pointed out to us, the appalling tragedy where Garda Tony Golden was murdered highlights the serious issue of domestic violence and domestic abuse.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader for a debate on Northern Ireland in light of yesterday's reports of paramilitary activity in the North.  As it happens, I will be in Stormont tomorrow and will speak at a conference in Belfast.  It is good that we have close links with our parliamentary colleagues in the North.  To that end, I ask the Leader to consider at our next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, what role the Seanad can play in supporting the peace process and bringing about the restoration of the institutions in Northern Ireland.  When former Senator Martin McAleese was here one of our speakers in the House was the head of the Orange Order.  There may be some other way in which the Seanad could support those who are trying to ensure there is a return to proper structures in the peace process and proper parliamentary structures in Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#H00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I, too, would welcome a debate on the North.  We debated the matter in this Chamber a number of weeks ago.  On that occasion the contributions made by most of the Senators were comprised of a long list of political charges against Sinn F&eacute;in.  Nothing constructive was offered on how to solve the problems with the peace process or successfully conclude the talks.<\/p> <p>I wish to respond directly to Senator MacSharry who asked about the claims made by MI5 in a report that has been published.  I recommend that people read the report in full and to not take their cue from headlines broadcast by the media or from anywhere else.  I urge people to read what the report actually says.  In the report MI5 shared its view that some members of the IRA believe or believed that the army council had a direction in regard to Sinn F&eacute;in.  I wish to state that is untrue.  I have been an elected member of the Ard Chomhairle of Sinn F&eacute;in for the past three years and I was elected on the floor of the Sinn F&eacute;in Ard-Fheis.  The media comes to my party's Ard-Fheis every year.  I am elected democratically by the membership of my party because that is how my party works.<\/p> <p>Senator MacSharry wants to talk about criminality.  I can tell him that the only political party that I am aware of that had, in its ranks, people who were convicted of criminality and for taking brown envelopes of cash and stuffing them into their pockets, is his own party.  These acts went to the very highest level of his party.  If he wants to have that debate then my party will have it with him.  As I said in this Chamber a number of weeks ago when we debated crime, it does not matter to me who is involved in criminality.  If some former members of the IRA are involved in crime then I believe they should be ruthlessly pursued by the authorities in the North and South.  Yesterday in the D&aacute;il, my party's justice spokesperson, of whom the Senator spoke about earlier, supported stronger cross-Border initiatives to bring these people to justice.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants such people brought before the courts and convicted.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in and its members have put their lives on the line by standing up to such individuals who are involved in criminality in the Border areas and in the North.  I contrast the leadership given by Martin McGuinness on all of these issues with the leadership of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party that has, for political and electoral reasons, taken a harder line than that of the DUP.  Let us contrast all of that with what Peter Robinson, MLA, said and did yesterday.  He is now back in the talks and he wants the DUP back in the Executive.  That is what we should focus on.<\/p> <p>I would welcome a constructive debate.  I hope that we look at the real issues and not at contrived crises which happens all of the time for political and electoral purposes.  We must identify the real issues of the peace process in the North that need to be addressed in the same spirit that was applied to the process which was supported by people like Bertie Ahern, Tony Blair, Martin McGuinness, MLA, Deputy Gerry Adams and Albert Reynolds.  All of those people were part of a constructive peace process.  Let us get back to that type of politics.  We must ensure that we make the agreements work, that institutions stay in place and that we have institutions in the North that work in the best interests of all communities.  I would welcome the debate and hope that the Leader can arrange it as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#H00300","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator MacSharry and with some aspects of what was said by Senator Cullinane.

I expected announcement of such an increase in last week's budget but I have not yet been able to get clarification on that matter.  There are huge concerns within the direct provision centres around the manner in which the working group report recommendations are being implemented, how that is being managed, who is in charge and so on.

This morning I attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications with the chairman designate of Sport Ireland, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, who reiterated at that meeting much of what he said during his interview on television last night.  What has emerged out of all of this is that the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, IABA, has serious questions to answer.  For the benefit of the House, it is funded almost totally by the Irish taxpayer and it is, therefore, accountable to the Irish taxpayer.  Last weekend the President of that organisation assured the Minister of State with responsibility for sport that the matter of Billy Walsh's tenure would be resolved.  Yet, two days later he tendered his letter of resignation.  There was much anger conveyed at the meeting this morning, not only by Mr. Mulvey but by members of the committee, in regard to the details which have emerged in the past week.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paschal Mooney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It was not about money.  Billy Walsh is a true patriot and did not wish to leave Ireland, but he is leaving tomorrow.  He is the best boxing coach in the world, as Mr. Mulvey put it, and from this small nation.  We are ranked fourth among boxing nations because of Mr. Walsh's tenure.  The point made by Mr. Mulvey which I would like to convey to the Minister is that the IABA showed disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring; the Irish Sports Council and the taxpayer.  This has to stop.  The organisation is dysfunctional and must be held to account.  Will the Leader convey this message to the Minister of State?  Perhaps there might be an opportunity for him to come before the House to outline the relationship between sports bodies and the Department in the context of the new sports body being set up.  It is important that we clarify what the relationship is.  Is it fair, right and equitable that all of the taxpayers' money is being given to an organisation that is getting rid of Billy Walsh because that is what it is doing?  The IABA has more or less stated it does not want him and that he can go.  As Mr. Mulvey said, it issued a crocodile tears statement yesterday that it regretted the matter and wished Billy Walsh the best of luck.  That is unacceptable.  To thumb the nose at the democratically elected Government of the country and the Minister of State who is responsible for providing sports governing bodies with taxpayers' money is not acceptable either.  In normal circumstances, I would table an amendment to the Order of Business to have the Minister of State brought before us because the departure of Billy Walsh is imminent, but I will not do so.  However, I strongly urge the Leader to convey these comments which I am sure are supported by all sides of the House to the Minister of State and to have the Minister of State to issue a public statement, possibly later today, outlining his plans for the future governance of the IABA and perhaps to take money off it and give it to the high performance unit as a separate autonomous body, as has been done in the United Kingdom, in order that the boxers will not suffer as a result of this and that the dysfunctional group of dinosaurs in the IABA is brought to account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#J01700","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I welcome the rounding to be introduced for one and two cent coins from 28 October.

Meanwhile, one in four teachers remarked that children's concentration levels had improved as a result.  Children are also feeling the benefits, with 57% of those aged between four and 12 years admitting to eating more fruit and vegetables and 64% saying they drank more water.

We are, therefore, starting from a positive perspective.  Not too many Members of this or the other House served when we had a daily diet of bombs, bullets, murders, condemnation, hopelessness and despair.  Therefore, let us not forget that we have moved a long way and that people on all sides and none have been responsible for this.  That must be the starting point.  There are very profound troubles to be addressed, but I have often made the point that if we can ensure the current generation, particularly in Northern Ireland, at least stops killing each other, perhaps the next might grow closer and that there will be a stronger community ethos and stronger and more normal politics.  That is what we must aim for.  The reports are significant and perhaps serious, but they are not really surprising because they simply tell us what we know.  We have been walking and dancing on egg shells for the past ten, 12 or 15 years so as not to cause difficulties, but we are reaching a stage where we must be a little more blunt in our analysis and discussions.

Is it not far better to deal with issues through mediation to come up with solutions rather than having to go into four goldmines to make millionaires of barristers and senior counsel?  Mediation services are in their infancy in this country and have to gain huge traction.  I commend all of the professionals who are working voluntarily this week to promote such services.

After so many years one would have thought we would have normality restored in Northern Ireland, but unfortunately that is not the case.

In doing that we cannot just forget the problems on the policing side and, as Senator Paul Coghlan, mentioned the <i>omerta<\/i>that seems to be in place - the fear in the community in south Armagh and other areas of people who seem to be policing it but who are not part of the actual police force of the area.<\/p><p>The matter will need to be addressed by both Governments - on this side of the Border and in particular on the other side of the Border.  There seems to be an absence of a police presence in those areas which is allowing these criminals to act with impunity.  The matter was addressed by the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly in a report last year which called for a task force to eliminate these criminals.  Some of them may have links with the Provisional IRA but there is no doubt that the army council is still in existence, as we all know.

As I stated on Committee Stage, the Government is fully committed to the elimination of corporal punishment and to protecting children from violence.  This amendment not only abolishes the defence of reasonable chastisement but will also convey a strong message which, I hope, will lead to a cultural change across society in Ireland that corporal punishment is wrong.<\/p> <p>Senator van Turnhout proposed an amendment in this regard on Committee Stage and I requested her to postpone the progressing of it until Report Stage in order that the work already well under way in my Department on this issue could be finalised.  I thank her for her co-operation in that regard.  This is a very important issue and it is one in respect of which we share an objective.  Many Members of the House who spoke on the issue on Committee Stage clearly share the same objective.  The Senator supports the amendment as brought forward by me today.<\/p> <p>I take this opportunity to mention the late John Boland, a former Deputy and predecessor of mine, who is survived by his widow, Kay.  On 26 January 1982, when he was Minister for Education, John Boland introduced a regulation banning corporal punishment in schools.  That regulation came into effect in February 1982.  We are joined in the Gallery by the relatives of the late Dr. Cyril Daly, whom I knew very well and who was also a great exponent of banning corporal punishment when it was neither popular nor profitable to do so.  As a result of his stance, Mr. Daly found himself in conflict with those powers that he held in such dear esteem.<\/p> <p>The amendment before the House provides for the total abolition of the common law defence of reasonable chastisement.  It does not create a new offence but rather removes something that has its roots in a completely different era and societal context.  The measure asserts: that there is no circumstance in which it may be seen to be in order to hit a vulnerable person, in this case a child; that from a child's perspective there is nothing reasonable about being on the receiving end of corporal punishment; that Irish parents are no less protective of their children, nor less progressive in their parenting practices, than those in the other 19 European countries where a statutory ban on corporal punishment is in place; that the Government, by its laws, will protect and vindicate the rights of children; and that Ireland is diligent as regards meeting its international obligations in the area of human rights.  The measure represents a significant advancement as regards the protection and rights of children.  It reinforces the developing impetus in parenting practices in Ireland to use positive discipline strategies in upbringing of children which reject the use of corporal punishment.<\/p> <p>The environment in which this amendment can be taken is one that takes account of the children's referendum.  The referendum marked a milestone in this country in regard to children.  The people voted in favour of children having rights and those rights that must be respected.  The action we take today is a further step in recognising those rights, making that amendment to our Constitution all the more real.<\/p> <p>I would also like to say a word about positive parenting where we support our children's self-discipline and behaviour by means of a learning strategy rather than through punishment.  Positive parenting is strongly advocated by many parenting support groups and programmes.  The Child and Family Agency, Tusla, has published a parenting support strategy which was launched in October 2013.  As part of that strategy, the agency has launched its 50 Key Messages document, which is an evidence-informed guide for parents and practitioners of keys messages that are important in the context of raising children.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Family resource centres around the country provide positive parenting programmes which people will find beneficial.

He is, however, particularly welcome today.  One of the first objectives I set when I became a Member in 2011 was for Ireland to repeal the defence of reasonable chastisement.  When the Seanad took Committee Stage of the Children First Bill on 23 September, I tabled an amendment, with thanks to the expert help of Dr. Fergus Ryan, to the same purpose as this amendment.  At the time the Minister said, &ldquo;If I have my way, we will have this defence of reasonable chastisement removed from the Statute Book&quot;.  Here we are today.<\/p><p>I am very aware of and thankful for all the work done by the Minister personally, by officials and advisers across the Government, co-operating and working together to bring about this amendment.  I extend my particular thanks to the officials of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I also thank my assistant and researcher, Amy McArdle, for all her work and support.  I was heartened on Committee Stage to receive cross-party and Independent support.  I thank my colleagues for that.  On 23 September, I cited several international and national experts.  I do not intend to repeat myself today but ask that my words on Committee Stage be included in any documenting of how Ireland brought about the abolition of the defence of reasonable chastisement.<\/p><p>Over the years, there have been notable voices to the fore calling for Ireland to take this step.  Of special note, I must thank the Childrens Rights Alliance, in particular Tanya Ward and Maria Corbett, who have been steadfast in their support and in ensuring the support of a wide range of children and youth organisations; the ISPCC, Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, driven by the experience of children calling into its Childline service, has always prioritised ending a culture of violence against children; and the special rapporteur on child protection, Professor Geoffrey Shannon, who has through his reports repeatedly called on us as legislators to repeal the defence of reasonable chastisement.<\/p><p>For the global leadership they have provided, I thank Marta Santos Pais, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General on Violence against Children; Peter Newell of the global initiative to end all corporal punishment of children; and Ireland&rsquo;s academics who have shone a light on Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations, in particular Professor Ursula Kilkelly of University College Cork.  I also thank Jenny and Michael Hassett, my mum and dad.  Since 23 September, I have had much time to reflect and probe why I am so passionate about this issue.  It is, of course, rooted in my own childhood.  My memories brought me back to a particular primary school teacher who would, on occasion, whack someone in our class across the ears with a ruler.  I remember telling my mum.  She said that if I was ever hit, I was to stand up calmly, walk out of the class, go to the office of the school secretary and ask for my parents to be called to come and collect me.  I was lucky.  My parents were ahead of their time.  They respected me as an independent rights holder.  I thank my mum for being here today to share this momentous occasion.<\/p><p>Why do we as a society accept that we even debate if and when it is acceptable to hit someone, let alone when that someone is smaller than us and probably does not understand why they are being hit?  Very often, when we discuss the issue of corporal punishment, violence against children, or so-called &ldquo;slapping&rdquo;, one can almost feel an invisible line appear in people&rsquo;s heads about their tolerance level.  They say, &ldquo;You know I am only talking about a tap, not a thump, a slap, not a belt, a smack, not a whack&rdquo;.  Of course, the issue is wrapped up in how we were raised.  All too often the knee-jerk reaction of &quot;it never did me any harm&quot; is heard.  I would add it never did people any good either.<\/p><p>This invisible line is very subjective and it leaves children vulnerable.  When someone hits a child, it is not happening from a rational place.  The decision is made in a heightened emotional state, when we are stressed, when we are tired and least able to engage sound and reasoned judgment.  The invisible line gets blurred.  In extreme cases, it gets rubbed out completely.  One way or another, the existence of the invisible line means children are all too often exposed to an escalation of violence.  The excuse, &ldquo;I got a terrible fright when she ran out on the road and so I just hit her to show how wrong it is&rdquo; is used with children.  We all get frights in our life but my first reaction is not to hit someone.  Why do we culturally accept that it is okay when it is a child?  A caller to the &ldquo;Last Word with Matt Cooper&rdquo; on Today FM summed it up by saying, &ldquo;My grandmother has Alzheimer&rsquo;s and she is as likely to walk out into traffic or harm herself.  Should I use that as a reason to slap her?&rdquo;<\/p><p>Of course, I understand the importance of supporting parents in the vital role they play in their child&rsquo;s life.  We need to ensure parents have access to supports and resources when they need them.  We know the majority of parents already believe we have a ban on corporal punishment.  However, I know some parents are anxious about this change in the law.  I reassure them that we all want the best for their children, for the children of Ireland.  To this end, I would like to take this moment to thank Laura Haugh of <i>mummypages.ie<\/i>for its unequivocal support of the amendment.  I would also like to point to an excellent book for any parents who are anxious, developed by a leading advocate in this area, Paul Gilligan.  His book, <i>Raising Emotionally Healthy Children<\/i>, is a great resource which provides much advice and support.<\/p><p>By abolishing the defence of reasonable chastisement, we are giving life to the children&rsquo;s amendment in our Constitution, Article 42A.1, which states: &quot;The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights.&quot;  We know that corporal punishment can cause serious harm to children, teaches them that violence is an acceptable way of solving conflicts and is ineffective as a means of discipline.  We know there are positive ways to teach, correct or discipline children which are better for the child&rsquo;s development and health.  Corporal punishment makes it more difficult to protect children from severe abuse if some forms of violence are legitimate.  With this amendment, we are ensuring that all citizens are equal in the eyes of the law.<\/p><p>This ancient defence of reasonable chastisement is not an Irish invention.  It came to us from English common law.  Through its colonial past, England has been responsible for rooting this legal defence in over 70 countries and territories throughout the world.  In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the reasonable punishment defence still allows parents and some other carers to justify common assault on children.  In Scotland, there is another variation, namely, the defence of justifiable assault.  In this action being taken today, the Government is putting children first and providing leadership, which will hopefully give confidence to the Government at Westminster, the devolved UK Administrations and other countries across the globe to discard these archaic and disreputable defences and give full respect to the dignity of children.<\/p><p>Ireland will be the 20th EU member state to effectively ban corporal punishment in our jurisdiction.  In doing so, I hope the remaining European governments will follow suit.  Irish law is being brought into step with parents, children&rsquo;s rights advocates and international best practice.  With this amendment we have a way to unite and agree that all citizens are equal.  There must never be a defence for violence against children.  I am honoured to have championed and secured the effective ban on the physical punishment of children in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#R00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his senior staff to the Chamber today.

What is happening here certainly proves a point.  If there were no Seanad, this amendment would not have been included because nobody in the Lower House sought to move it.  No Deputy decided to pursue it in the manner in which Senator van Turnhout has done.  Had this House been abolished, the amendment would never have been moved.  There would have been no amendment and the current position would have continued to obtain.  The latter is a worthwhile point and the people recognised.  The Minister is following in the footsteps of his late colleague from north Dublin, John Boland, who brought about the abolition of corporal punishment in schools.  This was a major innovation, particularly as all Members, including the Minister, will recall being in school and the fear and terror we experienced.  I attended a Christian Brothers school and I have a great deal of respect for that order.  I will never attack the Christian Brothers because they gave me a good start in life.  I refer, in particular, to Brother O'Dwyer, who gave me great support at school and who I have always regarded highly.  Nevertheless, the Christian Brothers had leather straps made which allowed members of the order to inflict maximum torture on pupils.  I recall the fear of getting \"six of the best\", as it was called, and seeing teachers standing on their tiptoes in order to inflict the maximum pain.  That has stayed in my memory.  This fear was not just for myself because I was not punished that much although, like every child in the class, I was given six of the best at some stage.  I wish to recognise the name of John Boland in the Chamber today.  Mr. Boland was a former colleague of the Minister in north Dublin and I presume he knew him well.  John Boland was the Minister who brought about the abolition of corporal punishment at a time when there was a lot of resistance to the proposal.  Looking back, was it not right that it was abolished?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#R00300","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#S00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Teachers could physically abuse pupils in front of their peers in the classroom.  If I look back to my own childhood, it was like that of Senator van Turnhout, who was blessed with her mother and father and the manner in which they gave her support.  That support has built her up and given her the courage to bring forward these amendments.  However, I recall going home to a loving mother - my father was a stonemason and worked away from home a great deal -  who was there to greet me with a cup of tea and some biscuits.  I looked forward to that moment.  There was never fear in my home and I was fortunate in that regard.  Moreover, one continues with the example one receives with one's own family and that was something to which we never needed to resort.  It is nothing about which to boast but I was fortunate this did not arise.<\/p> <p>I wish to make one point in respect of which the Minister might respond.  This provision should not lead to overuse or abuse of the resources of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, a reasonable approach should be taken.  One might call it a phasing-in approach whereby people will be aware of the position, will not abuse the law and will not be able to resort to this defence if they are actually challenged or if charges are brought against them.  It is important that from the time the President signs this Bill into law, anyone who sees a child being abused, by a parent or otherwise, will have the right - and will use that right - to inform a member of the Garda that wrongdoing is taking place and that the law is being broken.  I refer to public demonstrations of abuse which will be quite evident, which one can foresee and about which one can do something.  Privately and internally, a child will be able to contact the helpline, which is fine, but the Minister should be aware of this point.  The publicity that will arise from this provision and parents' awareness of it will go a long way toward achieving compliance and ensuring that parents will not use force against, abuse or slap their children .  There are many other ways to do it.  Every family is different but this is an important development and I am delighted to be associated with it.<\/p> <p>I again congratulate Senator van Turnhout on her initiative in tabling this amendment.  In particular, I congratulate the Minister and his officials.  I presume this measure was approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday last, so I take this opportunity to compliment the Cabinet as well.  I do so because this may not be as popular in some quarters as it might be in others.  However, popularity does not matter - we are concerned with the rights of children.  As the Senator noted, why pass a referendum without introducing this measure?  In a sense, there was a contradiction in that the people approved a children's rights amendment without something being done to protect children in their homes or otherwise.  I again say \"Well done\" and offer my congratulations.  I thank the Minister for going along with this amendment in the House.  It shows his independence of thought and his ability as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I have great faith in the Minister's ability and long may he continue his work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#S00300","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I wish to add my voice to the welcome for this amendment.  I also wish to welcome the Minister and thank him, in particular, for accepting the amendment.  He gave Members great heart on Committee Stage when he stated that if he had his way, the amendment would be accepted.  I spoke at length on this amendment on Committee Stage but I reiterate my thanks and appreciation to Senator van Turnhout for the work she put into it.  She has been the driving force behind the amendment.  One sometimes might hear people stating that a Senator was not elected to the Seanad but instead was nominated or whatever.  Senator van Turnhout has proved today why she was nominated to be a Member of this House.  She brought her expertise with her - having worked with the Children's Rights Alliance - and now, having utilised it, she has accomplished what she set out to achieve.  Today, I am proud to be part of the Government which has accepted this amendment.  I speak on behalf of all my Labour Party colleagues, who support fully this amendment and are delighted that it has been accepted.  I am sure our leader, Senator Bacik, will reaffirm this point when she speaks later.<\/p> <p>In recent weeks I have discussed this proposal with people and have told them what is happening.  Approximately 99% of them were in agreement with the proposal and stated that it is fantastic and represents a great move on the part of the Senator.  Some others have shown a little reservation about it.  One point that arose continually relates to people's concern with regard to how it will be policed and how we will know if children are being slapped at home.  I recall that when the smoking ban was introduced, people thought it would never be possible to police it.  However, the ban came into force and it worked.  Moreover, because it involved an entire cultural change, it stopped people smoking in private houses.  People who visit my home will go outside for a fag.  I have never stopped them from so doing because I do not really like it in the house.  Although there was no obligation on them to leave a private house to go out and smoke, they did so nevertheless.  The smoking ban appears to have involved a culture change for people and I believe that what is proposed here will also involve a culture change.  That change will focus people's minds on the issue.  They can concentrate and conclude they can no longer slap a child.  Regardless of how gentle one might be in doing so, one cannot slap a child.  I believe that 99% of the people are honourable and will abide by this law.  I thank all those present in the Gallery who have put a lot of work into this measure in conjunction with Senator van Turnhout, the Minister and his officials.

It is a good day for Ireland and the State that the passage of the Bill before us through the Houses is reaching its conclusion.  I sat on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for the first two years in which I served in the Seanad and it was an issue the Minister constantly supported and raised.  He received full co-operation in respect of it from my party, as well as cross-party support and support from the Independent groupings and that has helped us reach the position at which we have arrived today.  I also commend Senator van Turnhout on her eloquent contribution.  Her tabling of these amendments, which the Minister has accepted, means this is a good day for the Seanad and for governance in this State.  It is far too often the case that what we are witnessing today does not happen because although reasonable amendments are tabled, they are not accepted as a result of the fact that they are put forward by the Opposition.  I am pleased that on this occasion the amendments before the House are being accepted.<\/p> <p>It also is important to state that we have come a long way during the past 30 years in how we deal with issues pertaining to children's rights.  This culminated in the referendum which, again, my party supported.  It was fantastic to see that referendum proposal being passed, even though many people, for all sorts of spurious reasons, did not support it.  I am proud Sinn F&eacute;in supported it.  I am glad that the Opposition and Government parties which supported the referendum proposal on a collective basis managed to get it over the line.<\/p> <p>In many respects, this Bill flows from that referendum outcome and strengthens the safeguarding of children.  It puts key elements of the Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children of 2011 on a statutory footing.  It also introduces mandatory reporting of child protection concerns for key groups of people that provide services to children.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Cullinane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Many thousands of children in this State and across the island have been abused.  Many of them were failed by organisations and the State.  We have all learned many valuable lessons on how we deal with those issues.  That is for the good of all concerned.<\/p><p>I welcome the important amendments to remove the defence of reasonable chastisement from the Statute Book.  It is a good day for the State.  I will not say what year I was in because that might give away who the teacher was but in one of the years when I was in primary school, we had a teacher who had a long stick and who used it occasionally to smack all of the children in the class.  There was only one teacher in the entire school at that time who used the stick.  Fortunately, that does not happen any more.  That shows we are progressing all the time.<\/p><p>Reference was made to parents who smack or use a correction to chastise a child.  I have two children, one of whom is aged eight and the other is four.  They can be very trying at times, like anyone else's children.  They try my patience but I have never once raised my hand to either of my children and I never will.  However, I will not demonise people who see it as valid to give a child a slight smack.  I do not agree with it; it is wrong.  What we need to do is to deal with it in legislation to make sure that it is not right and that we send out a message collectively from the Oireachtas that we do not tolerate such behaviour any more.  While a person might consider it to be the right thing for him or her to do, that he or she is not doing anything wrong or that this is the way he or she wishes to chastise his or her child, it does not work, it is not right and it is not fair.  We have all seen parents in pubs or at open air events give a child of two or three years of age a smack.  That is most unfair and it is not the way we should chastise children when they do wrong.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister on the significant work he has done.  He should be commended on this personal achievement.  The Government should also be commended, as should all of the Senators who have done their own work on it.

I welcome the Minister.  He has always been a great servant of children.  The children of Ireland are well served by him.  When he was Minister for Health he took steps to ban smoking by adults where children were present in cars.  He listened most attentively on Committee Stage to what Members said.  I was in his company on that sad occasion last Thursday.  Everybody who was at Garda Golden's funeral was moved by the two year-old, three year-old and five year-old children following their father's hearse.

Cyril Daly campaigned for this for many years, a point to which the Minister referred on Committee Stage.  His statement on it was that to Cyril Daly the Irish child is a human being with human rights.  Children have those rights from today as they are now enforced in legislation.<\/p><p>Like the Minister, I remember John Boland, who as Minister for education in the 1980s introduced the measure on corporal punishment, against substantial opposition.  I also mention Owen Skeffington, one of my predecessors as a Trinity Senator.  I gather the Daly family has correspondence from Senator Skeffington.  I mentioned previously during the debate the famous story that someone said he was beaten in school and it never did him any harm and the Senator's response was  &quot;The question is what did do the harm.&quot;  We have moved away from that approach - <i>Tom Brown's School Days<\/i>, the fag system and the Victorians with the spare the rod and spoil the child attitude.  Since the views of educationalists such as Maria Montessori we now see children are interesting, fascinating, inspiring, stimulating.  Why on earth would we want to impose any form of physical punishment on them?<\/p><p>Senator Moloney was deeply moving in her contribution on the previous day's debate.  She always is when she speaks in support of Senator van Turnhout on such issues.  Senator Leyden said it would be a suitable way to commemorate the centenary of 1916.  One of the best suggestions in that regard is that children will be cherished, as in the democratic programme of that D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>This is a significant day for human rights in this country.

In its way it is as big a celebration as the one we were celebrating last night in the context of the celebrations in Dublin Castle on 23 May.  This one is even bigger when on thinks of the number of people who will benefit in the future from what the Minister is doing here today.  I commend the Minister very strongly for making this change and for remembering reading notes in the <i>Irish Medical Times<\/i>from Dr. Daly, whom he knew personally as a friend.  He also knew John Boland as a friend.  These friendships do matter.  They make us question whose children should be punished and why was that power given to big people to beat small people.  We have moved away from all of that now.

With this amendment, the section would provide that a mandated person would include a person employed in a preschool service within the meaning of Part VIIA of the Child Care Act 1991, &quot;including a person taking care of one or more children (other than that person's own such children) in that person's home, but not including any such person who is a relative of the child or children or the spouse of such relative&quot;.  We dealt with this issue on Committee Stage and believed there was reason to bring it forward again on Report Stage as a number of other amendments had been submitted.  The problem for us is that the Bill defines a mandated person as a person &quot;employed in a pre-school service within the meaning of Part VIIA of the Child Care Act 1991&quot;.  Part VIIA of the Child Care Act includes childminders caring for four or more children, other than their own, but exempts childminders caring for three or fewer children.  The aim of the amendment is to ensure inclusion of childminders caring for three or fewer children while still excluding relatives.

Amendment No. 3 proposes to include a person taking care of one or more children in his or her home who is not a relative of the child.  One of the reasons a person taking care of a child in his or her home is not a mandated person under the Bill is that the categories of persons set out in Schedule 2 were included in the Schedule on the basis of their professional qualifications and ongoing contact with children.  The focus on a small, qualified cadre of mandated reporters will, based on evidence, improve the quality of reports made to the agency.  The receipt by it of better quality reports from persons who, by virtue of their training, qualifications and professional experience, are well equipped to recognise harm to a child is likely to have a positive effect on the process of assessments of the risk for a child.  The list of mandated persons was developed following detailed consideration of both the objectives of the legislation and the reserach paper on how mandatory reporting was dealt with internationally.  As indicated, as the persons included in the list have been selected on the basis of their qualifications, role and professional expertise, it means that they are aware of risks to children and their responsibilities in that regard.  It is anticipated that reports from these persons are likely to be of a high quality, which will assist the agency in carrying out assessments of risk in a more effective and efficient manner.<\/p> <p>The reason childminders are not included in the requirement for mandatory reporting is that the childminding sector is not homogenous and a wide variety of arrangements, including personal family arrangements, pertain.  In that context, it was considered overly onerous to impose a mandatory requirement on such a heterogeneous group of providers.  However, it is important to note that, while not required to do so under the legislation, any person can and should report any concern about a child to the agency in accordance with the Children First national guidance which will operate in tandem with the legislation.  This position applies to childminders as well to as any other person who has contact with a specific child or children, whether in the context of service provision or otherwise.  In comparison, the formal childminding sector, namely, cr&egrave;ches, will be covered by requirements relating to child safeguarding statements and mandated reporting.  <\/p> <p>The Senator's concern to protect this group of children should be alleviated by the fact that there are many other professionals in contact with this group of children, including nurses who are mandated persons and GPs.  In this regard, the recent extension of GP medical cards to children under six years of age should ensure greater contact between this group of children and their GPs.  This is shortly to be extended further to under-12s next year.  GPs are also mandated persons under the legislation.  For these reasons, I am not accepting the amendment.<\/p> <p>On what Senator Terry Leyden had to say about Garda resources and so forth, in other jurisdictions mandated reporting of this nature has led to a massive increase in reporting, with no increase in prosecutions or real cases being identified.

We are all very pleased and honoured to be in the House today.  Is it not amazing that it took so long?  When the then Minister, the late John Boland, brought this forward, it was not as widely accepted as we may think.  In fact, there would have been much resistance to it and educationalists felt the classrooms would be chaotic, that there would be no discipline, no power and no control but he proved them all wrong.

They seek to set targets rather than aspirations.  We had some lengthy exchanges on Second Stage when I outlined the major flaws in the Bill, one of which is the fact that while the Bill is high on rhetoric and aspiration it is very low on setting targets.  That makes a mockery of bringing forward a Bill on climate change because the whole point of doing something on climate change is to put in place targets for actions that will reach a conclusion and deliver something.  If we do not do that there is no incentive to design a plan to bring about meaningful reductions.<\/p><p>It is interesting that other amendments tabled by me and Opposition Members that would embody and set targets within an agreed timeframe have been ruled out of order.  That is a matter for the Cathaoirleach but I find it strange.  When discussing the need for this Bill and in its report on what it should contain, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht set out clearly that this State needs to have targeted reductions in line with the international agreements the State has signed up to.<\/p><p>I read contributions on this issue in the D&aacute;il even before this Government was elected and in other committees which have discussed the issue, and much of what I am saying about the need to set targets and the flaws in this Bill are precisely what both Government parties were saying was necessary to bring about a strategic, overarching but realistic and deliverable climate change plan.  The Government seems to have turned all that on its head.  Who is really driving this; civil servants, people in the Department or is the Government in the driving seat at all for this Bill? <\/p><p>The absence of such targets means that this Bill lacks any real power to ensure that meaningful steps are taken to address the issues involved in bringing about a reduction in CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions across the main economic sectors.  Some groups and special interests lobby strongly against setting targets and that might have been part of the influence.  It would be interesting if the Minister of State would set out in detail why targets were not set and why a Bill was designed that is high on aspiration but very poor and shallow in respect of tangible targets.  That is a fundamental criticism of the Bill supported by many organisations outside the Seanad which have campaigned and lobbied for climate change action for many years.  They also feel this Bill falls far short of what is necessary.

In the context of this amendment and the Bill in general, what moves is the Government making to reduce that very high dependence?  For example, will wind energy, which is very controversial in this country, make much of an impact?  I welcome that today the Government has allocated &euro;3.5 million to a number of pioneers in the area of wave energy.  There are three Irish companies involved in this regard, including one in Galway.<\/p><p>I was a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly sub-committee that prepared a paper on wave energy.  I believe at the time the Minister of State was a member of that committee and will be familiar with it.  I know it is a long way down the road.  When we were taking evidence, the expert witnesses told us we were at same the stage of wave energy development as the Wright brothers were when they were trying to get a plane off the ground for the first time.  So it is at that very pioneering level.  That was a bit of a shock to the system and somewhat disappointing because I thought that, with the way technology is moving so fast, we would have reached a much higher level of development.  However, that is how matters stand.  The Government is obviously committed to developing wave energy.  Owing to its location, Ireland seems to have the best possible environment for the development of wave energy - primarily off our Atlantic coast.  I think it is the best in the world.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 2 refers to \"an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.\"  It is often stressed that the herd numbers in the country and the high levels of CO2 those animals discharge, through a variety of sources, are adding to our high levels of carbon emissions.  While I am not an expert in agriculture, am I correct in stating that, with technology and through the mix of foodstuffs, we are having some success in reducing the amount of carbon emissions from our cattle herd?  The Minister of State may have a comment to make on that because it is certainly a contributory factor.<\/p><p>Further to Senator Barrett's point about the need to achieve the targets proposed by the Government, I seem to recall that the targets we set ourselves for 2005 or 2010 under the Kyoto agreement, way back in the day, were reached primarily because of the rapid decline in our economic activity rather than any attempts by Government at the time to reduce it.  Now that economic activity is picking up again, is the Minister of State concerned that this may pose a challenge and the Government's ambitious targets might be compromised to a degree?  I appreciate she cannot wave a magic wand on the issue and we need to consider the long term.  In an international context, Ireland would not be the worst offender in this regard.  That is why we all welcome the proposals in the Bill.  I just wanted to raise those points in the context of the amendment and I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#CC00600","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>As Members are aware the word \"target\" has come into this debate on a number of occasions and there are many targets.  For example, the Europe 2020 strategy contains a European target for cutting emissions at a European level and so forth.

While we can all aspire and targets can be very motivating, at the end of the day we have signed up to a number of international treaties that are binding on the country.  This legislation has been a long time coming and has been welcomed by every organisation in the field.  It is good legislation and it should not be undermined by defining in legislation things that I do not believe can be enshrined in legislation and which are purely targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#DD00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":146,"content":"<p>The proposed amendments seek to include, in some fashion, domestic greenhouse gas mitigation targets in the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 seek to include a definition of \"low-carbon\" which has effectively been borrowed from the Government's national policy position on climate action and low-carbon development, as published in April 2014.  It goes without saying that I stand over the vision of low-carbon transition outlined in the national policy position document.  Further to an amendment introduced on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, section 32B contains an explicit reference to the need to have regard to the Government's policy on climate change.  However, I do not accept that the content of the national policy position should be replicated in statute.  This is because Ireland is already subject to legally binding greenhouse gas mitigation targets up to 2020.  Negotiations at EU level are ongoing to agree mitigation targets for all member states up to 2030.  This process of target setting is likely to continue up to 2050.  Accordingly, putting in place our own statutory mitigation target for 2050 now would be likely to cut across and interfere with the EU's target-setting process.  The result would either be that our target would be below that of the EU, rendering it redundant, or that it would be above the EU target, indicating that it is not a least-cost option thereby putting Ireland at a competitive disadvantage with our EU neighbours.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 3 calls for the insertion of a mitigation target for 2050 in order to secure an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of at least 80% by 2050.  As already stated, I am opposed to setting a quantitative target for 2050 separate from that to be set for us as part of an EU target-setting process.  Moreover, I believe that a single economy-wide target for the State is quite inappropriate, giving our unique emissions profile.  This profile is characterised by a large agricultural sector where mitigation potential is low.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 39 calls for the inclusion of a target of close to 100% decarbonisation of transport, construction and energy sectors, and carbon neutrality in agriculture by 2050.  This is a grossly unreasonable expectation in respect of any country.  If it were taken seriously, it would decimate the economy and society.  Although substantive decarbonisation of approximately 80% may be achievable outside the agricultural sector by 2050, the marginal abatement cost of achieving close to 100% decarbonisation by 2050 would be truly enormous, even assuming it would be technically feasible in light of the state of low-carbon technologies currently available.<\/p> <p>Accordingly I cannot support these amendments and call for their withdrawal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#DD00300","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":147,"content":"<p>We certainly will not be withdrawing these amendments.

That obviously led to much more use of recycling and reusing of waste.  Unfortunately, many of those targets were set by Europe and not by the State.  We were dragged, kicking and screaming, to take action in respect of some of those issues.  However, targets were set and met.  A number of local authorities in the State were brought to court for not reaching those targets and being in breach of European legislation.<\/p> <p>It is not fair to say that legislation is not a place for setting targets.

This should be ready to go now.  The Paris conference will take place in about five or six weeks' time and asking for a further delay of 18 months is unreasonable.

The original timeframe in the Bill was set at 24 months after enactment.  However, having regard to concerns in this respect, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, introduced an amendment on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il to reduce the timeframe to 18 months.  I realise a timeframe of 18 months may not be short enough for some.

The Bill does not make reference to any particular mitigation policy measure for good reason in that the nature and extent of such measures will change over time and up to the year 2050, as successive mitigation measures take effect.

We must have independence of thought and action.  People within the broad bureaucracy seem to act in union.  That was a feature of the banking crisis, where they called those who disagreed with them the contrarians and marginalised them.  That kind of consensus can be extremely dangerous.  Let us take the first member of the advisory council, the director general of the EPA.  The advisory council may wish to make reflections, good, bad or indifferent, about the EPA.  Sustainable Energy Ireland may also have widely differing views about energy policy, given we regularly have widely differing views on the issue in this House and some of the most stimulating debates we have are on various energy factors.  In both of those cases, why do the insiders get automatic seats on the advisory council?  The situation is more serious with regard to Teagasc, which is an agricultural development agency charged with the task of promoting agriculture, which is a major source of pollution.  Therefore, I think that body is compromised.  The last body is the ESRI, on which the evidence Professor John FitzGerald gave to the banking inquiry illustrates my point.  When the Department of Finance did not like what the ESRI was doing, somebody rang up and complained, and that person was code-named &quot;Nervous Nellie&quot;.<\/p><p>The quangos in this case must be independent of the centre and there is no evidence that they are.  They are subject to group-think.  I would prefer to have genuinely independent people from bodies like the Royal Irish Academy and the environmental science departments in the universities, and not have four positions reserved for people from the bureaucracy.  We may have to correct the bureaucracy to solve the problems of climate change.  We need to bring in the international expertise of the scientific community and not have it confined to those who are already public sector insiders, some of whom may have conflicts of interest and some of whom are already under the thumb of their parent Departments, and have a record of not thinking and certainly not speaking independently.  That would be an extremely damaging precedent to set.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#OO01300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":253,"content":"<p>The make-up and membership of the advisory council is one of the main flaws in this legislation and it flies in the face of what the Bill is trying to achieve.

That section of the licence agreement was subsequently deleted and a licence without any bond was granted.  I do not trust the EPA or its director general.

A student at Oxford once told Albert Einstein that he had set the same examination questions as in the previous year.  Einstein said the questions may have been the same but that physics had moved on and that, therefore, the answers would be &quot;very different&quot;.  It is how we answer things that may change.<\/p><p>We all know that it is an irreversible fact that we are going to get old.  We need more creative and imaginative solutions to how our elders are treated.  &quot;We fail in clearness of vision or in boldness of heart or in singleness of purpose&quot; - these are not my words but of P&aacute;draig Pearse in <i>The Murder Machine<\/i>.  The American writer Kurt Vonnegut wrote a book called <i>A Man Without a Country<\/i>.  I do not subscribe to the premise, but in the book he speaks about how the most terrifying characters in history were the most enthralling and great guessers.  The most profound and loud guessing is happening in parts of Europe and other countries.  Our international leaders are sometimes completely unaware of solid information, research, scholarship, investigative reporting and downright common sense.  The guessers know no more than the ordinary common man, but they give the illusion - I may be talking with the benefit of age - that we are in control of our destiny when we are not, especially when we get old.<\/p><p>My first point is that we cannot continue to guess our way around the profound topic of ageing, from a European or a national point of view.  The topic of ageing is far more important than all of the shouting and roaring about water charges.  The population has been getting older in the past 30 years, hence the rise in concern about hospital beds, including step-down beds, step-up beds and bed blockers, as well as nursing homes and primary care services.  This problem has been coming for the past two or three decades; it did not just arise yesterday.  How we plan for the future is becoming the big reality.  As a nation we are very bad at planning; we write plans and give them a language and then shelve them.  We rarely activate them.  That is the reason 68% of us do not have a will.  If ever Ireland or politics needed a more compassionate, imaginative and creative way forward it is on the issue of ageing, but we keep putting aside the big issues.  If I was to leave a dog alone at home for three days, the ISPCA would be called and it would become an animal rights issue.  An older person, however, can be left at home for three or four days, or die on their own.  This is a human rights abuse and it happens all the time.  It also happens all the time in institutions; people are unwillingly in institutions, without visits.<\/p><p>In 1999 Ireland signed up to the United Nations Principles for Older Persons, yet current policy is geared towards incubating and congregating older people in long-term care settings.  Government policies must help them to live in an anti-fragile world.  We should not accept that we will wither away in an unacceptable way because of financial and human costs.<\/p><p>When I was young, I was very interested in Greek drama, from which all great dramas rose.  They always had a king or a young man, a princess or a young woman, or a group and no matter what happened in a society, be it through greed, jealousy or war, at the end the elders would always come on the stage and say, &quot;You should have listened; we told you that you needed to be careful about what you did and the decisions you made.&quot;  They always offered solace, wisdom and hope.  We need to listen to our elders who have been ostracised and silenced.  We know that they have been silenced in the financial sense, as poverty silences people, as does the old age pension.  They might be frail and not have the language or the voice, but we have to listen to what they tell us about how they feel about their lives.<\/p><p>In much of the world average lifespan is past 80 years and rising.  More than half of us live without a spouse and a partner.  We are also having fewer children, which is another source of concern.  Are the autumn days of our lives to be spent in institutions and nursing homes, with intensive care routines?  I understand it is not always possible for people to live at home, but I argue the case for greater balance, in favour of staying at home.  There are complicated medical needs, against which I do not argue.  There is a great book in which all Senators might be interested, or the Minister of State may have read it.  It is called <i>Being Mortal <\/i>by Atul Gawande.  It is a brilliant book on ageing.  Atul Gawande believes that in some way we have allowed our fate to be controlled by medicine, technology and strangers and he is right.  There are those who may think it is a little extreme, but sometimes one needs to be extreme to find common ground.<\/p><p>I am not attacking nursing homes, as they are outstanding in the care they provide, but we need to look more at saving money by using the same ideas, polices and solutions within the home.  We need to look at the phenomenon of ageing in other ways.  For example, what about having a fair deal scheme package with appropriate care being provided in one's home?  The person concerned could still pay at the rate of 7.5%, 14% or  21%.  What about having a direct payment scheme for those to decide who they want to mind them in order that they will not always be looked after by people who can often change?  My family and I are a living example.  Every week, sometimes every day, the people concerned can change.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2390\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2390&amp;amp;pid=MarieLouiseODonnell&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Old age should be multi-generational but has become somewhat private.  It is the private aspect which I am trying to twist and turn.  We need to reverse this.  Age is no longer rare.  The wisdom of age is somewhat ignored.  There was an example of this recently with the retirement of the great transplant surgeon, David Hickey, who was not allowed to stay on, even as a mentor, at 65 years of age.  Senator John Crown has a Bill to allow those who are able and have the capacity to be allowed stay at work.<\/p><p>Google explains everything to us.  The wisdom of experience is explained through Google, not through the experience of a human being&rsquo;s age.  Philip Roth, the novelist, said old age is not a battle but a massacre.  The older I get, the more I know what he is talking about.  The Government should not add to the massacre.  Depression is rife among older people.  We rarely hear about it because it is the preserve of another chronology.  We are not educating enough doctors to study gerontology.  It is the least sought after medical specialism in America.<\/p><p>Nursing homes cost five times more than independent living.  This comes back to my point about the fair deal scheme.  Did nursing homes really find their route in giving ageing people a better way of life, better than what they had in their other lives?  No.  They were created to clear out hospital beds.  The place where we are most likely to spend some part of the frail last years of our lives was never really created for us.  I fully accept we have quality and standards in nursing homes and that they are safe.  However, it is not happy sometimes.  A person might have left their apartment but is no longer allowed to do things because they are not safe.  One might have made one&rsquo;s own jewellery.  Now, that person just plays bingo, watches a DVD and has passive entertainment but not purpose.  Health and safety has closed down much of the creativity in nursing homes and what older people can do there.  The elderly have less freedom than children.<\/p><p>What we forgot in all our protection in health and safety was how to make life worth living.  The elderly are frail, weak and cannot argue for themselves.  People like us are here to argue for them.  Why have we not burned the nursing homes to the ground?  There is one here in Dublin that I would burn to the ground.  It is because we do not really believe that anything else is possible.  We believe it is sort of possible under certain conditions.  This comes back to P&aacute;draig Pearse and the lack of clear vision.<\/p><p>We need to develop assisted living as the norm, building it in every village and town.  I believe when one is away from home, one has lost one&rsquo;s freedom, no matter what one&rsquo;s age.  I also believe older people should never disburse decision-making to their children.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 will be very helpful here.  Children are not in charge of their parents.  Neither are nursing homes.  Elders are in charge of themselves, even when they lack capacity because there was a time when they did have capacity and they can make those decisions.  In the lobby of Leinster House, the Proclamation stands.  It talks about human rights.  This is one.<\/p><p>Privatisation of home care means that one hour of home care costs &euro;25 per hour.  At 168 hours a week that comes to &euro;4,200.  In 2026, 16% of the population will be over 65.  We now have what are termed young-old, people between 65 and 74 years of age, middle-old, 75 to 84, and old-old, 85 years up.  That is how long we are living.  If one buys into fair deal, one cannot reverse one&rsquo;s decision.<\/p><p>There are 36,000 people in nursing homes, equivalent to the population of Sligo town.  According to the ALONE report, some 12,000 of these people do not need to be there.  Up to 12% of elders in nursing homes engage in passive suicide.  I saw it myself.  Up to 57% of the budget for older person services is being allocated to just 6% of the older population.  The percentage of the elder population in nursing home care in Ireland is 35% greater than the EU average.  In the past five years, there has been a significant decrease in supports for older people to age at home.  The supports have been cut by &euro;1.6 million and the housing adaptation grant by &euro;30 million.  I understand everything had to be cut but we must start reversing that.  There is too much money going to 80% of stand-alone nursing homes.  We need to parallel that money in the communities.  We put people&rsquo;s names down for nursing homes because we do not know or have not developed good home-care supports.  The average length people stay in a nursing home is two and a half to three years.  There is no incentive to reverse that pattern.  Strategies are no guarantee of implementation.<\/p><p>We wait for occupational therapists to tell us what we already know.  We are not acting like a smart economy but like the bad economy of bad health.  I have just read the WHO report on ageing and health in which Dr. Margaret Chan, director-general of WHO, stated, \"There is no &ldquo;typical&rdquo; older person ... older age does not imply dependence\".  We need less emphasis on congregated care and more on community care.<\/p><p>Almost 2,000 years ago St. John said, &ldquo;When you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and others will dress you and take you where you do not want to go\".  I rest my case.  I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is in the Chamber because she has a genuine interest in our elders.  I would like to see policies reversed with fewer stand-alone nursing homes.  Instead, I would like more care in the community where the elders deserve to be, in the core of what they built themselves in their lives and want to come back to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#RR00300","speaker":"1170","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I second the motion.  I thank my colleague, Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, for tabling this motion and helping us understand the rationale behind it.  We all know it instinctively but she has hit it home for us all.  I have long been a believer in balancing our supports and the need to invest more in community services.  We tend to put an overemphasis on the medicalisation of too many issues, when we actually need to look at the humanisation of those issues to ensure people can get the help where they need it.<\/p> <p>I am delighted to second this motion.  My own father is in a nursing home.  I have nothing against nursing homes.  He had a severe stroke and is high dependency but getting high-quality care.  However, there was a period when he should have been getting care in the community but it was not there.  That is why tonight I have chosen to drill down in one area to illustrate why I am so honoured to second the motion.<\/p> <p>Four years ago the Government launched its strategy, National Policy and Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015.  As the title suggests, the intended lifetime of this policy ends in two months&rsquo; time.  Now is a good time to see what has been achieved.  It will not take me long because there has been nothing, not even an implementation plan.  As Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell said, the difficulty has been with cutbacks, which have affected all services but particularly neuro-rehabilitation and older people services.  In general, total community support hours have fallen, according to Age Action&rsquo;s figures, from &euro;11.97 million in 2009 to &euro;10.29 million last year, despite an increase in the number of people who wish to access the services.<\/p> <p>The Government rightly lauds the success of the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s national stroke programme in transforming acute stroke services across the country.  We have seen the death rate from the disease cut by 13%, against both demographic and international trends.  This means that more people than ever are returning home after a stroke but the community rehabilitation services that enable survivors to maximise their recovery and their quality of life are as bad as ever, however.  At the most vulnerable time of their lives, in the wake of a major brain injury, survivors are effectively abandoned at the hospital gates and left to face the future with no support or services.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The Irish Heart Foundation \"Cost of Stroke in Ireland\" research illustrates just how badly stroke survivors are being failed.  It should be underlined that the problem is not about how much money is being spent but where that money is being spent.

Of that &euro;557 million a year, &euro;414 million goes towards nursing home care and less than &euro;7 million goes on community rehabilitation.  How does this fit into Government policy to keep people at home?  We are saving more lives than ever from stroke due to improvements in hospital services and amazing staff.  The system then waits until after it can help maximise the recovery and after it can help people return to and remain in their homes before it spends any money on them, instead of switching the focus to rehabilitation.  We know that saves lives in instances of stroke, and saves the quality of life, which is core to the motion being put forward by Senator O'Donnell this evening.  <\/p><p>I would like the Government to look at the issue of early-supported discharge programmes, which Senator O'Donnell called a fair deal for home.  We need a way to ensure that we can care for people and that they can get the resources they need in their own homes.  The ESRI and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland report last year concluded that over 3,000 stroke survivors could benefit from early-supported discharge.  That would reduce hospital beds by 24,000 annually, freeing up vital space to ease the crisis.  The data from the three early-supported discharge pilot programmes in the Mater, Tallaght and Galway University hospitals indicate bed savings of between eight and 14 days per patient, along with improvements in self-reported quality of life, which is absolutely core to what we are talking about here from 9.5% to 19.4%.  Some people will say this is evidence from urban areas but, for example, Galway recorded the biggest bed day savings, even though the current programme only serves rural dwellers who make up to one third of its patient numbers.  <\/p><p>I support this motion because it is about the quality of all our lives.  If one looks at the UN principles for older people, one will see that they are about ensuring that people have the choices, that the services are there and that we do not needlessly put people into hospitals.  We have to ask what the roles of the hospital and the community services are.  I have experienced it with doctors on night call - all too often the easy option is to send a person to an accident and emergency department because the doctor is covered.  We need to drill down and have supports at home.  <\/p><p>My in-laws are Dutch and I see the amount of community support and the way the system is tailored around the home in the Netherlands.  If people need those supports in their home they will be there - people ask for them when they want them.  My father-in-law is quite ill and is able to ring and have a doctor within 20 minutes on every occasion.  We should be striving to have support in the home when it is needed and as it is needed.  We need to ensure that older people have access and the optimum level of physical, mental and emotional well-being.  We also need to look at the other services.  I have been discussing the medical services here this evening but there should also be educational, cultural, spiritual and recreational services.  I am sure we can debate this further.<\/p><p>I second this motion wholeheartedly.  This debate is part of a journey.  Senator O'Donnell has done considerable work on this area.  I hope this contributes to that debate but I really hope that it adds to action and a change in policy rather than platitudes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#SS00200","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I thank my colleagues for bringing forward this Private Members' motion.  We face a major challenge in this country over the next number of years to how we develop policy in this area.  Just because someone reaches a certain age does not mean that there is suddenly a dependency.  One lady who lives in my area is 99 years of age and still drives a car.  I have a connection with another person who is 91 years of age who is confined to a wheelchair and lives on her own.  She wants to live on her own because she does not want to go into a nursing home.  People can live on their own and can continue to live the life they want to live rather than being confined to a nursing home.  We need to examine how we do that and how to bring about the necessary changes to make sure more and more people can stay in their own homes and live there for a longer period of time.<\/p><p>It is interesting to read the vision statement &quot;Positive Ageing Starts Now&quot; which sets out quite clearly:<\/p><blockquote>Ireland will be a society for all ages that celebrates and prepares properly for individual and population ageing.  It will enable and support all ages and older people to enjoy physical and mental health and wellbeing to their full potential.  It will promote and respect older people's engagement in economic, social, cultural, community and family life, and foster better solidarity between generations.  It will be a society in which the equality, independence, participation, care, self-fulfilment and dignity of older people are pursued at all times.<\/blockquote> <p>It is a very important vision statement and we need to make sure that every word of that vision statement is followed through on.  I brought in a Private Members' Bill, the Health (Professional Home Care) Bill 2014, which set out quite clearly why we need to improve the monitoring of home care and to make sure that we plan for home care provision and that there is proper supervision and regulation of it.  The whole issue of home care is about making sure there is proper planning, risk assessment, a care plan, and that it deals with issues such as the handling of money, which older people worry about, manual handling, training, and the cost of that.  It is important to look at this.<\/p><p>The Law Reform Commission report set out that the guiding principles of the proposed legislative framework should be independent living, privacy and dignity, quality of care, and the protection of adults in receipt of professional home care.  It is important to develop a proper structure to provide home care for people who want to remain at home - that is the vast majority of people.  One of the things that has occurred over the last few years in the HSE is that a person who provided home care used to call two or three times a day for an hour each time, and suddenly that was cut back to half an hour.  It is inadequate to expect someone to travel to a person's house, when it takes 20 minutes to travel there and 20 minutes to go home, to get paid for half an hour.  We need to review that kind of approach and make sure that when people provide home care they are paid for an adequate period of time at the person's house so that they can actually properly look after the person.  <\/p><p>When we reviewed the structure there was a greater demand for home care so there was a certain budget.  It is a budget that needs to be increased over the next few years if we want to keep more and more people out of nursing homes.  If one looks at the figures, one will see that there are 585,000 people over the age of 65.  That will increase to 990,000 people between now and 2030.  We could immediately respond and say we need to create more nursing home beds but there is a cost factor there, whereas for every person who goes into a nursing home we can at least look after four or five people at home for the same cost of a nursing home bed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#TT00200","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#TT00300","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":269,"content":"<p>That is an important issue that needs to be looked at.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colm Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2353\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not in any way criticise what has occurred, but in fairness, in recent years we have more debates and discussions on the matter and many positive things have been done.  For example, we had the national positive ageing strategy, which was a plan for an ageing society from 2011 to 2016.  The strategy is now up for review.<\/p><p>Other plans include the healthy and positive ageing initiative and the Irish national dementia strategy.  Dementia is now a major challenge.  Approximately 50,000 people in this country have dementia.  The indications are that over the next 20 to 25 years the number will increase to well over 100,000 and we must plan for that as well.  The dementia strategy implementation programme has been drawn up and &euro;27.5 million has been made available for it.  That amount includes private funding of &euro;12 million, which is very helpful.  We do not have much time available and we must start to work now to increase the availability of home care services and home care packages.  We must ensure an adequate number of people are trained to provide home care.  We must also ensure an adequate number of training places are available.  There is a range of issues on which we need to work and we must follow through in that regard.  I thank those responsible for tabling this motion for discussion.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#TT00400","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I compliment Senators O&rsquo;Donnell and van Turnhout for their initiative in tabling the motion.  We are all great at talking in these debates and not so great at coming up with innovative solutions.  I agree with much of what Senator Burke said.  I am sure we will all agree with each other in the debate as there will be no contention.<\/p> <p>As my favourite Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is aware, the problem is that she is the one who is left with too few resources for her entire portfolio which encompasses mental health, ageing and the elderly.  Those are the people who are more vulnerable in society and their voice is not as loud as it ought to be.  When we have debates such as this, we all agree and tomorrow, unfortunately, it is a case of business as usual once again.<\/p> <p>We must push the boat out and think outside the box.  I suggested previously in the House that a pilot scheme could be set up whereby the means test for the carer&rsquo;s allowance would be abolished, with protocols to encourage the 12,000 people who do not need to be in care to go home with the assistance of an aunt, niece, first cousin, neighbour, brother or child.  The Minister of State should ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton, to consider that.  In addition to the support outlined and the provision of the carer&rsquo;s allowance of some hundreds of euro per week, those people should be given a medical card and, where necessary, a home care package to assist.  Protocols could be put in place to ensure that people are not just on the make in terms of becoming a carer for someone who does not need a carer.  No doubt there are enforcement measures and assessment criteria that would see through such applicants.<\/p> <p>The cost per week for district nursing homes run by the HSE in Sligo and Leitrim ranges from &euro;900 to &euro;1,550 and various sums in between.  It is not as simple as one being better at delivering the service than others; it is to do with the complexity of patients&rsquo; needs and the services that are provided.  If one takes away the carer&rsquo;s allowance, a number of home help hours, include the respite grant and a medical card, and take away the prescription charges, the per week charge would struggle to get to &euro;800 as opposed to sums ranging from &euro;900 to &euro;1,550 to keep a person in a nursing home.  I accept we are in an era where we are trying to reduce social welfare and we do not want social dependency but there is not an elderly person in a home in the country who does not have a relative capable of providing a level of support that might facilitate them in their home, who does not have a job and who would not be prepared to do this work.  A carer provides flexibility that a person in a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. job, five days a week, could not provide.  That would be something worth doing.  It could be done on a pilot basis, for example, in Sligo, or even for one nursing home or a group of nursing homes to see whether it would work, how much it costs and what could be saved.  Given all the factors involved, such an approach must be worth trying.  It is not the case that I am looking for any credit.<\/p> <p>I would welcome a response from the Minister of State on the issue, not today, but after she speaks to her officials, the Department of Social Protection, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste to see whether we could try such an approach.  Perhaps we could get all parties to put it into their manifestos in advance of the election whether that is in February, March or whenever.  It could be a real winner, not for votes but for older people.  The votes would undoubtedly come but that is not the point.<\/p> <p>None of us has covered ourselves in glory in recent Administrations.  When the money was available we had one-upmanship and pensions and supports increased.  It was never enough.  When it came to cutting back there was too much of a focus on taking the money back.  It was easy to do that and people just had to accept it.<\/p> <p>I do not wish to be overly political but let us consider the savings made on prescription charges.  Before the election the charges were to be abolished.  The then Opposition spokesman on health, Deputy James Reilly, was most vociferous on the almost criminal aspect of the charge.  It is difficult to disagree with that perspective.  Then the charge was increased from 50 cent to &euro;2.50.  One could ask how much we collected.  I suspect it was a negligible amount.<\/p> <p>The same is true of the changes to the criteria for medical cards for those aged over 70.  There were other small changes such as to the telephone allowance and the respite grant.  We all welcome the return of the latter, as it was a key support to the 77,000 families that are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Carers save the Government of the day &euro;4 billion a year in terms of the care they provide.  What divides me politically from perhaps the Minister for Social Protection or the Minister for Finance in recent years is that people who were earning more than &euro;100,000 a year were expected to be hit by another 1% or 2% in the more difficult budgets of recent years.  They would not have liked it, nor would they have wanted it and it would not have got anybody any votes but they were better heeled to sustain the hit rather than the few hundred million euro that was saved or gathered as a result of increases in such measures as the prescription charge increase or the cut to the bereavement grant, changes in criteria for the medical card and the drug payment scheme increasing from &euro;120 to &euro;144.  They made a significant difference to people&rsquo;s lives.  As someone with a mortgage and everything else who has faced up to the recession as best I can, if asked whether I would have been prepared to pay a little bit more for the relative security of those older people, I think I would.  I urge the Minister of State to please look at that as a possibility.  By all means, she can come back and tell me I am crazy and why, but I think it is worth a try.  Let us hope there is never a recession like this again, but if there is, next time I hope we can focus on taking that little bit more from the people better placed to sustain it, even though they will not like it.<\/p> <p>There is a nursing crisis in this country that is caused by a number of different reasons.  First, we are training one third fewer nurses per year since 2008.  That is bearing out now.  I read a press release from the INMO today which outlined that the number of nurses at the beginning of 2008 was 39,000 while today there are 34,200.  There are approximately 4,800 fewer nurses in the system.  Inevitably, that takes its toll on things such as home help.  An aggressive recruitment policy is not paying off, largely because pay and conditions are being judged as insufficient by graduates themselves who want to go elsewhere.  There is also competition from private nursing homes.  That is another area on which the Minister of State must focus.<\/p> <p>I have tried to be innovative and come up with suggestions.  I hope the Minister of State can try to take them on board and come up with a response.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marc MacSharry:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2010\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2010&amp;amp;pid=MarcMacSharry&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I commend the Minister of State on her commitment to her job but I condemn the lack of foresight on the part of her colleagues in government to provide her with the resources she needs to look after the most vulnerable in society in terms of those with mental health issues and the elderly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#UU00200","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

Others think the accumulated benefits of aging, such as knowledge, experience and wisdom, mean it is not a burden but something that is welcome and necessary.  As a society, as people and as policy makers, we must acknowledge our attitudes to aging and see where the fit into the dichotomy of views on aging.  This takes on an increasing importance as our population ages.  It is unhelpful to think of elderly people as a homogenous group.  I know a man in Glanmire named Joe who celebrated his 90th birthday on Saturday night last.  He still cuts grass using his ride-on mower.  As a psychiatric nurse, I have spent a long time looking after elderly people and those who suffer with mental health issues.  There are people in their early 60s who do not enjoy the benefits of good health.  It is important, therefore, that we do not lump everyone together in a homogenous group and state that all of those who are elderly have the same needs.<\/p> <p>There is no family in the country that does not experience the joy of living with a parent or a relative who is becoming increasingly elderly.  In parallel to the aging process comes the decline in people's health, etc.  It is important that we put the needs of elderly people at the top of our policy agenda.  There has been a recent move in that direction.  We see it in the Bill that was debated last week in the D&aacute;il on increasing the age of retirement.  The Minister of State has also placed the fair deal scheme at the top of the political agenda.  She has made great moves in terms of delivering in this area and that fact must be acknowledged.<\/p> <p>Many families, including my own, have required the assistance of the State.  An elderly, widowed relative of mine was happily living alone until we started noticing some declines in her health.  For example, she would forget to eat her dinner some days.  In hindsight, these were signs of the onset of Alzheimer's disease.  They were not recognised, of course, although one would think I, as a psychiatric nurse, would have been able to spot them.  However, the onset of the disease can be insidious and slow and it can go unnoticed.  The onset of the disease required that pathway of care for my relative be put in place.  It is interesting that it was generally a good experience for us.  The main initial concern of my elderly relative was terrible because it was loneliness.  It was not a specific illness or disability but loneliness is debilitating.  I know the Minister of State understands this point.<\/p> <p>This relative came to live with us but we needed support.  The voluntary sector offers fantastic support in this regard.  The services offered by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the Carers Association are fantastic if, unfortunately, limited given the demands on their time and resources.  We used the private sector extensively.  I will mention one group called Home Instead.  The service offered was wonderful and affordable because, although a private organisation, tax reliefs were available.  This relative only had her pension but she could afford 20 hours a week of someone from Home Instead coming and sitting with her, minding her and chatting with her.  At the end of the year, marginal rate tax relief was available which set us up nicely for the following year.  We should consider extending the tax relief on such schemes or we should find some other mechanism.  We were lucky that we could afford to do it.  A large number of people cannot afford it, which is unfair.  Is there some way it could be extended, be it by means of the tax system or otherwise?  I am not saying we should replace the statutory and voluntary bodies but we should allow the private sector to complement what is being done.  In doing so, we would relieve some of the burdens placed on the State's resources.<\/p> <p>We had a negative experience when my elderly relative had to go to hospital.  She fell one night and injured her shoulder.  We had a very poor experience at the accident and emergency department.  The accident and emergency services are always topical, but the service was very unsatisfactory.  Once she was in the system, however, the service was fantastic.  Access to the system was the problem.  After she was patched up and came home, she was grand and decided, in consultation with us, that her needs would be best met in a nursing home.  We applied for the fair deal scheme and got a place in a short space of time.  It was a place here in Dublin which I will mention because I was so impressed with the level of care.  It is called Kiltipper Woods and is located beyond Rathfarnham.  The level of care was fantastic.  I tell this story by way of illustrating the way the private and public sectors can complement each other.  We should be looking at all opportunities to see what we can do to join seamlessly the public, private and voluntary sectors.  There is huge scope.  The Minister is active in this area herself and it is something she is sympathetic towards, for which I commend her, but it is such a difficulty for people facing the challenge of finding the best care for elderly relatives.  Of course, we should not speak passively of the elderly because they have to be participants and partners in their care.  <\/p> <p>This is a really good motion which allows us a good opportunity to express many views.

The one thing the elderly need and demand from the political system is a sense of security and safety.  They demand a safety net.  They want to know that they will be okay and that if they get sick they will be looked after.

At the end of their lives they hope this will be remembered and recognised and that practical support and actions flowing from the words of politicians will be available or carried out for their benefit.<\/p><p>Various issues affecting the elderly have been rehearsed in the debate.  Like all Members, I speak to elderly people all the time.  They tend to know the politicians in their constituency, much more so than young people.  Perhaps that is due to a familiarity built up over many years, although some are very much part of a political tradition.  Among the measures they point to as having a particularly harsh effect on their lives and lifestyles is the prescription charge.  Senator Marc MacSharry said there was a promise to abolish it prior to the previous general election, but he is wrong.  The then Fine Gael spokesperson on health, Deputy James Reilly, now Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, committed to abolishing it once he took office in March or April 2011.  That gave false hope because it was not an election promise; it was, presumably, a commitment flowing from the programme for Government.  Not only did he fail to abolish it but the charge has escalated.  If this teaches us one thing, it is that whenever a charge or tax is brought in, it only goes one way.  Taxes never reduce or disappear.  A harsh lesson has been learned in that regard.  A charge of 50 cent was applied with the best of intentions and with the support of many people to ensure medicines would be used for the purpose for which they had been provided and to ensure they would not be provided unnecessarily, but this sensible arrangement has simply morphed into a tax that is having an impact on the elderly who would love to have seen movement on this issue in the budget.<\/p><p>Another issue the elderly raise regularly is the loss of the telephone allowance, which has been much more than a financial loss.  They had the security of knowing that they could stay in contact with their relatives, friends and the Garda, if necessary, but they now face the additional costs associated with having a monitoring device, which are considerable.  This affects the security of the elderly and it is incumbent on us all to work to have the allowance restored.  <\/p><p>While I appreciate that the Minister of State's Department is not responsible, I have received a number of complaints about the new system for monitoring alarms.  The community groups that provide and supervise the systems for the elderly state Pobal is requiring them to do a great deal of work that ordinarily would have been done by public servants.  The organisation is putting a great deal of bureaucracy in their way to maintain these community alert systems.  This is scaring many of the groups involved and I hope it will not have a negative effect on the provision of such systems.  Many groups were happy dealing with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government because they knew the officials involved.  There was significant upset a few years ago when the telephone allowance was cut, on which there were various political debates.  Generally, officials in that Department were helpful to community groups that administered these schemes.  However, the changeover to Pobal has not gone smoothly, according some of those to whom I have spoken.  Some changes are necessary, but the process of change needs to be explained better and improvements need to be made to bring the community groups along.  This issue has been raised by genuine people who assist the elderly in the provision of monitored alarm systems.  Many of them give of their time voluntarily to organise the schemes and often they are elderly themselves.  More power to them that they are doing this.<\/p><p>If there was movement on the telephone allowance and the prescription charge, it would give a deeper sense of security to the elderly who need to feel secure.  Respect for one's elders in an ancient tradition in this country.  The extended families of fad&oacute;, with the elderly granny sitting in the corner being looked after, are no longer as prevalent and care homes tend to look after more of the elderly.  That derives from our own traditions, while all of the practical actions derive from UN principles for older persons, of which previous speakers have, thankfully, reminded us.  <\/p><p>I thank those who tabled the motion.  I do not suppose anybody will vote against it.  We all support it, but it is a question of how we put it into practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#VV01100","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I compliment Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell on tabling the motion which was seconded by Senator Jillian van Turnhout.  It is apt at this time.  The proportion of over 65s increased by 21% between 2006 and 2013 and the number in this age group is projected to increase by approximately 20,000 each year in the next few years, rising to between 850,000 and 860,000 by 2021.  The proportion of over 80s is set to increase even more dramatically.  The Government has initiated a number of proposals and initiatives, including the national positive ageing strategy 2011 to 2016.  The programme for Government committed to implementing the strategy in order that older people would be recognised, supported and enabled to live independent, full lives, which is the key point.  The elderly population should be allowed to live in their own environment for as long as they can and all Governments should assist in every way possible to ensure they have the comfort and security of their own home, with the necessary supports to facilitate this.  It is much cheaper to do what the people themselves want, which is to stay in their homes, with the necessary supports provided, rather than putting them in nursing homes under the fair deal scheme at a cost to the State of more than &euro;1,000 a week.  The scheme is an absolute necessity, as many people cannot live on their own and need the service, but others would love be in their own home, with the support of family or community and voluntary services.  That is what we should aim to do in order that we help in any way possible.<\/p> <p>Not so long ago the Minister of State visited a supportive care home in my city.  The Holy Ghost residential home caters for 60 residents who do not require full-time medical and nursing care.  They are provided with meals, entertainment and medicine, but they are ambulant.  However, without this service, they would be availing of the fair deal scheme at a cost to the State of more than &euro;1,000 a week.  This care home which provides these facilities through charitable work, investments and so on receives &euro;50 a week for each resident.  This cannot and will not continue.  The home will close eventually, unless it receives adequate State support in the interests of the elderly people concerned.  The Minister of State has seen at first hand the work being done in the home.  There are a number of other supportive care homes in the south east, in particular, which require support and they would save the State significant moneys in the process.  <\/p> <p>As well as supporting the elderly, we must think of ways to save money.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maurice Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, money is not being saved by giving this group &euro;50 per week to support elderly people while others are getting &euro;1,000, albeit obviously for the increased nursing care and so on which one would get in a nursing home.  This is not a nursing home; it is a supportive care home.  While I do not often support Senator Byrne when he speaks in the House, I support his comments on the monitoring alarms and so on.  They are crucial to people living alone in particular.  My own mother had one and it was essential.  These devices are a source of support for elderly people and give them a bit of confidence.  If, as the Senator states, red tape is now preventing people from getting these alarms in a timely fashion, it should be eliminated.  As I stated, they are a source of support for elderly people.<\/p><p>This House formed the Public Consultation Committee at the behest of the independent Taoiseach's nominees.  One of the committee's first reports was on the elderly and it made a number of recommendations, many of which have been attended to, while others need to be.  However, Members should not forget it was the committee's first report.  It was initiated in this House and it is right and fitting that Senator O'Donnell has followed up on that report and that Members should review it, as well as the entire system of supports for elderly people, because it will not be too long before they are in that state themselves.  Consequently, one must look after the elderly as best as one possibly can, as one is judged by how one can support elderly people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#WW00400","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#XX00200","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":287,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is doing and has been doing everything possible, particularly during the first three years of this Government's term in office, when the cupboard was bare and there was not a penny to spend.

Many local post offices have closed and telephone allowances have been cut.  The giant supermarkets have closed many corner shops, thus culling the vital lines of human communications and friendships our elders love and need.  I need not remind Members that loneliness is the greatest dread that cloaks older people.

It is an alternative to institutional residential care for older persons and a model that creates a society for all ages.  This development is within walking distance, not for an able-bodied individual but for a person with arthritis, bronchitis, angina or similar, of shops, services and public transport.  It has on-site intergenerational facilities and emphasises what people can do rather than what they cannot do.  It is about wellness rather than illness and 12 years after first being envisaged, McAuley Place, located in the former Mercy convent in the heart of Naas, consists of 53 apartments.  I love its website and ask all Members to have a look at it.  Indeed, they should all book in because Senator O'Donnell should note rent is only &euro;85 per week with a service charge of &euro;10 per week and tenants pay for their own electricity.  It is about living an independent life but as part of a community.  It is about being the boss of one's own life, having access to the arts and opportunities for lifelong learning.  It is about living where one's age is not an issue.  It is about where one is more aware of what one can do as opposed to what one cannot do.  Residents have opportunities to volunteer, to make new friends and to maintain old friendships.  They have easy access to shops and services and live 130 paces from a bus stop that gives one access to Dublin Airport and, therefore, to the entire world.  Living there entails being challenged to go outside one's comfort zone and is about ensuring one can maintain or regain the optimal level of well-being.  It is great not to need a car.  It is about having enough stress to keep one challenged but taking away that stupid stress of being obliged to manage alone.  Incidentally, speaking of stress for a moment, I could talk for hours with Senator O'Donnell on the subject but I have three people who are over 90 and to be honest, it is a stressful situation.  As for somewhere like the McAuley centre, I sometimes think it would be great to be able to free up the three-bedroom houses for families.  Older people could move in to be safer and in a collective and Senator O'Donnell and I could discuss the property tax and how we access it online to pay it because we have not a clue without help.  It is about having choices about what one does every day and having the expectation of the unexpected.  It is about being proud of where one lives.  While it is not a home, it is home.  A wonderful concert will be held there this evening which I would attend, were I not present in the Chamber.  A total of 17 musicians have been gathered and everyone in the town of Naas will attend; it is not just for the elder people.  One might think that is all very well for older able-bodied people but I ask the Minister of State to visit that centre with the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar.  It is a piece of low-hanging fruit in that with planning and not too much cost, villages like that could be built throughout Ireland and the Minister of State and I could book in for later on.  Believe it or not, this evening's debate is about planning for our future.<\/p> <p>However, what about those who must enter nursing homes?  Again, I have one such person who is in a nursing home.  Luckily, my own experience is wonderful and I cannot express my admiration and awe for the carers I have encountered.  However, Members must envisage nursing homes that provide much more than a television set on a wall.  Nursing homes are needed that have sensory rooms and a screen showing lovely movies from the years when the guests themselves were young, to allow them to reminisce.  Nursing homes are needed in which animal lovers are able to pet a lovely carefree dog.  As Senator O'Donnell is aware, I adore dogs and bring two dogs into the nursing home every Saturday and for old people with serious dementia in particular, my blessed dogs give pleasure.  The dogs do not care what age one is or what one looks like.  They will sit on people's laps and stare at them adoringly.  It is amazing what a care dog can do.  Young actors, there are enough of them around, could read aloud to residents and teenagers should come in to perform classical dance.  Personal instructors should come in to teach chair yoga, that is, gentle exercises and meditation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Ann O'Brien:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2389\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2389&amp;amp;pid=MaryAnnOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In some nursing homes, daytime television is the order of the day but daytime television is a way to disimprove one's mental health.  <\/p><p>I have so much to say but my final word will be on practicalities.

We all agree that this is not a debate about charity but a debate about our obligation as a people to those who built up our country, worked, paid their taxes and reared their families.  Sometimes the wrong perception goes out because at times we seem not to value the worth of people because they have reached a certain age.  It is quite easy in a debate like this to advance a set of statistics to prove or disprove a particular point.  I would not want, in any way, to say we cannot give consideration to those statistics, which are important, but there is an attitude of mind that must be considered.  Very often that attitude of mind permeates a lot of our discussion and communications.  At times we think only of younger people, how they must be served and provided for, and rightly so.  It is also important to have equality because we talk about equality in a democracy.<\/p> <p>I do not know how many Members have had the opportunity of visiting a community daycare centre.  I strongly recommend everyone should do so, particularly in rural Ireland.  I can think of one centre that I visited in Kilmalley in County Clare which is a model in every sense of the word.  There are many messages to be learned from the centre.  The people who go there once a week spend the whole week in anticipation because they love it so much.  When they go to the centre, they meet their neighbours, they reminisce and they encourage each other.  The ladies can get their hair done and everyone has lunch there.  All of that is part of the service provided.  The message that I have learned is that when one has the right model and the right personnel in charge of any project relating to older people, then it will work.<\/p> <p>Some Members will have had what I would regard as a very distressing experience of seeing an older person being brought to a nursing home.  There are times when one cannot do anything about that but there are many occasions when it happens simply because parts of the structure that would enable people to remain at home and mobile are missing.  I urge Members to always try to remember that the old person who has been placed in a nursing home feels deserted and that nobody loves or cares for them anymore.  We must keep that in mind.  I know cases where people get just one hour of home help during the day which is sufficient to keep them at home.  It gives them a sense of independence, a sense of worth and the respect, to which they are entitled.  As I said, we could all advance statistics but I am not going to do so in this particular case.  However, I will say that increasing home help from one hour to two hours could make all the difference.  We are not talking about hundreds of cases but about thousands.  When a loved one wants to look after a parent and his or her home needs to be adapted, the pace at which the decision is made is important.  If it takes too long to reach a decision, then the operation may fall apart entirely.  As a result, the adaptation will not take place and the parent will end up in a nursing home.<\/p> <p>We must admit that family structures have changed and are not what they were and people are out working.  We must be cognisant of all of those types of issues.  We are not going to be able to set the clock back but we need to move a little faster in our understanding that in the same way as communication has changed.  For example, there is now social media and many old people are outside of such technology.  I have even heard of old people who were able to drive a car but when roundabouts came into existence, they would no longer drive their car.  That is how simple a change in lifestyle can affect older people.  We often make those changes for the better but in most cases, without considering the impact that remains behind.<\/p> <p>The media can also play a role.  We often hear of great achievements by people being presented in the media.  However, they are achievements that do not always press a button or set off the lights.  I refer to the achievements of older people in their communities which I have seen in various committees and organisations.  The organisations also play an important role.  The GAA, Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, the Irish Country Women's Association and farmers, etc. are the bodies that keep in contact with the older people.  I always recall the time when President Mary McAleese appealed to organisations to look out for older people.  I heard the comment made by Senator O'Donnell earlier and agree with her 100% that if one leaves an animal unattended for a few days at home, one is likely to have an official visit.  Very often we do not look out for older people in the same way.  There was the dreadful case in Tipperary, which was published in the newspapers recently and which was absolutely mind-boggling.  We need to look out for older people and bring back the community spirit that existed in the past.  I urge people to look out for people when the weather is not good, etc.<\/p> <p>I said I would not quote statistics as I do not think this is the time for political point scoring.  In terms of what has to be achieved, I wonder in what way will what we have said here inform change and a response to the problems which exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#YY00400","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":297,"content":"<p>The Senator is well over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#YY00500","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I hope that this is just the first debate that we will have here.

I also compliment Senators O'Donnell and van Turnhout for tabling the motion.  We are all on the side of the elderly but will there be any action after all of this talk?  I have worked with older people and know that we have made some good strides but a lot more needs to be done.  I will outline one of the improvement that have been made.  This time last year in order to qualify for the fair deal scheme, one had to wait between 14 and 16 weeks and pay upfront but now the wait is only two weeks.  That is a massive improvement in waiting times, which is welcome.<\/p> <p>However, there has been enough investment in home care packages and in the home help service.  I know from talking to home helps, a fact which I have said over the past couple of years, in my county one is not talking about home help hours any more but home help minutes.  Home helps have been asked to go into houses for 15 minutes to do whatever they can but that is nothing.  Massive improvements need to take place there.  More investment in home care packages and home helps will also save on the fair deal scheme.<\/p> <p>An issue I raised in the Seanad some weeks ago is that there is no joined up thinking between Departments.  Each Department has a budget and Departments do not talk to each other.  For instance, I know a lady in my county who suffered a stroke some months ago.  She is now in a bed in Galway, which costs the State &euro;100,000 a year.  All she wants is a grant from the local authority to adapt her home and make it suitable for her to leave her bed and be looked after by her family.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Kelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2348\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2348&amp;amp;pid=JohnKelly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The grant would be &euro;35,000 but because she is a little bit over the limit, she does not qualify for it.  If there was joined-up thinking between Departments, the Minister for Health would say to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government that they could save &euro;65,000 by just giving this woman the grant.  The money is all coming out of the same pocket.  <\/p><p>As has been said by other speakers, we all know elderly people who do not want to go to a nursing home.  They want to be cared for at home.  Michael Lambert, who was the oldest man in Ireland and who died last year at the age of 107, was a neighbour of mine.  He never spent a day in a nursing home and was in great health up to his death.  We should be doing more for the day care centres mentioned by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  I visit the day care centre in my own town on a regular basis.  It is a big part of keeping somebody in their home.  It is vital for their sanity.  I also visit the psychiatric day care centre.  For some unknown reason, the psychiatric services in the past couple of years have all been about saving money.  I got a call from two psychiatric patients who attend the day care centre in Ballaghaderreen.  They were frightened by the threat of the bus service being withdrawn.  Even though clinical decisions had been made by the chief psychiatrist that they should attend the day care centre in Ballaghaderreen rather than one in Castlerea, somebody in administration decided it cost too much and is threatening to remove it.  We talk a lot about what we should be doing but we are not actually doing a lot about it.  <\/p><p>My last point concerns how farmers are assessed for the fair deal scheme.  There is a difference between the farmer I know in rural Ireland and the rancher in County Meath.  Farmers have small farms that are not worth a lot.  I do not think their farms should be assessed against them as a business once they go into a nursing home.  A smart farmer who can think ahead and is clever enough to transfer his land to somebody else in excess of five years previously is fine because his land is not assessed against him when he goes into a nursing home.  If somebody does not think ahead about the day they might have to go into a nursing home, and I know that the IFA is thinking about this issue, and their land is assessed against them when they go in for the duration of their stay there, it could mean that they could lose the entire farm.  These people could be bachelors or they could have family.  They might want to keep the farm in the family name.  If somebody had transferred their property to somebody else four and a half years ago and they need to go into a nursing home today, one would think that in six months time when the five-year period is up, the land will no longer be assessable but no, if the five-year period is not up, it is assessable for the duration of their stay in a nursing home.  I urge the Minister of State to look at the plight of farmers in respect of this issue.  If the farm was assessed on the same basis as the house for a three-year period, that would be very acceptable to all concerned.  <\/p><p>I totally agree with some of Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's remarks about elderly people or anybody trying to access services on the telephone and being told to dial one for this and two and three for the other.  I made one such telephone call today and eventually gave up.  I suggest that there be dedicated telephone lines for elderly people relating to the services they need.  It can be clear that if one gives the Department of Social Protection one's PPS number, it knows what age you are.  There should be dedicated telephone lines for people over the age of 66 where it is vital that somebody answers the telephone because what elderly people have to go through is a nonsense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#YY00700","speaker":"1161","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and the motion.

I was surprised to learn that we actually had ratified the 1999 UN convention because we are certainly not complying with it and I am not even sure what efforts we are making to comply with it.  Are we doing anything?  Have we done anything over the past ten, 15 or 20 years to assist our elderly people to reside at home as long as possible?  Absolutely not.  Have we improved health care provision notwithstanding the economic meltdown?  Absolutely not.  What sort of provision is there for elderly people in cultural or educational services?  It is minimalist.  We have gone backwards rather than forwards.<\/p> <p>Last week, the budget was well re-played in this House and elsewhere.  The debate about the elderly in the budget revolved around the fair deal scheme - the nursing home subvention as I call it.  There was a modest but welcome increase in old age pensions.  However, if one asked elderly people throughout this country what the services and aspirations they were hoping for - not from a one-day budget but from Government - they would talk about security in their homes, certainty of health care and trying to remain in their homes as long as possible.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State is doing her best to try make progress on the fair deal scheme.  I raised the very lengthy waiting period for assessment many months ago in this House, as did my colleagues.  We have become obsessed with this scheme as being somehow a solution to elderly care and we see the nursing home, the decent nursing home bed and decent nursing home provision as meeting the aspirations of the elderly.  We must recognise that the vast majority of elderly people in this country do not want to be in nursing homes.  They want to be at home with their families and communities.  We have completely failed to respond to that aspiration.  <\/p> <p>Senator Kelly gave the figures about the individual case in Galway and we can all talk about such cases.  We can all talk about cases where because of our very narrow definition of means for carer's allowance, we are refusing carer's allowance payments to family members and neighbours which would cost the State a maximum of &euro;10,000 per annum.  In many cases, those people who fail to get the assistance of a carer's allowance end up in residential care costing the State a multiplicity of those figures.  Due to the economic meltdown, our changes to the public health nurse scheme and the home help scheme have resulted in people seeking long-term residential care rather than care in the community.<\/p> <p>Our focus is wrong.  We receive on a monthly basis lobbying calls or letters from the nursing home organisations.  Of course, I would lobby if I was them because it is a profitable venture.  This is not charity.  It is a cold and clinical business.  Insofar as the State can respond, we are responding to that business - perhaps not as sufficiently as they would wish - but we are not responding to the much broader issue of attempting to allow people to remain at home.  I know that in the Minister of State's response, the Minister's response and the response of all politicians, we will claim that we aspire to allowing people to remain at home but we are failing to do so.  Senator Kelly, as a former community welfare officer and former member of the council, and I can remind the Minister of State that there was a time when the very basic disabled person's grant scheme processed locally resulted in a modest grant of &euro;1,500, &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 being paid to somebody to permit a minor improvement to their house from an accessibility perspective to allow them to stay at home.  Now there is no point in approaching the council seeking a grant of &euro;1,500.  The job needs to cost &euro;15,000 or &euro;30,000 before the council will even consider it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Bradford:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=73\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=73&amp;amp;pid=PaulBradford&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We really have lost the run of ourselves and common sense has gone out the door.  The schemes which existed and worked well, such as the home help, the disabled person&rsquo;s grant and the carer&rsquo;s allowance in its early days, were real solutions.  We must go back to those practical solutions because they worked.  No matter what progress the Minister of State makes with the fair deal scheme, there are all sorts of anomalies, a fact highlighted by Senator John Kelly.  Even if we remove the assessment waiting lists, it will not solve the problem of those who want to stay at home.  It must be a question of focusing on community, changing the carer&rsquo;s allowance, providing sufficient home-help packages, freeing up the old disabled person&rsquo;s grant and making them work.<\/p><p>I commend the Senators on moving this motion and causing us to reflect on this issue once again.  We are failing the elderly.  This country is facing a pensions crisis, along with an entirely new set of demographic problems.  If we think progressing the fair deal scheme is the answer to it, we are sadly mistaken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#ZZ00500","speaker":"1205","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell started off on a high note.  I was fascinated by her description of those who have reached a certain point in their lives when they could dispense with wisdom.  That is the type of later life experience I want and she wants too.  Thankfully, there are still some people with some bit of joy in their hearts.<\/p> <p>Having listened to the most recent speakers, however, I must admit I am not certain I want to get to that stage in life at all.  If that is what people see as what it will be like in later life, it is quite worrying.  We must deal in facts.  Of course, when one looks to the future, one has to have aspirations.  Facts are important as well, however.  For example, there are 575,000 people over 65 in this country.  Of those, 4%, 23,000 people, are in nursing homes.  Up to 50,000 of them are in receipt of home help.  It might not be 24-hour care but they are in receipt of it.  Up to 13,600 people are in receipt of home-care packages, which is an enhanced home-care provision.  Every time I talk about psychiatric units, psychiatrists tell me we are not there yet.  I am never certain where there is.  I am never certain that when we get there, should we be there at all.  Surely, it will change and we should be open to change.  Members know the majority of older people lead happy and fulfilled lives.<\/p> <p>I have said many times that I am charged on three different fronts.  In the context of mental health, I am charged with closing down big institutions and bringing people out of them.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is involved in one area with me in this.  When it comes to disabilities, I am also charged with ensuring people come out of institutions.  However, when I addressed a conference on nursing homes, I made it clear that it would appear to me that I am charged with putting older people into nursing homes.  I have no intention of doing that.  Later life is about much more than dependency and so forth.  We now have a single assessment tool which means it is quite difficult to qualify for the fair deal scheme to go into long-stay care.  The evidence of that is that people used to live for three years in a nursing home setting.  Now, they are living for half of that time and it tends to be more for end-of-life, high-dependency care.  That is a good development.<\/p> <p>I know I do not want to end my days in a nursing home.  I most definitely do not want to end my days in a single room at the end of a corridor that lives up to HIQA standards.  I want to live in circumstances that are appropriate to my needs.  I am concerned the focus of this discussion is that it will all end in tears and we are all doomed.  It is about more than that and we should aspire to more than that.<\/p> <p>When I am calling for more resources to be put into this sector, we need to stop talking about age.  Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell gave the example of 99 year olds living independently, perfectly happy and with no supports.  However, there are 40 year olds who need home help.  It should be more about needs rather than age.  That would change our vision.  What would I do if I were a member of a new Government starting out and could determine what would happen in this area?  I believe we should have a new ministry for primary and social care, separate and independent from health.  If one looks at the list of what Members said older people need, I have very little responsibility for many of things included on it.  The telephone allowance, safety at home, alarms, carer&rsquo;s allowance, prescription charges, all have nothing to do with me.  These are all delivered by other Departments in a different way and with a different focus.  Accordingly, how can one have can have joined-up thinking, as Senator Paul Bradford demanded?  Surely, it could be done if there was one Department with responsibility.  We must start to think how we can do this better.  The housing adaptation grants are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  If I told the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government that the &euro;22 million for the grant should be my responsibility, I can imagine the answer I would get.  We must have a more co-ordinated, more cohesive and more visionary approach to dealing with our aging population.<\/p> <p>For the past four years, the Government has been doing its very best to ensure the country did not go down the tubes.  It was about maintaining the services as they were.  We have a little more flexibility now, which is why we are putting more money into home helps and home-care packages.  We should not assume, however, that we know what is best for other people.  Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien spoke about how she wants to be able to make decisions for herself when she reaches 85 years of age.

At least we are thinking about this.  God knows we did not do that in the past.  I agree we need to change our focus and we need to ensure that when people make a choice and outline their will and preference, we are able to support that.  However, I am nervous that we would assume what people want.  Some people will want the security of a nursing home and long-stay care and others will not.  It is not what I would choose but we should ensure they are facilitated.  I congratulate the Senator for tabling the motion.  The debate is important and it is also important that we were open enough to have it because, at the end of the day, we are discussing our future and we should not assume that those who are described as &quot;older people&quot; are somehow some kind of alien species and the rest of us will not reach that stage when we know that with great good fortune we will.  I read <i>Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End<\/i>and I agree entirely with the opening sentence.  Every morning one steps out of bed, it is a roll of dice as to whether one will make it back there safely that night.

I am not surprised that more colleagues are absent.  I do not mean this is an accusatory way but this is a profound issue and it will be the major issue of the decade.  It is more profound than water charges or arguing about, or because of, territory.  I know Margharita Solon who imagined and developed the McAuley centre in Naas, County Kildare.  I read all her work and I spent time there during the year.  When I spoke to her about older people, she said, \"Who are you talking about?\"  I replied, \"Well, the older people who live here.\"  She asked, \"What do you think you are?\", and pointed out that they are human beings.  I take the Minister of State's point in this regard.  She referred to agelessness.  We will all get old but that is life.  I asked Ms Solon what the residents did when they needed a doctor.  She said, \"What do you do when you need a doctor?  You ring a doctor.\"  She was also interesting on cultural change and isolation, whether one is young, middle aged, old, married, single or whatever.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for taking the motion and for standing up to much of my contribution because she is right.  However, there does not have to be neglect or institutionalisation.  We should put more imagination and creativity into caring for people at home and use templates from around the country, including the brilliant ones in Cork, that are working well.  It does not always have to be one way.  That is what I was talking about.<\/p> <p>I was a member of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, as was Senator van Turnhout, who seconded the motion.  It was amazing.  It was the first time that I realised that old people get depressed.  That issue was highlighted in results produced by the Centre for Ageing in TCD.  One thinks of loneliness but older people do not talk about their depression in the same way.  It seems to be the preserve of a younger cohort.  The Proclamation states that no one who serves the cause of the Republic \"will dishonour it by cowardice, inhumanity...\".  I was arguing the case for humanity, as was the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>The problem about being old is that people are never old, they are always young.  We think of them as old.  I oppose the fact that 80% of nursing homes are stand-alone businesses.  The business template takes over and the residents are secondary to that.  The homes have to look into the way they operate.<\/p> <p>In response to Senator MacSharry, the Government should examine the possibility of providing the fair deal scheme within the home.  It might work because the participants could perhaps hand over a higher percentage of the value of their home when they die.  We do not pass on; we die.  That is another myth.<\/p> <p>Some Nordic countries have an adoption process for older people.  I like that extraordinary idea.  It works because many couples and individuals are lonely and they would be happy to have somebody to look after.  They might not have had the privilege of parents or grandparents and they might love to adopt an older person.  There are also cr&egrave;ches within nursing homes in these countries, which is a wonderful idea.<\/p> <p>The issue is not money.  We need to be creative and imaginative with our nursing home structure because we need nursing homes.  I have met the most extraordinary people in care in nursing homes and caring for older people in them through my work outside the House.  The arts, music and culture can be used imaginatively in these homes.<\/p> <p>I do not want to end my days in a nursing home and neither does the Minister of State.  If I was to write a paper as to why, or if she was to talk to me outside about this following the debate, we would outline what is wrong with them.  By that, I mean when they do not work for the person and they work according to the business template.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State made a good point about a Ministry for primary and social care.  She made a massive case for it and she would be good as Minister.  If I was in her position with her knowledge built up over the past four years, I might use that platform in the next election.  She has been an amazingly communicative Minister and it would be interesting to marry the different responsibilities of Departments for older people into one central Department.  They do not talk to each other and they affect people's lives through delays and so on.  It is a good platform and the Minister of State should use it, given her knowledge.  There is nobody better than her to bring this about.<\/p> <p>I thank her for taking the motion.  I will return to this issue.  It is not going away because our lives are not going away.  Time and tide stops for no man.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#BBB00200","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445419800,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445419800,"counter":312,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#BBB00400","nonspeaker":"Acting Chairman (Senator van Turnhout)"},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":313,"content":"<p>At 10.30 tomorrow morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102100002#BBB00500","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445419800,"counter":314,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 7.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 22 October 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
