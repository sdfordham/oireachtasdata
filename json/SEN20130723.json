Reports of horse trading have made it into the public domain.  Fine Gael is happy to cut child benefit and the Labour Minister, Deputy Burton, is reluctant to do so.  On this occasion we might consider adding to the burden of those best placed to take it, those on incomes over &euro;100,000.  There were Labour, Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il proposals to do that in last year's budget preparations rather than hitting the most vulnerable, such as those with a disability or in receipt of mobility grants or child care payments, which are needed for regular life payments.  With households feeling the pinch, people are spending up to &euro;67 less per week on groceries for their homes.  We must make sure that, in preparing the budget, those best placed to meet the burden are those we ask to do so.  Child benefit is not the correct place to start.<\/p><p>I welcome that Permanent TSB is making offers to people on split mortgages.  It is many years since we started talking about this and calling for it to happen in a meaningful way.  Some evidence indicates it is happening with Permanent TSB.  However, the silence from the other four banks is deafening.  Ulster Bank has loosely said it has met its target under the conditions set by the Central Bank.  Making an offer to someone includes offering the assisted foreclosure of the house.  As with other times, I do not trust the banks.  They are packed with individuals who are family, friends and neighbours of us all but, collectively, the banks are only interested in the bottom line, not families of Ireland, which is the responsibility of these Houses.<\/p><p>The Seanad is in its second last day and has a packed schedule but early in the new session perhaps we can have a debate to review progress and see whether banks have engaged in a meaningful way as it appears Permanent TSB has set out to do.  The silence of the four banks in the past number of days is deafening and is evidence of the superficiality with which they have engaged heretofore.  I fear they will continue to engage with the people of Ireland in that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300003#B00100","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1374571800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Every Senator shares Senator MacSharry's desire to have a debate on the budget and I am sure the Leader will endeavour to facilitate it as soon as we return.

As I have said previously, I would very much subscribe to a process whereby the Budget Statement would be a summing up of our full deliberations that would take place in Parliament in the months prior to the budget.  Under the current process the budget is effectively the opening shot.  If Parliament is to be properly reformed and to mean something radical, we would have a completely changed structure where all the various committees and interests, whether it be in the area of education, tourism, arts, culture, housing or the environment, would debate the worthwhile budget submissions we receive, recommendations would be made to the Minister on areas where effective cost savings and spending programmes would be initiated and the Minister would sum up that and that would be the end of the process, as opposed to the beginning of it.

He emphasised the need for the child care debate.  Again I would like to talk about children, although I do so in an indirect way.  A survey was carried out in the US which showed that a healthy breakfast prevents heart disease.  The survey was carried out on 27,000 men over a 20 year period, and it has shown that men who skip breakfast may face a higher risk of heart attack.  I presume the same would hold true for women if the survey was carried out on them.  There is no sexism here and I would presume it would be the case for both.  Everybody should be made aware of the importance of breakfast.  However, the issue I raise today is the importance of breakfast for schoolchildren.<\/p><p>It has been known over the years that children who eat a good breakfast perform better in school, concentrate better in school and have better outcomes, but the sad part is that we do not have any surveys in Ireland.  The Minister for Social Protection launched a pilot project with six schools in association with a commercial company.  If we are to get serious about best outcomes in education, particularly for disadvantaged children, then we should ensure that we start where it matters, at breakfast time.  There are now children who are part of the new poor and cannot afford breakfast, as their parents spend all their money on mortgages and so on.  This is not confined to DEIS areas, it is happening all over Ireland.  Fair play to the Minister for starting the pilot project.   We have an old urban scheme in Dublin and Cork and administered by councils, VECs and so on, but this should be put on national basis.  The Minister for Social Protection has initiated this pilot project in conjunction with the private sector, even if the Minister for Education and Skills should be doing it.  We need to proceed with this in whatever way we go about it.  The figures are there to show that it is a false economy not to do it.  If we are serious about education, we should feed the child and the child will do the rest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300005#D00200","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1374573000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>That is a well made point by Senator Keane.

The paintings of the stations of the cross by the renowned Dublin-born painter and stained glass artist, Evie Hone, are valuable, but they are priceless to the people of Kiltullagh and surrounding areas.  This artist is particularly well known.  Her painting entitled &quot;My Four Green Fields&quot; hangs in Government Buildings, so there is a connection between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the theft in Kiltullagh, near Athenry.

The total number of patients waiting over six months for in-patient treatment and day treatment has doubled from 6,038 in December to 11,985 in June.

It may seem like a frivolous matter on the face of it in the context of economic and other such matters but I have been calling for a debate on nutrition generally for some time.  On the other side of the equation, going without breakfast is a difficulty for some children.  There are also some children who, through no fault of their own and perhaps because of the society in which we live and the lack of education on nutrition, are eating far too much, and there is a huge obesity crisis.  I reiterate my call for a debate on nutrition generally.  There was a healthy eating week in the Houses of the Oireachtas the week before last.  Advertising calorie content is very helpful in highlighting nutrition, which is so fundamental for every human being.<\/p><p>I also echo Senator Mullins' contribution about the paintings stolen in a village near Athenry.  Evie Hone was one of a few female Cubist artists.  She is well recognised but was not very prolific.  The fact that these few paintings have gone missing is significant for that reason.  To reassure Senator Mullins, in my view there would be a very limited market for these paintings abroad simply because most Irish art abroad is sold within a fairly confined market.  Her paintings would be fairly obvious.

Indeed, this year's winter went on significantly longer than normal.  This has left many of the poorest people in Ireland living in fuel poverty and dealing with serious arrears in essential services.  In that context I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government with responsibility for housing and planning, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, on her announcement of the first tranche of funding for an energy efficiency programme for local authority houses.  Some local authority houses are among the worst constructed in the country.  This is a very important measure to deal with the fuel poverty experienced by some of the poorest people in Irish society.  I would like a debate early in our new session, in September, on the matter of the budget, to include further fiscal measures that can be taken to retrofit and improve the heat and fuel efficiency of the Irish housing stock generally.

This year's budget will not take the promissory note of &euro;1 billion into account.  It was asked how could we raise the funds so that we would not have to increase taxes in the forthcoming budget.  I suggest now, as I did this morning to the Minister, that the country needs a transfusion of funds.  During the banking debacle endless billions of Irish money left the State and I believe, although this might not go down too well in some sectors, that now would be an appropriate time for a tax amnesty.  We could repatriate that money and get it working for the economy.  Aside from the immorality of tax avoidance, we need an injection so that the Government will not raise taxes on working people.  An amnesty would be a windfall for the Exchequer.  It will put capital back into the economy.  It will recapitalise the banks and will get the economy working.

There is a huge amount of wasted food in the hands of retailers and suppliers and very much in the hands of individual citizens who buy more food than they need.

It is of such importance to this House and to the Houses of the Oireachtas that any such inducement by any person should be dealt with by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the relevant authority.

Barrett welcomed the Young Fine Gael decision to have freedom to canvass on whichever side they wish on the referendum for the abolition of the Seanad.  It seems the vote was tied and they decided to give that freedom.  Senator Burke raised the same issue about the ESRI report as Senator Keane raised yesterday.  Senator Cullinane raised the matter of the Waterford Crystal workers which he has raised on a number of occasions on the Order of Business.  In my view the workers should be paid 50% at least, up front and immediately.  However, the Government takes its advice from the Attorney General which is that the court case must take precedence.  While we may not agree with that decision, the Government must adhere to it.  I hope that matter will be concluded in a timely manner and that it will not drag on.  Many of these workers are waiting up to ten or 15 years for pension entitlements.  It is neither fair nor just.<\/p><p>  Senator Paul Coghlan asked for a debate on mortgage-holders in distress to be held early in the new term.  Senators Keane, Quinn and Noone, referred to the importance of a good breakfast for schoolchildren.  I note Senator Quinn's reference to the excellent debate on the Food Provenance Bill.  It is proven that a good breakfast results in good outcomes for schoolchildren.  The public consultation committee debated nutrition and healthy lifestyles.  We will have a debate in September on that report.<\/p><p>  Senator Healy Eames referred to an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> and which Senator Wilson also raised.  Of course, abortion is not the only option for women in crisis pregnancies.  I am sure that matter will be debated at length in the future.<\/p><p>  Senator Mullins asked for a debate on jobs.  Senator Noone raised the matter of the robbery of valuable paintings from Killtullagh church.  We all call for a safe return of those paintings.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill asked for a debate on waiting lists.  I am not quite sure to which waiting lists he refers.  If he provides me with the details I can find out the situation for him.<\/p> <p> Senator Terry Brennan referred to Dunleer railway station.

As a result, in the words of Professor Elaine Byrne, \"Ireland was robbed of legislative independence for 120 years.\"<\/p> <p>In this case, by removing the second legislative Chamber, the intention of the Government is that its already powerful position in the Oireachtas in ramming legislation through is made even stronger.<\/p><p>There are also Members of this House appointed by the Taoiseach who I would have expected to exercise their Independent mandate but who have so far backed this Bill.

On Thursday, 5 July 1979, the Irish people voted in a referendum to support a Bill to broaden the electorate for the university seats beyond Trinity College Dublin, and the NUI, incorporating UCD, Maynooth, UCC and UCG, to the graduates of other institutions of higher education in the State such as the equivalent of today's University of Limerick, Dublin City University and the institutes of technology.  Over half a million people voted in favour of this amendment to the Constitution, with only 45,000 voting against it.  As the proposal was duly approved by the people of Ireland, it was signed by the President in August 1979 and promulgated as a law.<\/p><p>  Over the past 34 years since the 1979 referendum, Governments of all political hues, including our own Fianna F&aacute;il governments, have failed to pass the regulations to implement the legislation providing for the extension of the university electorate beyond the current universities.

Forty-three Members of this House are so elected after very competitive contests, certainly among Fianna F&aacute;il Seanad candidates.

The process here of discussing the referendum is exactly what it should be.<\/p> <p>It also is what the Seanad should be, in that if the Government has a proposal to put to the people and if that proposal concerns the future of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, then democracy allows and demands that Members have an opportunity to express their view.  In doing that and in the context of reform, it is important that Members are careful to understand how the word \"reform\" entered the debate.  It virtually has become the mantra of this debate and one must ask how that word rose to the top of the debate.  One must ask how did the Government not foresee this would be the case.  While Members already have gone through this on Second stage, one reason is that much of what happened was exceptionally impulsive and precipitative.  Everyone was taken by surprise when An Taoiseach announced in the middle of an emotional general election campaign that not only was he in favour of the abolition of the Seanad but, if elected, he would proceed along those lines.  Members are aware of what happened as a result of that precipitative strike because no opportunity was given to consider the pros and cons.<\/p><p>I made this point earlier, which is the reason I make the same points in the context of reform.  In the face of such a major proposal, I can never understand the reason a White Paper was not produced.  Everyone is familiar with the purpose of such a White Paper, which collects together the various information that is required to be central to the debate itself.  Had that been the case, I am almost certain that reform would have formed part of such a White Paper.  What now is happening is an effort to catch up, to fill the gaps and to fill the vacuum.  This is one reason the word &quot;reform&quot; has come to the top of the debate.  Incidentally, it is not merely coming from Members of this House but also is coming from media commentators and the people on the street.  I acknowledge everyone moves in different circles and I can only speak about the circle in which I move but in the past three or four weeks, I have been absolutely amazed and of course delighted by the number of people who have availed of the opportunity to speak to me about the Seanad.  I reiterate we all move in our own circles and so one always must make allowances for a degree of prejudice but without exception, everyone who has spoken to me is in favour of its retention.  As Members can appreciate, I did not raise the issue.  Second, almost in the second breath, the word &quot;reform&quot; is mentioned.  I am a great believer in consensus and the more I find this consensus coming forward, the more I realise the opportunity that has been lost by not having reform as part of the referendum.  No one is suggesting there should not be a referendum and no one is suggesting the choice should not be left to the people.  While the choice of course should be left to the people, Members also owe it to them to provide them with as much information as possible.<\/p><p>I have been looking back on the history of the Seanad in so far as I have been involved over a long number of years and I remember people like Senator Shane Ross sitting in this Chamber.  Invariably, the contributions he made on issues relating to banking, finance and the economy of the country to a large degree were ahead of time.  Members used to listen to him in the Chamber in the realisation he had taken a time to research the issues.  Consequently, the suggestion that Members come into the Chamber simply to have rows or arguments is not true.  Of course there is a bit of heat here but there also is a fair degree of light in the debates.  I will not get into the area of comparing the Lower House with the Upper House as I do not believe that serves any purpose but one must look at the track record of the House and I have given Members one example.  I could make the same point in respect of Senator Norris.  It does not matter how many punches are thrown at him as he still comes forward to make his point.  I did not hear him on the &quot;Today with Pat Kenny&quot; show this morning but I am reliably informed he did an exceptionally good job.  It is great that even if punches are thrown at one, one still bounces back if one believes in democracy and in one's contribution to the fabric of democracy.  I have seen that in this House many times.  While partisanship of course exists, it largely comes from the Whip system.  I do not suggest Members should not have a Whip system but it should be examined in the context of reform because it has been sacrosanct, which is not correct.  Members always will argue for its imposition, just as the devil also will argue, in a given situation but I refer to this issue in a general sense.  It should not follow that the Whip system is absolutely and utterly sacrosanct.  There are times when one would have a much more edifying, revealing and informative debate, were the Whip system not to exist.  I sat on the Government side of the House and saw precisely the same thing, that is, people were absolutely straining to express a contrary point of view to that of one's party or the Government if the party also was in government.  Is that not good for democracy?  Are Members so stifled and so much in a straitjacket that this cannot even be considered?  This should have formed part of the debate regarding the Seanad.<\/p><p>When one considers the Seanad being the central issue of reform and debates at present, one knows no major reform is evident.  Certainly, no major thrust towards a radical reform is discernible.  While there may be a certain amount of cosmetic change and a certain amount of window-dressing, it is a terrible feeling when one knows within oneself this is not correct and one is dealing with public relations gimmicks in that regard at a time when the country is in such a terrible state.  Members are all told - and it is true - that politicians are not held in the highest esteem.  While a person may feel he or she is held in high esteem, that is not the case as the entire body politic is not held in high esteem at present.  There is great cynicism, scepticism and lack of trust and consequently, the suggestion that with a stroke of a pen one may abolish one House of Parliament and that in some way, this will give one greater oversight, responsibility, accountability or transparency does not stand up to any logical examination.  All Members in this House know this to be true but if this is the case and they are trying to sell a pig in a poke to the people, who already do not trust them, do Members honestly believe, whatever the outcome of the referendum, the body politic will be enhanced and enriched?  It will not and what will happen eventually is there will be a breakdown in the democratic structures in the State and one already can discern a degree of erosion in this regard.<\/p><p>Consequently, one should consider the position in respect of the Seanad and one should consider reform.  That Members of this House went to the trouble of drawing up Bills with regard to the reform of the Seanad demonstrates how seriously they were taking it.  However, one can go back far further than that point and I recall the review conducted under the former Leader of the House, Mary O'Rourke, into which many Members put a lot of time.  I do not suggest for a moment that Members were not conscious of in some way defending their own little territory.  That is a human thing and one should forget about it for a moment.  However, the extent of the consultation and the amount of time given to it by Members of this House were huge.  At the time, I believed Members were on the right road and I still look back at the proposals that were put forward.  They refer to the method of election, to the duties and so on and two of those possibilities for reform kept rising to the top.  At a time when Members thought everything was settled and placid, Senator Barrett raised a very important point the other morning regarding the dangerous potential of the riots in Belfast.  It was the same earlier this year in respect of the flags controversy.  If one looks back on the documents on reform, the authors suggested this House was the only one that had the potential to interact with Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>Perhaps we were the only ones who had the opportunity to do something to ensure that a fragile peace process would not be sundered.  That was important.  For example, when representatives of the Orange Order came to the House, that in itself was historic.  People had doubts about it but we could see that one could have debate and one could still think of the present and the future and not be a prisoner of the past.  There was an opportunity in the context of reform.<\/p><p>How often do we hear, out among the public, that we no longer have control of our own destiny and that our sovereignty has been diluted because we are now subservient to Europe?  Let us look at the smallest issues.  Where, for instance, one had a few hens that were fed with offal and had eggs at home, one now must register the hens to satisfy Europe.  People who were doing some home baking and selling apple tarts and cakes to the local shop as wholesome food have had to change their kitchens and use stainless steel.  I am taking the most insignificant examples merely to indicate where we are.  There are directives coming in by the tonne from Europe and it has been suggested that there is a committee to look at that.  The committee structure is not working.  It is as simple as that.  One sits at a committee, as I do, and sees it as little more than a talking shop.  It is a cosmetic exercise.  It has no teeth whatsoever.  Even in the case of the committee dealing with European issues, there is absolutely no way it is in any context looking at these directives and examining their impact.  There is an opportunity, incidentally, within the structures of Europe to confront those types of directive.  I think we have done this only once.  Here was a very capable House with plenty of experienced Members, who are prepared to do their research and who are genuine and positive and trying to make change.  Here was an opportunity.  Those were two of the main proposals.  It was not within the remit of the Seanad to do anything about that reform.  We do not have that power.  That power rests with Government.  When we talk about no reform for 75 years, we all know full well that is a distraction.  It does not add up.  We did our homework and the proposals are still there.  I still ask people to look at that homework.  Even the public would be surprised at our efforts.  However, we were stymied.  The Government did not accept our proposals.<\/p><p>Let us be frank in stating that we provide the people with the opportunity to make this decision.  We have not given them a choice, or at least it is a stark choice - to be or not to be.  Is that what our present difficulties require?  Is that what democracy requires at present?<\/p><p>Looking back to the beginning of this campaign, it was quite evident that little thought had gone in to the arguments being put forward by the Government.  On the cost of the Seanad, for instance, I have heard figures gradually fall from &euro;100 million to &euro;50 million as people became a little sceptical.  Then they came down from &euro;50 million to &euro;20 million.  Now we know the cost is &euro;8.2 million.  I have come to the conclusion that if we wait long enough, we will not be costing anything but will be making a profit.  That is the type of debate.  In the circle in which I move, many people have been coming forward because they see what is happening in this regard.<\/p><p>We were then promised a super-committee.  The other committees are not working.  We have amalgamated committees in the past two years and there is not even time to talk.  Now there will be this super-committee, which will be a Seanad by another name.  It will not be democratic because it will not be elected.  As to who will select the members, it will be the Government.  As to who will be on this committee, it will largely be members of the Civil Service.  This is meant to fill the gap that will be created by removing a House of Parliament.<\/p><p>We seem to be left with little or nothing to propose or to support the idea of this referendum, but there is still the strong mantra of reform, and that suggests to me, as I have always felt, a discerning electorate.  There are people who are very well informed and they realise that no case has been made - one may exist, but I do not know - for the abolition of the Seanad.<\/p><p>I was somewhat surprised in recent days when one commentator wrote that a comment somebody made in the House was the reason we should get rid of the Seanad.  Is that the level of that we are talking about?  Is that what democracy means to us - a single comment by a single person?  Would that not also mean we should get rid of the D&aacute;il, when one looks at some of the comments being made there every day?  That is a little disturbing.<\/p><p>I do not regard myself as an intellectual.  I am an ordinary person, but I am a person, like all of the Members, who feels strongly for the welfare of the country.  I also feel strongly for the people who are suffering.  I felt this particularly strongly this morning when listening to the radio, when I heard there would be a large number of evictions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, knows as well as I do - I will not go too deeply into that - that the very word &quot;eviction&quot; strikes terror and anger into the heart of an Irish person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300010#J04700","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374576600,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Quite rightly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300012#L00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1374576600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Many of these people are not responsible for the position they are in.

Assuming the referendum does not succeed, we have lost the opportunity for reform that would require constitutional change.  Nobody will be rewarded for having made that mistake.  The abolition of the Seanad is becoming a much bigger issue than the Seanad itself.  The Government's suggestion of abolition and the way it is being handled will cast a spotlight on the way Government operates here.<\/p> <p>We talk about democracy.  What democracy is there for a backbencher in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann?  I have never served there but, having observed it, I believe its Members fill a gap and press a button.  Can one sleep at night if one sells one's soul like that?  There are only a few Ministers running the country at present.  They may be lucky and get it right but if they get it wrong, which is always possible, people will suddenly ask why they got rid of the Seanad and whether they had not realised that only four people were running the country and everybody else was just pressing a button when told to do so.  That type of democracy may have served in the past when the partisanship that goes with party politics was accepted.  As I stated, times, society and the world change, and we change as individuals.  The discerning electorate has now been given a single focus to be able to examine the bigger picture.  The single focus is the fact that a Government, in the present dire straits of the country, wants to get rid of a House where accountability would be to the fore and where we could help and work together for the good of the country. <\/p><p>That is all I want to say on this but I am possibly whistling in the wind.  Sometimes, however, people stop and listen when one does that.  There will be other contributions along the same lines.  It is interesting how a single sentence can trigger a reaction.  The trigger will not be the big headlines or megaphone diplomacy but a single issue.  Suddenly, the people will ask whether they are being made fools of in the biggest way possible, namely, through the taking away of a House that would give Members responsibility and allow for accountability.  I urge the Minister of State, a decent man who served here with us and impressed us all, although I know he will not change the view of the Taoiseach on this matter, to say to the Taoiseach that Members of this House are not trying to be anti-Government.  We are not trying to be smart or insult anybody; all we are genuinely trying to do is reflect what we know to be the case on the ground.  Sometimes arrogance is an obstruction to that reflection and echo.  Perhaps we should all be less arrogant in our approach and do that for the good of the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300012#L00500","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374577200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300013#M00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1374577200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>It is always wonderful to listen to Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, whose interventions are always very thoughtful and considered.  I hope what he said today will be reported.  I had not intended to speak but earlier events have encouraged me to do so.  I take my role as a legislator very seriously.  In addition to being a legislator, I am a citizen who is directly affected by the legislation we pass and referendums to change the Constitution, as will be the case when the question of Seanad abolition comes before the people in the autumn.  As such, in approaching this Bill I endeavoured to balance my Senator's hat and my private citizen's hat appropriately and honestly.  As an active Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I see its flaws, live the frustration and understand the criticisms.  On the other hand, I have experienced the capacity of the Seanad to scrutinise Bills, secure greater human-rights-proofing of legislation and policy and add a layer of expertise and consideration that is often lacking in D&aacute;il debates.  At the very least, the Seanad is in need of radical reform, but so too is the D&aacute;il if we are to resuscitate political democracy.  As it stands, I am utterly unconvinced about the D&aacute;il's ability to deliver the self-reform needed to plug the hole in checks and balances that would be left by Seanad abolition.<\/p><p>I went into some considerable detail on these points in my Second Stage intervention and made it clear that I would not impede the passage of the Bill through the House.  Arriving at my position on this incredibly important question is a journey I am still in the process of making.  However, as reflected in my intervention on Second Stage and my vote against the motion tabled by my colleagues to recommit the Bill to Committee Stage and consequently delay the referendum, I believe this is a question for the people alone to answer.  If we were to have invoked the 90-day delay, I wish we had done so regarding respite care.  I could not, in good conscience, have this as the first occasion in my term as a Senator on which we would invoke the delay.  I do not believe I should have to.  The only conversations I had with people last week prior to my vote were with colleagues who wished me to vote in support of the motion.  Most were respectful but, unfortunately, not all were.  I will let that sit in the past, however.  The record of this House will clearly show that, on each and every decision, I vote with my conscience and with courage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300013#M00300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1374577200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>T&aacute; l&uacute;ch&aacute;ir orm an deis a bheith agam labhairt anseo ar an m&iacute;r seo den d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht agus ar an leas&uacute; at&aacute; curtha chun tosaigh anseo.

That was wrong.  Every Member has an obligation to speak passionately about this issue.  It is on our watch that legislation will be passed to extinguish or abolish this House.  Therefore, we have an obligation not only to ourselves and the House but to every past and prospective Member to uphold the Constitution and speak our minds freely and openly on this very issue.<\/p><p>We are living in the best of times but also living in very dangerous times.  I use the word &quot;dangerous&quot; because of the dictatorial attitude of the Government towards our democratic institutions.  Four members of the Cabinet are ruling the roost and deciding that democracy comes at a price.  That price, as we know, is power.  I say this because, before the last general election, the current Taoiseach, who was then the Leader of the Opposition, committed, against the better judgment of many respectable people within his party, to abolishing an institution of the Oireachtas, Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The reason, of course, was to gain political popularity for Fine Gael, not to bring about the political reform the country requires.  That was wrong and no one, irrespective of what office he holds, should play politics with any institution of the State, particularly the democratic institution of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>There will be a vote on this issue this afternoon.  Members of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, as well as a number of the Independents, will most likely vote in favour of the legislation, which is regrettable, but it shows that the party whip system is clearly being imposed, although not on the Independents, to ensure Members vote in accordance with the Taoiseach's wishes.<\/p> <p>That is exactly what is happening here, nothing else.  The Taoiseach is imposing a party whip system whereby people are voting against their own beliefs.  I appeal to people, even at this late stage, to challenge it and ask whether it is the right thing to do.  In recent weeks, we have spoken about conscience in this House and it has also been discussed in the Lower House and the media concerning another piece of legislation.  Conscience comes into every piece of legislation, however, particularly one which will affect our democracy now and long into the future.  <\/p><p>Ireland does need political reform and that was talked about before the last general election.  We all subscribe to that, including my own party Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, Labour and Fine Gael.  We need to reform the political institutions of the State.  The economic crisis has clearly shown the limits of governmental structures.  In the years leading up to the banking crisis the topic of financial regulation was only mentioned three times in both Houses.  That demonstrates that the Oireachtas suffers from a real lack of perspective and depth.  We need root and branch reform of State institutions, reviewing all aspects of how we make the decisions that govern us as a people and which achieve the common good.  At stake here is the potential for our democracy to thrive and flourish in future.  No one could disagree with that.<\/p><p>In their election manifestos, both Fine Gael and the Labour Party proposed to abolish Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  However, the Government's failure to implement a holistic package of political reform measures means that the abolition of the Seanad will be little more than a cynical side-show, diverting attention from the Government's inaction on creating new politics.  The severely limited Constitutional Convention, which avoids the big issues of Irish politics, exposes the lack of ambition and imagination by the Government for far-reaching reform.  A referendum on the future of Seanad &Eacute;ireann is little more than crude, knee-jerk, populism that will disrupt a significant part of our constitutional architecture with no clear thought of what impact it will have.<\/p><p>We fully recognise that serious questions must be asked about the continued role of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  We all subscribe to that.  If, after 75 years, we are struggling to justify the existence of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, then it is only right that we should ask those questions.  The proposals being put forward by our own party answer those legitimate questions by building on the work of expert reviews and the lessons of the past few years.  It puts forward a fresh vision for the Seanad and will act as a check on the Government, scrutinise legislation, and represent voices that would otherwise not be heard in our national Parliament.<\/p><p>There are other ways of doing this, for example, by examining a reformed, holistic Seanad.  Before the last general election, the Government promised political reform.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, made a big issue of this and said that the way politics was done in this country would be changed forever.  He went before the people promising that and, of course, everyone believed him.  The Irish people voted for Fine Gael on the basis that politics had to be cleaned up and changed.  Everybody subscribed to that idea, but what has happened since?  More quangos have been created and more State jobs have been filled.  I have the facts to prove it.  The biggest quango of all was created when the direct elections to the State board, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, were dropped.  Some 16 people were democratically elected to it since 1979.  However, a piece of legislation was driven through this House but when I and others tried to amend it not one amendment was accepted.  Since then, those 16 places have been replaced by 12 Fine Gael and Labour Party activists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300013#M00400","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374577800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>It is outrageous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300014#N00400","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1374577800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>They are not from Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in or Independents, but people with political affiliations to the Government parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300014#N00500","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1374577800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I must remind the Senator that we are on Report Stage and I have been very lenient to all speakers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300014#N00600","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1374577800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I am making a point about the promises that were made and where we have gone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300014#N00700","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1374577800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I am not sure that is relevant to amendment No. 28.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300014#N00800","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1374577800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I agree that I may have gone off the point slightly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300014#N00900","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1374577800,"counter":174,"content":"<p>They are abolishing elected bodies over there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300014#N01000","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1374577800,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Exactly.  Senator Barrett has articulated his arguments very well on this issue.  I come from a county which adjoins the Border, but of course we no longer recognise the Border.  We live in a 32-county Ireland, which is the way I envisage it.  As someone who spent five years living in the North of Ireland just before the Good Friday Agreement, during a time of relative peace, I can say more than most that the part played by this Republic in bringing about that peace was substantial.  It has proved to be long-lasting and we all welcome that, but we should not disenfranchise any community in the North of Ireland by an action that would remove a democratic institution in this State.  The abolition of the Seanad would remove an opportunity for the people in the North to be represented in the Upper Chamber of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>I travel through the North of Ireland when going up and down to Donegal.  I have many friends in the North of Ireland with whom I went to college and others who live in the North.  I visited the North of Ireland the weekend before the Twelfth celebrations.  I witnessed at first hand the peace and tranquility that exists there.  There have been outbursts during the last week or ten days but the part being played by the Oireachtas to highlight those outbursts is particularly articulated by our university Senators, given that many graduates - particularly from Trinity but also from NUI - are living in the North of Ireland.<\/p><p>This House has always been a place where the views, expressions and concerns of the minority within our population were expressed but also, more importantly, were represented.  Down through the years, exceptional Members of this House have come from the North of Ireland, including S&eacute;amus Mallon and others.  It would be a disservice to the people of the North of Ireland, and to this Government's commitment to the North of Ireland, if the Seanad were to be abolished in one fell swoop.  <\/p><p>What explanation can the Minister of State give to the people living in the North of Ireland for whom Fine Gael has proclaimed to work hard over the years?  I acknowledge the work that was done by the late Dr. Garret FitzGerald through the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I am sure, however, that Dr. FitzGerald would not subscribe to the abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  One of the founding fathers of Fine Gael, Michael Collins, played an integral role in the establishment of this House.  He certainly recognised the need to represent people in the North of Ireland.<\/p><p>The plan to abolish the Seanad does a grave disservice to those living in the North.  I want to hear what explanation the Minister of State can offer to those people.  What consultations have taken place with minority groups in our society concerning the abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann?  One can only presume that those discussions have taken place.  No Government in any democracy would ram through a piece of legislation without consulting minority groups in the Republic or the North.  I can only assume that such consultations have taken place.  Perhaps the Minister of State can outline what those consultations were, where they took place and how many members were consulted from each community.  I refer in particular to members of the Protestant communities, both in the Republic and the North of Ireland.<\/p> <p>This House has many great opportunities.  Apart from building and developing on its potential to build a greater Ireland, North and South, and to work closer with the Stormont Assembly, it can work with minority groups in our society, religious or otherwise, to develop the holistic Ireland we all want to achieve.  This House has a role to play in all of this.<\/p><p>Members have an obligation to protect this House and ensure future generations can be represented through it.  We must ensure, however, that the representation they receive is better than what the House is providing now.  This House needs to be drastically reformed.  It is no accident that the Government ignored 12 reports on Seanad reform since its foundation.  I accept my party also ignored it when it was in government which was a grave mistake.  Action should have been taken at the time to deal with some of those reform proposals, particularly the excellent 2002 report by the former Minister and then Leader of the House, Mary O&rsquo;Rourke.  There was also a referendum in 1979 on the Seanad franchise which was never implemented.<\/p><p>There are alternatives to abolition.  They should be provided to the people by way of referendum where they can have an honest say and a choice, not a knee-jerk reaction because it is politically popular.  I subscribe to what Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said regarding the sentiment of the electorate.  I have consulted widely on this particular issue in my constituency in Donegal.  The feedback I have received, even on the street, is a positive one.  People do not want to see the Seanad abolished.  They certainly want to see Seanad reform but they are very afraid of this dictatorial attitude coming from the Government with its huge majority in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>We have seen over the past week how this House made the Government uncomfortable.  That is the way it should be.  We also now know why the Taoiseach wants to get rid of this House.  He envisages that he will still be Taoiseach after the next general election.  He has a greater plan to ensure he has more control and fewer long speeches against his own popularity coming from this House.  He wants the four Ministers at the heart of Government in the fiscal Cabinet sub-committee to be insulated with their power not undermined while the majority in the D&aacute;il will continue to vote in favour of their policies.  We are going down a dangerous road.  If we are serious about reforming politics, then we need to examine every aspect of it, including the party Whip system within certain divisions.  No party in any other parliament in the world would throw out honourable and respectable party members just because they voted in accordance with their consciences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300014#N01100","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374578400,"counter":177,"content":"<p>We are not a long way from Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s past in this regard too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300015#O00200","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1374578400,"counter":178,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach chose to do so.

We are going down a slippery road.  At this late stage, will Government Members, including the Independent ones, consider if they are doing the right thing by allowing a flawed referendum to proceed?  If there were a referendum held on any institution of the State, including the D&aacute;il, without a proper choice made available, the people would probably vote to get rid of the D&aacute;il as well.  We have to be honest with the people.  We cannot send a referendum to the people under a charade of lies.  Misinformation is being given about the cost savings.<\/p><p>Will Government Members abstain from voting or vote against this Bill?  This is an issue of fundamental importance to future generations.  It will define how democracy is carried on and how people are represented long into the future.  It will tear up our Constitution.  As Michael McDowell, a man whom I respect, has written extensively, it would be easier to rewrite Bunreacht na &Eacute;ireann than to let this referendum proceed.<\/p> <p>I appeal to those Members on the opposite side to consider their options when this vote comes up today, because this is not the right thing to do.  One can argue that we should let the people have their say, but what are we actually saying?  We are giving people a smokescreen of a political gimmick of a choice when they should be afforded a real choice and when we should have a real debate on whether this Seanad should be retained or reformed.  That is what the debate should be about, but it will only be about whether the Seanad stays as it is or is extinguished.  If we allow the referendum to go ahead on that basis, we will not have the debate this House deserves.  No Senator who votes for this piece of legislation can appear on any media outlet and say credibly that he or she supports reform, because he or she is not giving the people the opportunity to vote for reform.  <\/p><p>It is never wrong to change one's mind and it is never too late to do the right thing.  Members should either abstain from the vote, make themselves scarce or vote against this piece of legislation, because the people deserve an option.  Members should reflect on the &euro;15 million that the Minister and his Government are spending this year on the European space programme.  How is that benefiting any of us or any citizen of the country?  This is a sum of &euro;15 million.  It is outrageous and disgraceful and does not help this country to get out of austerity.  At least we can play a role in parliamentary democracy.  Whether we are here or not does not matter.  It is about who will be here in the future and the future of the House, our democracy and our Constitution as we know it.

I did not intend to speak on section 28 but there is a misapprehension among some of my esteemed colleagues about my rationale.  We are opposing each other on this occasion.  I will explain my rationale in very slow and methodical language.  I regret that I also hear that my esteemed colleagues Senators Barrett and Darragh O'Brien and my eloquent and esteemed colleague Senator O'Sullivan all feel either ashamed or disappointed on my behalf.<\/p><p>In my business I produce many plays, which are normally three-act plays.  I suggest that the first act of this process is a farce - a farce in terms of the Government's response and approach to political reform.  I do not intend to repeat my Second Stage speech but if Senators Darragh O'Brien and Barrett and, in particular, Senator O'Sullivan had read or indeed attended the Chamber and heard my Second Stage speech, they would not have lost too much energy and would not be surprised at why I voted the way I did.  I explained how I was going to vote and will continue to vote in the same way.  I will explain in a minute, including to that other esteemed Senator, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, why I voted the way I did and how clear it was.  <\/p><p>The farce related to the Taoiseach's approach to political reform and having multiple avenues of reform.  First of all, the D&aacute;il reform package is just non-existent.  We are having this debate on Seanad reform without seeing any clear-thinking and accurate presentation of D&aacute;il reform.  I said this to the Minister of State in my Second Stage speech, so I will not repeat it.  The committee process does not work.  There are not enough committees.  Some committees are dependent on enlightened Chairmen and Ministers who take the committees seriously.  We know some Ministers just do not take them seriously.  We then had the Constitutional Convention, as I explained in my Second Stage speech.  <\/p><p>If the farce I described in Act One is about that, Act Two is about the melodrama of this House and the pallor of disappointment and perceived shame felt by Senator Barrett about the way I voted.  The third act has yet to be written and concerns the reason I voted against the recommittal motion and the fact that the Government ruled my amendment out of order.  The aim of my amendment was to include in the Bill a clause suggesting that if this referendum is defeated, the reform of the Seanad would go straight to the Constitutional Convention, which would report back to the Oireachtas.  That is why I am voting in favour of this Bill.  This could be difficult for Senators Barrett and &Oacute; Domhnaill, so I will give them the A, B and C.  By voting for this Bill, I am not voting for the abolition of the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300016#P00400","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1374579000,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300016#P00500","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1374579000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>That is the point.  I am disappointed that Senators Barrett and Darragh O'Brien, to whom I am referring because they are not in the House, feel disappointed on my behalf.  I am also disappointed that they feel ashamed on my behalf.  To be clear about it, I have been consistent.  I admire much of Senator Zappone and Senator Quinn's Bill and much of Senator's Crown's Bill.  What is abusive about this debate is that the Taoiseach has given us a very narrow choice with which I am extremely uncomfortable and which I do not like - abolition or retention, when it should be abolition or reform.  However, let us do the numbers.  With the Whip as it is, regardless of whether the recommittal was voted for, we would have wasted another 90 days in this House.  The more we talk about ourselves in this House, which is where the melodrama comes in, the less likely it is that this referendum will be defeated.  That is a fact.  That is Act Three.  We need to get out of here as quickly as possible and allow civil society to debate what I consider to be one of the most important elements of our democracy, which is our parliamentary democracy.  It is the connection between our parliamentary democracy and our citizens through participation and trust.  I believe in a bicameral model and an Upper House that is reformed and I believe this will be achieved by voting \"No\" to the referendum and not by filibustering or agreeing to the recommittal of the Bill.  The longer we speak to ourselves and the more dramatic we are in our speech, the more likely it is that the extremes on both sides will be reported in the newspapers and that the middle ground will not be achieved.<\/p><p>The sense of disappointment and the pallor of melodramatic fugue in this House are not found outside.  Even though they have been given a very convoluted and almost perverted choice, I believe that Irish citizens will vote &quot;No&quot; and for reform.  The sooner we get out of here, the sooner we will have that debate.  Let me be clear once more, because an impassioned speech was made.  I voted against the recommittal because we will do damage to the debate on a bicameral model if we continue to spend time on this.  That debate needs to be a national conversation outside Parliament because there will be a movement and coalition of politicians, activists and community workers from all sides who believe they cannot trust 158 Deputies at the next election and a Presidential-style Government.  The great weakness in the Government's argument is that it has not shown any D&aacute;il reform.  It has introduced the famous Friday sittings but there is no evidence of reform that works.  It has crowded the committee system and there are mixed signals.  What are we afraid of?<\/p> <p>Are we afraid of reform or are we afraid of not being elected once reform is complete?  I am in the lucky position of not having been elected but I expect future reform will not include nominated Senators.  Perhaps some of us are afraid that we might not have the capacity to be elected.<\/p><p>I am voting in favour of the legislation in order that our citizens will become more involved in the debate through a referendum campaign but I am not voting for abolition.  The referendum can be defeated as along as the conversation occurs nationally and not in this Chamber.  That was the reason I voted with my conscience on Second Stage, although &quot;conscience&quot; is an overabused word.  Members have expressed sympathy or anxiety about how I reached my decision and whether I was influenced.  I was influenced by my own political beliefs and interest in how I think reform should occur.  I had those discussions with myself but, in fairness to myself, I plead with Senators O'Sullivan, White, O'Brien, Whelan, &Oacute; Domhnaill, Quinn and Barrett to read my Second Stage contribution and not to in any way over exert their anxieties about me or over exert their own consideration for me.  I acknowledge they are worried sometimes about how I might vote but my record stands, as does that of my colleague on respite care.<\/p><p>I am in favour of reform and the Bill being put to the people as soon as possible because the numbers do not stack up in the House and we should get it out there.

How the Taoiseach has approached certain issues has been a massive disappointment.  I am hugely proud of the fact, irrespective of my political leanings, that somebody from the west is Taoiseach.  His election was a proud day for all on the western seaboard.  However, most recently, the shenanigans relating to membership of committees last week and the nature of this proposal have been disappointing.  They make Mugabe and Idi Amin look like Kofi Annan.  There is nothing wrong with asking the people whether the Seanad should be retained except when the full energies of the State are ploughing in one direction.  I would be much more comfortable with a recommittal of the Bill to give us an opportunity to ask whether we get rid of the House or reform it.  That would be reasonable and if the Bill was recommitted, that could be done on Committee Stage.  I favour that approach and I would be all for a referendum if that were done.  It is not a question of fearing the people.  I do not know, irrespective of whether I continue my political career, whether I will ever seek re-election to the Seanad.  Hopefully, I will have a long life with many options.  I have changed career a few times and I am sure I can again.<\/p><p>However, democracy in this State is managed and prescribed.  If we seek to remove threads of democracy without considering in advance what will be used to replace them, that is a serious problem.  To only ask the people to abolish the House is dangerous because we do not know what will come after.  Given the cynicism and understandable anger and frustration among people at the system failing them politically over the years, regardless of who was in government, although I have no problem admitting Fianna F&aacute;il was in government more often than any other party and it will take its share of the blame, as it did in the most recent election, some of the commentary by the director of elections on behalf of the Government, including during a radio debate I had with him last week, only adds to this.  I mentioned on Second Stage that I asked him how many times the Government amended legislation in the House last year and he could not answer and I asked him how many times as Minister he had amended legislation and he was not able to tell me.  There is a credibility issue.  If a Minister is going to direct a campaign on behalf of the establishment and says this is good for the people and they must get rid of the House, the least he should do is be fully informed about what the House does, albeit in its flawed state as he sees it.<\/p><p>In a retort to me during a somewhat intemperate outburst, he said on air the numbers are rigged in the House to guarantee the Government's success.  That is true but the Government Whip ensures that is the case.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and others have questioned who ensures that outcome.  I recall the frustration of sitting on the Government benches reading a Private Members' motion penned by Senator Brian Hayes at the time and waiting for the Government amendment to be sent over from Government Buildings.  Such Government motions commend the Government on this, that or the other.  I used to hate it and it was frustrating but it is still happening.  Who ensures that remains the case?  The Taoiseach of the day has control.  Deputy Richard Bruton in his capacity as director of elections live on Highland Radio with me last week was right to say that it is a rigged scenario where the Government is guaranteed as a majority but, as Senator Norris correctly pointed out earlier, with 78 amendments tabled on Report Stage and 77 ruled out of order, one must wonder by whom?  It is the same people who rig the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300017#Q00600","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1374579600,"counter":210,"content":"<p>The Cathaoirleach makes the decision on the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300017#Q00700","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374579600,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I am sorry but one wonders about the method of his deliberations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300017#Q00800","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1374579600,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I ask the Senator to read the Constitution regarding referendum Bills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300017#Q00900","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374579600,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I will.  It is the most peculiar coincidence that of 78 amendments, 77 were ruled out of order.  We had the shenanigans last week regarding committee membership, which undermine the entire democratic fabric of the country.  Regardless of who has been in government since the 1950s, I refer to the tangible direction of the changes from one Government to the next.  The Progressive Democrats is the only party that can take credit for pushing politics further right that some of us were happy with.  However, directionally, little has changed.  That tells us the permanent government is in full control.  We have all been in meetings with civil servants even at our minnow level where the boxes do not connect and, for example, we hear, \"We cannot do that with the Ardvarney school bus in County Leitrim because it does not connect to this box over here.\"<\/p> <p>Instead, the very function of our job here, whether it is as politicians or civil servants, is to make the boxes connect, not to decide that something cannot be done because the boxes do not connect.  Our job is to connect the boxes.  I would like to see a recommittal on the basis that people would be asked whether they preferred reform, along with a schedule of suggestions which would be kicked to the convention out in Malahide, with a White Paper followed by a Green Paper, or abolition.  That is a real question, one worthy of a leader to put to the people.  However, the notion that the Taoiseach wants to abolish the Seanad because he made a populist suggestion outside the Citywest Hotel and one of his advisers said it would capture the public imagination, - which it clearly did, as it flabbergasted the poor leader of the Fine Gael group, the then Senator Frances Fitzgerald - certainly did nothing to enhance democracy in this country.<\/p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il group will later in the week launch a reform paper in this regard.  What we need is for the Oireachtas - the D&aacute;il and Seanad - not to be subservient to the Cabinet of the day but for the Cabinet of the day to be subservient to the Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300017#Q01000","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374580200,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300018#R00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1374580200,"counter":216,"content":"<p>That would certainly be difficult.

They will not.  They say: \"What are we doing in here, talking to these muppets?  We are the people.  We are the machine.  They are only the tools.\"  It ought to be the other way around.<\/p><p>While I do not know if many would agree with me on this, our system needs to be similar to the Congressional system, so that a Taoiseach is elected and then picks Ministers, and perhaps five of those Ministers could come from civil society.  For example, Senator Mac Conghail could be the Minister responsible for the arts - we could not have a better person - and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, might be chosen given his educational background.  These Ministers would then step out of Parliament and there would be a panel of people to take their seats.  The Ministers would have to come to sell their policy to the Parliament of the day.  If there are contentious issues such as abortion or measures with regard to banking, people can put their genuine views on the floor of the House without fear of being removed from a committee or without fear of losing the Whip.  Deputy Mathews has shown respect to this House by coming to listen to the debates when he could be on his holiday break.  That is real democracy.

I understand Senator Norris was excellent on the radio this morning.  However, the more of those from civil society and the fewer Senators who are on the radio or any other media on this issue, the better for any potential reform.<\/p><p>Senator Mac Conghail also said that many of us would not relish the thought of an election.  I can tell him there are many of us who would.  Even if we have come through the process we have, we would be quite willing to face the people.<\/p><p>The point was made that there might be 30 civil servants in the ante room feeling disgruntled at the fact they are here at all.  We should look to a situation in which we challenge the civil servants and Ministers, as we have done on many occasions.  I would love to be in a Seanad that was not just seen as a hoop that had to be gone through to get the legislation or the budget through, and where it was genuinely seen as a challenge.  While I am not sure the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, would be kind enough to say it, on many occasions Ministers and civil servants are genuinely challenged in this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300018#R00600","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1374580200,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I will not delay the House as I have already contributed on Second Stage and on a number of occasions on Committee Stage.  Suffice to say I have been watching with some interest the media campaign that has been going on, which has been alluded to by a number of Senators.  It staggered me that because of the way the debate went here in the last week or two, particularly in regard to the abortion issue, which perhaps is the most emotive and divisive to come before both Houses, somehow there was a suggestion among the commentariat that we had let ourselves down.  I do not understand that.  This is a political Chamber as much as anything else.  It may not be seen to be as adversarial as the D&aacute;il but it is still a political Chamber and people still have opinions.  People hold very strong opinions in regard to the Bill on abortion and also in regard to the Bill before us here - why would they not, particularly in regard to the abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann?  Are we to go meekly like lambs to the slaughter?  It is important, indeed essential, that people on all sides of the House should express their opinions.  What I have noticed is that there is a continuing exchange or dialogue going on through the letters pages of all of the national newspapers.  Unlike some issues that tend to come and go as flavour of the month, this one has been running for quite some time, and I believe it will run right up to the time of the referendum.<\/p><p>I agree with everybody who has made the following point.  I cannot for the life of me understand why the Taoiseach decided that it was going to be a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; vote on abolition.  However, it is plainly obvious that he wants to be rid of the House and that he does not really want to have any debate or discussion about it.  As far as he is concerned, and listening to the deputy director of the campaign most recently on radio, there is no need for it whatsoever.  That is what this debate has been about, namely, to have an exchange of views to justify the reasons this House should continue.  We are now in the final analysis and it will be down to the people to decide.<\/p><p>I will leave the House with this thought, which I mentioned on Second Stage.  It has been only on very rare occasions that a lack of political consensus on a referendum has actually ensured the passage of that referendum.<\/p> <p>There is no political consensus on this matter in the country.

Yesterday Senator Ned O'Sullivan referred to them as quasi-Independents.  The debate spurred me to enter the Chamber.  I have already made my feelings on this legislation well known, but I must take exception to Senator Fiach Mac Conghail's contribution.  With respect, the Senator is well versed in treading the boards and acting the part.  When it comes to theatre, theatrics and acting, one must be sure one has learned one's lines before taking to the stage.  It is clear to anyone who received today's Order Paper - it is even on the television screens now for those who have not seen it - that the first item to be dealt with is the Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution - in brackets for slower learners - (Abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann) Bill 2013.  That is what every Member will vote on.  It is as simple as that.  I do not know whether Senator Fiach Mac Conghail or some of the other Independents are being prompted from backstage, but they certainly have not learned their lines or certainly do not know what they are talking about.  It is there in black and white for all to see that we will vote on the abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Obviously, they are not clear on it.<\/p><p>I want to make this point because I took exception to the speech made.  Although I see it happen a great deal in political life, one cannot talk out of both sides of one's mouth.  One nails one's colours to the flag; one cannot be all things to all people.  Too many Members are trying to do just this.  I respect many of my colleagues on the Government side who have refuted the Bill.

I agree with every word of Senator James Heffernan's contribution.  I welcome the Minister of State, but I am disappointed that the Taoiseach has not spent more time in the House, apart from a few minutes on Second Stage.  He acted like a school bully, throwing a box before running away to leave someone else deal with the ensuing chaos.  I was disappointed last Wednesday when he chose to launch a colleague's book instead of attending this House for even half an hour or an hour to listen to comments from both sides on Committee Stage of this important Bill.  It is not important for me or colleagues on any side of the House but for the people and the Constitution.  Without a doubt, the Bill is tinkering with the Constitution and wrong.  Those Senators who vote for the Bill - not me - are voting to get rid of the House.  They may delude themselves by claiming that they are voting to lay legislation before the people in a referendum.  These are the facts.<\/p><p>The least the Taoiseach could do is spend a little time in the House to listen to our debate, not the spin of those reporting to him.  I am referring to the facts, as outlined by colleagues on all sides of the House.  As Senator Sean D. Barrett pointed out on Second Stage, it is disappointing that the Taoiseach spent four times more time cycling the Ring of Kerry than he has spent in this House since becoming Taoiseach.  That is not acceptable.  It is an insult to the House and every Senator.<\/p><p>Arguments have been made by the Government as to why the referendum is going ahead.  I welcome Senator Fiach Mac Conghail's comments, in that he has clarified his position on the legislation and his reasons for voting with the Government.  However, it is a sad afternoon for those Fine Gael and Labour Party Senators who will be forced to vote for legislation to which they are opposed.  Not one Government Senator wants to vote for it, if the truth were told, and it is wrong that they are being forced to do so.  A colleague on the Government side has alleged that an attempt was made to bribe him.  He needs to clarify the position.

I am not referring to the Minister of State before us, I hasten to add.  If that had happened, the issue of the cost of this House would not arise.<\/p><p>Daniel O'Connell fought for Home Rule all his life and his political life's work ended in failure because Home Rule was not achieved in his lifetime.  There is a portrait near the D&aacute;il staircase of the first Lord Oriel, John Foster, who did not believe in Catholic emancipation or that any Catholic should sit in an Irish Parliament.  He did not even believe they should have had the vote, but his portrait is in a place of honour in these Houses because, as the last Speaker of the old Irish Parliament, it was his job to read the result of the vote of the Act of Union, which he fought long and hard to try to prevent.  He fought those who accepted bribes, titles and land, and he succeeded with the first vote before failing on the second.  As he read the result and went to take the mace that symbolised that the Parliament was in session, he believed he would some day have the honour of bringing that mace back to the House of Commons and the House of Lords, which was just over the road from us.  It took 118 years to bring a Parliament back.  Many people like Daniel O'Connell, who fought to bring it back, were not able to achieve it in their life's work.<\/p> <p>In the past two and half years we have seen a loss because the Government legislated for a 40% reduction in representation, at local authority level, by the dismantling of town councils.  If today's proposal goes through we will lose one third of the Parliament and a democratically elected body.<\/p><p>My colleague, Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, pointed out the loss of the democratically elected members of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta who were replaced by experts, as is proposed for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  If &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is an example of how experts will be picked then they will all have some link to the Government.  If Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in or some other party were in power, in years to come, the same thing would happen and supporters of the Government party or parties would be appointed in our place.  Such people will replace the Seanad just as was done with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  <\/p><p>We have yet to see the D&aacute;il or the legislative process reformed. The Leader has heard me talk about our lack of legislative scrutiny many times.  The real work of the Parliament and this House is not to block legislation but amend it.  We have witnessed a democratic deficit on a monumental scale that has not been addressed.  In one calendar year 1,291 EU regulations were brought into this country and Ministers signed 164 EU directives without referring to the D&aacute;il, the Seanad or the committees and passed the legislation without scrutiny.  In one calendar year we have seen 594 statutory instruments, that can amend legislation, passed by this House without ever being referred back to this House.  That is a national democratic deficit of monumental proportions.  Ministers use statutory instruments to change and amend primary legislation.  As many as 28,000 statutory instruments have been signed since the foundation of the State but 25% were signed in the past ten years.  There is more and more centralised power, by the Government, resting in the hands of the few in Cabinet.<\/p><p>We have seen Bills guillotined.  The previous Government could also be accused of guillotining Bills.  We know, at this moment in time, that Bills are being guillotined at an alarming rate.  We have also seen the impact of regulatory impact assessments.  They are supposed to be carried out in advance of legislation to see how will it impede business, and how they will improve or disprove the current situation when it comes to regulations and red tape in this country.  The Government has produced virtually none.  When I asked the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform about how many regulatory impact assessments, RIAs, had been carried out on legislation by his Department in two and a half years, his reply was &ldquo;One&rdquo;.<\/p><p>We are tied up in red tape.  We need to cut it in terms of job creation.  When a report was conducted on Valentia Island, which has a population of 600 people, we found that removing red tape in terms of planning and foreshore licences could create 72 jobs.  That number would be badly needed in any community were it not for red tape.<\/p><p>Secondary legislation, for example, statutory instruments, is amending primary legislation without being referred by Ministers.  There is a little known term called the King Henry VIII clause, which gives Ministers the power to change legislation passed by the Houses without referring it to the Deputies or Senators who passed it in the first place.  Does this sound like a functioning democracy?  Does it sound like a republic or Legislature that is working?  It most certainly does not.<\/p><p>There is a significant absence of scrutiny, which we need to change.  Instead of considering a Bill like this, we should be considering the opportunities afforded to us.  Many Senators have discussed the democratic process and the question of people in the North.  I have referred to how long and hard we struggled to achieve the vote for all citizens.  Daniel O&rsquo;Connell fought for Home Rule and achieved Catholic emancipation 184 years ago.  Women fought for and won the franchise only 95 years ago.  In Derry, people marched 45 years ago for one man, one vote.  This is how hard and long the struggle has been to achieve the vote.<\/p><p>However, not all citizens have that vote.  As has been pointed out by other Senators, only those in the North who came to the South for an education in certain universities have the right to vote in our election.

I am discussing the Constitution, which is about to be amended by this Bill.<\/p><p>Articles 2 and 3 relate to the special relationship between people on this island and in this House and people of Irish heritage overseas.  Rather than deciding that the House should be transformed to accommodate those citizens&rsquo; right to vote in this Parliament, we are removing that opportunity.  The establishment, the Government and the economic council will never give citizens living outside the State the right to vote in a D&aacute;il election.  The only place where they can be given their voice is in the Seanad.<\/p><p>Not only are we dismantling the 75 elements of the Constitution that refer to the Seanad, we are also failing to fulfill the most important parts of the Constitution, Articles 2 and 3, as regards citizens in the North and overseas.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has had a long affinity with the great Kerryman, Daniel O&rsquo;Connell.  He well knows that Daniel O&rsquo;Connell was lambasted for his achievement of Catholic emancipation, in that he did not achieve the vote for everyone.  People&rsquo;s voting rights were qualified.  His entire life&rsquo;s work was not achieved, but neither was Home Rule achieved by others, including John Redmond, to whom the Leader referred.<\/p><p>When one dismantles something, it does not return easily.  It took 118 years to get the old Irish Parliament back into Ireland and for us to have our own Parliament again.  We are wasting an opportunity to reform a political process that clearly does not work, as the Minister of State is well aware.  Our scrutiny of EU legislation and directives is minimal and derisory.  When people wondered whether officials were examining EU directives, a former Taoiseach replied that he was unsure of how much time departmental officials spent reading them.  These are the facts.  Neither we nor the committees are scrutinising directives properly.  Deputies and Senators do not have support staff of their own to ensure that legislation is being handled correctly.<\/p><p>Scrutinising legislation should be the function of this House.  EU directives outnumber Acts of the Oireachtas 3:1, yet the number of amendments being made by the D&aacute;il or the Seanad to those directives is zero.  Amendments are not allowed, as there is no process to provide for them.  Ministers sign directives into law without referring them to the Parliament for scrutiny.  This is an affront to the democratic process, as the Minister of State is aware.<\/p><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.

This House is noted for putting facts on the record and for scrutinising Bills in detail and not allowing misinformation that this Bill is about abolition of the Seanad go out.  The Bill's Title is the Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution (Abolition of the Seanad) Bill.  Abolition of the Seanad is in brackets.  I will give a definition of what brackets mean to those who have not read the Bill correctly.  Brackets are punctuation to interject text within the main text and can be omitted without destroying or altering, in any way, the meaning of the main text.  The main text of the Title is the Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill.<\/p><p>The Constitution is the book of the people, who will speak.  Not a word, a full stop or anything else can be changed without the people speaking.  We, on this side of the House, are giving the power to the people and are giving them their right.  There have been ten reports on the Seanad but nothing has been done; there has been no action from anybody.  Members on the other side of the House were in government for a long time.  It is time to give the people the choice.  We are always talking about participative democracy.  Let the people choose.  Senator Maurice Cummins has brought the people into this House to ensure they are included.  <\/p><p>We are being true to the pledge made in the Fine Gael general election manifesto in 2011 to hold a referendum.  The Government would have been accused of breaking pledges if it did not have one.  I am sorry but one cannot have it both ways.  The Bill, if approved by the people, will make many changes to the Constitution and it would serve this House better if it concentrated more on the minutiae of the amendments and the details of the 70 odd changes to the Constitution which will be made.  We had a good debate on Second Stage, as another Senator pointed out, and I would like such debate continue.  <\/p><p>I would like to hear more debate on the transition provisions in the Bill because one cannot leave the House hanging without any provisions being made.  Transitional arrangements will have to be made.  The Taoiseach, Fine Gael and the Labour Party are giving the choice to the people.  No action has been taken heretofore.  <\/p><p>I think Senator Daly spoke about red tape.  If there was one bit of red tape I could change in this House, it would be repetition.  We talk about a family-friendly environment and time management but I have listened today to much of what I had heard on Second Stage.  We should reform how we do our business in terms of repetition.  Somebody referred to women being given the vote.  Women would get home to their families, as would men, if we engaged in a bit of time management and ensured we said things once and well rather than often.  Something will not get any better even if one repeats it ten times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300021#U00800","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374582600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  I do not think it was ever envisaged that there would be a constitutional amendment to remove one part of the Oireachtas.  It was never considered possible that this would come about.  The Taoiseach and Fine Gael promised to reduce the number of Members of the D&aacute;il by 20 but found that would be in breach of the Constitution and, strangely enough, decided it would not put an amendment to the people on that.  However, when it came to the Seanad, they decided to go ahead with the referendum.  That has never been explained.  The commitment was made to reduce the number of Deputies by 20, with which I would not particularly agree, but it is only going to be reduced by eight, which is constitutional.  This was referred to in the Fine Gael manifesto, which had to be honoured, but it is not being put to the people.  That is not made up, it is a fact.  The Government decided it would not have a referendum on a reduction in the number of Deputies by 20 but it would reduce the number of Oireachtas Members by 60 by abolishing the Seanad.<\/p><p>  On 15 October 2009, the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Act allowed the State to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon.  During the debate, in particular on Lisbon II, it was felt there was a democratic deficit - a distance from the legislative epicentre in Brussels and a growing knowledge gap between the citizens of member states and the Union that may be countered by a strengthened and bolstered role of the Seanad within the European sphere.  Previous fora, such as the National Forum on Europe, which was disbanded, played a role in bringing attention to citizens the mutually beneficial role and future role of Ireland and Europe in their lives.  The Lisbon II campaign saw the activist and mobilizing effect of certain civil society groups, which was welcome.  The Seanad could step up to the plate here.<\/p><p>  The White Paper on the Lisbon treaty, published by the Department of Foreign Affairs, referenced the national parliaments and Houses of the Oireachtas at least 14 times.  Articles 9 to 12 of the Treaty of the European Union deal with the relationship between citizens and the EU institutions.  In addition to references to the relationship between EU institutions, representative associations and civil society and the citizens' initiative, there is reference to the role of national parliaments.<\/p><p>  The White Paper states:<blockquote>The Treaty will give the national parliaments of the Member States a direct input for the first time into European Union legislation.  These provisions are contained in two additional Protocols, one on the role of national parliaments and other on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.<\/blockquote>The people voted on the second Lisbon treaty referendum on the basis that there would be an enhanced role for the D&aacute;il and Seanad and not only the D&aacute;il.  The Seanad was the ideal forum to bring this about - the Leader made every effort in this regard in the past two years - that we would be allowed to scrutinise EU legislation.  This would have been a major and a worthwhile role because one can refer Bills back.  The Minister of State will know the procedure in this regard but it is not being operated.<\/p><p>  The protocol on the role of national parliaments provides for a process where Commission consultation documents - Green and White Papers and<br \/>communications - shall be forwarded directly by the Commission to national parliaments upon publication.  Draft European legislative Acts sent to the European Parliament and to the Council shall be forwarded to national Parliaments.  Draft European legislative acts originating in the EU Commission, European Parliament, European Central Bank, European Investment Bank, European Court of Justice or member states shall also be forwarded to national Parliaments.  Article 3 of the protocol provides that national parliaments may send to the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission a reasoned opinion-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300022#V00200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1374582600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>The Senator is moving away from the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300022#V00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374582600,"counter":263,"content":"<p>No, I am not.  This is the kernel of the Constitution.  We are taking away the power of the amended Lisbon treaty, on which the people voted.  They voted for it on the basis that there would be a direct connection between the treaty and the Seanad.  Given all these factors, the President should refer this Bill to the Supreme Court to assess exactly the position in which it puts the House <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> a decision by the people.  I would be very satisfied to hold a referendum if the Supreme Court decides what we propose is legal, irrespective of the view of the Attorney General's office.  The Attorney General is appointed by the Government.  Although she has an independent position, she relies on the Government for appointment.  She is at the bidding of the Taoiseach and the Government to bring forward the legislation and the regulations to gut the Constitution in regard to the abolition of the Seanad.  The real independent voice in Irish society is the Supreme Court.<\/p><p>  The President will be informed of the wishes of this House.  The President is someone who would read most of the debates, as did Presidents McAleese and Robinson, who were very well informed on the overall discussion on this issue. <\/p> <p>I think the Taoiseach would read most of the debates, as President McAleese and President Robinson did.  They were very well informed on the overall discussion regarding this issue.  To finalise this important point, Article 8 provides that where the national parliamentary system is not unicameral, the above provisions - Articles 1 to 8 - shall apply to the component chambers.  In Ireland's case, both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad will be involved.  The protocol provides for timeframes within which national parliaments will be afforded, advised and furnished of European Union institutional documents, together with the timeframe in which national parliaments are to respond.  In such circumstances, the Seanad or the D&aacute;il would be allowed to refer any legislation back to Europe.  I suggest that would be a very important role for the Seanad.  I have made the point previously that the Seanad can have a role in protecting the rights of the people and Senators can do some work in that regard.<\/p><p>As I have said previously, I have been a Member of both Houses.  I was a Member of the D&aacute;il for longer than I have been a Member of the Seanad.  As I have pointed out, I have also been in the Minister of State's position.  I will not go through that again.  I am not speaking here as someone who has ever shown any disrespect for the Seanad.  I have enormous respect for the Seanad.  I brought the Companies (No. 2) Bill 1987 through this House.  Many companies are going into protection at the moment under the terms of that legislation, which I brought through this House and the D&aacute;il.  The protection afforded to companies under the legislation in question has saved thousands of jobs over the years.  When I brought Bills through this House, I did so with the full support of the Civil Service.  I gave each Bill the time that was necessary.  I did not rush any legislation through.  I was available to take each Bill on behalf of the Department of Industry and Commerce, where I served as Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing, the Department of Health or whatever Department I served in.  Aside from that, I am speaking on the basis of the work I have done since I became a Member of this House.  I have represented Irish people abroad at many events in my capacity as a Senator, sometimes in very difficult circumstances.  I will not go into the details of the case of a particular Irish citizen-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300022#V00400","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374583200,"counter":265,"content":"<p>On the amendment, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300023#W00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374583200,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I am making the point that being a Senator involves more than being in this Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300023#W00300","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1374583200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>The Senator spoke at length on Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300023#W00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374583200,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I did not get around to this point.

There will have been many cases of Members of this House going abroad to successfully represent individuals in difficult circumstances.  More than being in the Seanad Chamber is involved in being a Member of the Seanad.  I am not doing this from any personal point of view.  I know the Bill is going to go through and the question will be put to the people.  At the end of the day, I hope the people will reject the proposal.

He is practically living here at this stage.<\/p><p>  It is quite shameful that the amendment we are debating - No. 28 - is the only one of the 78 amendments that has been accepted for debate.  I am worried that democracy is being endangered in this House.  I have a real concern that democracy is very much in danger in the Oireachtas as a whole - in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad - given that just one of the 78 amendments that have been proposed has been deemed appropriate for debate.  If this Bill is accepted, we will not necessarily have a Seanad to debate these matters unless the citizens vote the right way on referendum day.<\/p><p>  This amendment proposes that an additional 90 days be provided for consideration of this matter.  I do not believe the 110 nominating bodies that have a vested interest in this Seanad have been consulted on this proposal, so we need to make sure they get an opportunity to express their thoughts on it.  It would be appropriate to extend the relevant time period by 90 days so that these bodies can have a say and we can hear their views.<\/p><p>  Senator Barrett has pointed out that quite a few graduates from Northern Ireland have a voice because they can vote in the elections for the NUI seats and the Trinity College seats.  Although they might feel they have some ownership of this House, it does not seem that they will be asked for their opinions before this referendum takes place.  They will not have an opportunity to debate the matter.  They will not even have a chance to vote on it.  It seems wrong.<\/p><p>  What will happen if this Bill is passed and the abolition of the Seanad is debated but the proposal is ultimately defeated by the people?  I hope it will be defeated.  I do not believe we have given it enough attention.  What will happen if the majority of those who vote - only citizens will have the opportunity to do so - vote &quot;No&quot;?  The Taoiseach has already said he does not plan to reform the Seanad in such circumstances.  He is planning to leave it as it is.  I believe that is the topic that should be debated in the next 90 days.<\/p><p>  I know the Taoiseach has said he does not intend to organise a preferendum.  That is okay because it may not be allowed under the Constitution.  The Taoiseach should at least accept that if the people decide to vote &quot;No&quot;, there will be a need for a discussion on Seanad reform.  He has not said that, however.  He has said there will be no reform in the event of a &quot;No&quot; vote.  I think that is undemocratic.<\/p><p>  My real concern about this legislation relates to the whole area of democracy.  I have had an opportunity this week to read an interesting book I have had for the last five or six years, <i>Judging Dev<\/i> by Diarmaid Ferriter.  It takes us right back to the period when the Constitution was written.  The book focuses on a number of different aspects of that process, including the Seanad, of course.  Senator Keane said that speakers should not repeat themselves.<\/p><p>  During the debate on the compilation of the 1937 Constitution, there was a debate on the position of women.  I have always assumed that a subservient place was given to women in that Constitution against the wishes of a large number of women.  It turns out that a high proportion of people in Ireland wanted that constraint and control to be imposed on women in the Constitution.  I did not understand that.  I assumed it was pushed through and forced through.  In fact, it would appear that there was strong and substantial support for that measure.  I mention this as a reminder of how a Constitution can last 75 years in spite of the need for it to be reformed.<\/p><p>  We have been able to reform the position of women and other things in more recent years, but we have not reformed the Seanad even though we have had an opportunity to do so.  The 1979 referendum proposal was brought forward after it was accepted that there was a difficulty with not recognising the new colleges by allowing their graduates to vote in the same way as university graduates.  Although that proposal was accepted, none of the Governments we have had since then did anything about it.<\/p><p>  It is frustrating that Government spokespersons are suggesting that neither individual Senators nor the Seanad as a whole did anything about the need to reform this House.  We were not able to do anything about it.  I have been here for 20 years.  Senator Norris has been here for almost 30 years.  We have called for the reform of the Seanad, but the power to provide for such reform has not been in our hands.  It has been in the hands of various Governments.  We have not had a chance to reform the House.<\/p><p>  When we look back on the events of 1937, we should reflect on how various aspects of the Constitution have influenced this country over the years.<\/p> <p>The word \"neutrality\" did not feature in the 1937 Constitution, yet it was pursued as a policy.<\/p><p>The decision not to establish a replica or duplicate of the Lower House was considered.  Having the various panels elected by elected representatives is not undemocratic, although it could be argued that the five panels are no longer representative.  If one were establishing panels now, one would probably have the disability sector and other groups represented.  The Seanad is not in a position to change the panels, however.<\/p><p>I was pleased to support the Seanad reform Bill introduced by Senators Zappone and Crown.  Senators recognise the need for reform.  For the Government to turn its back on reform and choose abolition is wrong.  If we choose not to delay the Bill for 90 days, we will not have an opportunity to consider the option of reform. <\/p><p>Reference is made to the Seanad 75 times in the Constitution.  The number of changes required were the Seanad to be abolished would devastate and tear apart the Constitution.  This issue had not been given sufficient thought.  When the Government was elected I was not enthusiastic about its idea of holding a constitutional convention because I did not understand its purpose.  The Constitutional Convention has earned its keep, however, as its chairman and members have shown great commitment and demonstrated that the convention is capable of doing a valuable job.  Despite earning the respect of citizens, we were not given an opportunity to put before the convention the greatest proposed change to the Constitution, namely, the abolition of the Seanad.  The Taoiseach and a small coterie of four Ministers have decided they will not allow the issue of Seanad abolition to be discussed at the Constitutional Convention, whereas issues such as voting age and the length of the President's term may be discussed.  I do not understand the reason the proposed abolition of this House may not be discussed, especially given the 75 references to the Seanad in the Constitution.  <\/p><p>The number of times the Seanad has amended Bills that have been passed in the other House demonstrates that the abolition of the Upper House would damage democracy.  According to the information we have received, approximately 450 amendments have been made in this House since the Government was formed two and a half years ago.  While some of them were introduced by the Government, a large number were introduced because Senators identified improvements to the Bills in question.  This would no longer be the case if we did not have a second Chamber.  <\/p><p>This Bill has not received sufficient attention.  Delaying it for 90 days would give citizens an opportunity to debate the legislation and ensure that, if they decide to vote in favour of abolishing they House, they will have at least done so having given the matter some thought.  Citizens are not being given this opportunity.  For this reason, I urge the Government to accept the amendment to ensure the proposal receives the attention it deserves. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300023#W00600","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374583800,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak.

The most honest contributions were made by Senators Mac Conghail and Hayden who stated openly they will vote \"No\" but allow the Bill to pass in order that people are given their say.  That is the nub of the issue.  The Government is seeking the support of the House to ask the people of this great constitutional Republic to finally determine its view on this issue.  After all of the reports and having excluded citizens from the Seanad for 75 years, we want to allow them to come to a view on the issue.<\/p><p>The reason we chose this route as opposed to asking the Constitutional Convention to examine the possibility of abolishing the Seanad was that we gave a commitment in the course of the previous general election.  This commitment was joined by Sinn F&eacute;in and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, both of which stated they would hold a referendum if they were in government.  That is the reason we did not ask the Constitutional Convention to examine the matter.  We are holding good on a commitment we gave to the Irish people during the election campaign of 2011.  <\/p><p>I reassure the House that, contrary to the views expressed by some Senators, this is not a power grab by either the Taoiseach, a select group of Ministers, the Government or anyone else.  These are not the last days of the Weimar Republic, as some would have us believe.  I heard outrageous claims being made about the Taoiseach, for example, when he was painted in some pitiful contributions as being somewhere between Robert Mugabe and Mussolini.  The Taoiseach is holding good on a commitment he made, which was subsequently included in the programme of Government.  This is a difficult decision for any Taoiseach to make because he must effectively tell 20% of his parliamentary party that he proposes to radically reduce the number of politicians in Leinster House.  He has shown enormous courage in holding good on the commitment he gave the Irish people.  It would have been easier for him to go down the reform route, ask the Constitutional Convention to examine the issue or find some weasel words to allow him to abandon his commitment.  Instead, he chose to honour it and in doing so, he has shown authority in circumstances where the country has gone through the mire and the political establishment, including me, the Senators present and the Deputies elected to the other House, must radically change the way in which we present politics.  In stating they believe it is possible to function with one House of Parliament, the Taoiseach and Government are making a public statement.  This is the proposition that will feature in the referendum campaign.  I agree with colleagues that the sooner the campaign commences, the better.  It will be for the people to decide whether they want a unicameral or bicameral Parliament.  To present this proposal as some form of power grab or the decision of a dictatorial cabal consisting of the four Ministers who make up the economic management council is childish nonsense.  <\/p><p>This is a radical move for which the Government does not make any apologies.  Politics must radically change if we are to ensure the crisis that befell this country does not happen again. <\/p> <p>We think we can do that with one parliament, but that requires radical change.  We do not suggest the abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann alone will be the catalyst for that change.  There is a host of things we need to do.  To be honest, the winning of this campaign by the Government which is committed to holding this referendum will prove to the people that we can reform D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and that it can be the place where the required radical change and shake-up of politics takes place.  That will be the campaign.<\/p><p>I respect utterly the fact that colleagues in my party will vote &quot;No&quot; in the campaign.  I suspect the majority of Senators in front of me will vote &quot;No&quot;.  Equally, I respect those colleagues who are backing the Bill and allowing the people to come to a view.  I respect the fact that they are willing to put this issue before them.  We should not forget the fact that under the Constitution, it is the people who are sovereign.  It will not be some group of parliamentarians whose career plans may be upset but the people who will decide this issue.  They are sovereign and they will change the Constitution or choose not to amend it.  I will live or die by that decision.<\/p><p>What the Government is doing in holding the referendum is asking the people to decide.  It is asking the one group whose view on this issue has been singularly ignored in the past 75 years.  It is not asking some elite or group that has been given a vote because it happens to have a university education, nor is it asking some group of politicians.  No, it is the people who will be asked for their view on this issue and the Government will accept that view.<\/p><p>Senator Diarmuid Wilson made a charge that I am obliged to rebut.

Very few Senators have referred to the substance of the point made by Senator Sean D. Barrett in the amendment, including the Senator himself.  The suggestion made by him is that when it gets to the point of establishment of a new D&aacute;il, a further 90 days after the reassembly of the next D&aacute;il, a new Government could decide whether it wished to abolish the Seanad.  That is undemocratic and flies in the face of the referendum which I hope will take place.  Effectively, the Senator is trying to second guess the will of the people in this matter.  As I said, this is an issue for them decide, not the Senator, any group of us, the Executive or any part of it.  This is an issue for the people to determine.  Therefore, we will not accept the amendment.  It would effectively kick off the issue again and second guess the express wish of the people.  <\/p><p>As I said during the course of my contribution to the debate, the net issue is whether we require a one House or two House system.  That is the issue for debate in the next couple of months, leading up to the referendum in the autumn.  It is the task of the Government and those who support us on this proposition to promote the reforms we will make.  I accept that there is legitimate scepticism about the scale of these reforms and how they will deliver the kind of political system we need.  That is why this debate needs to be about the pre-legislative and the pre and post-enactment stages we propose, which I set out in my Second Stage contribution.<\/p><p>I found the mention of the Constitutional Convention very interesting.  I have read in detail the remarks made by Senators on all sides of the House about the convention.  The majority of them opposed the establishment of the convention and refused to have a debate in the House on it.  They filibustered on that issue, as they have on this.  However, everyone is now speaking in defence of the convention.  What hypocrisy.  The convention was designed by the Government and initiated by both Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  It has happened under the Government, yet the allegation is that this is some sort of power grab.  What utter rubbish.  Look at the record.  When this issue was debated in the House, the T&aacute;naiste could not get an opportunity to speak because of the filibustering that occurred on that occasion.  That is the record, as against the hypocrisy I have heard in the past three weeks from some Senators.  Therefore, the so-called Constitutional Convention-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300025#Y01600","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1374584400,"counter":289,"content":"<p>It is the so-called convention now, is it?

We stand over this.<\/p><p>Senator Sean D. Barrett made a number of claims on which I ask him to reflect, in particular his remarks on Northern Ireland.  Like Senator Terry Leyden, he is not over the Constitution.  Clearly, he has not read it or refuses to understand the bits of it that do not suit him.  I refer him to Article 47.3 which states: &quot;Every citizen who has the right to vote at an election for members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall have the right to vote at a Referendum&quot;.  Therefore, the question does not arise in regard to Northern Ireland for the reason that only those who can vote in a D&aacute;il election will have a vote when it comes to the holding of a constitutional referendum.  If someone is living in Northern Ireland and not registered to vote in a D&aacute;il election, he or she does not have a vote in a referendum.  Therefore, the proposition outlined by the Senator is constitutionally suspect to say the least. <\/p><p>The second issue relates to voters who have a vote in the university constituency.  Those people in Northern Ireland who have a vote have it because they are graduates of the universities.  What about the rest of the people living in Northern Ireland who are Irish citizens and part of the Irish nation?  Are they to be excluded?  Are they children of a lesser god when it comes to the less than 40% who turn out to vote for the university Senators?  The Government has a different view.  It believes people who live in the Republic should vote on this issue.  The question does not arise in regard to Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland because they are not entitled to vote in a D&aacute;il election.  This is not about one category of voter and their entitlement to vote.  The issue is whether this republic needs a one-House or two-House parliament.  That is the issue that will be debated in the course of the campaign.<\/p><p>The issue of the public information campaign was raised by Senator David Norris, but I want to rebut his suggestion.  The Government will not be running a publicly funded Government information campaign.  The suggestion is that in some way Government funds will be used for the purpose of winning this campaign.<\/p> <p>Political parties will spend money on this campaign in the normal way and will account for that in the normal way.  A referendum commission is being established and a sum of &euro;2.1 million is being set aside for the purposes of that campaign in an independent way, as has been the case in recent referendums in a very honest transparent way.<\/p><p>Senator Norris is confusing a number of issues, which I hope to explain to him now.  On the ballot paper, we will have a very clear reference to the proposed abolition referendum.  The statement for the information of voters will be sent to all homes and will make it clear that we are talking about the abolition of the Seanad.  There will be an information campaign conducted by the referendum commission, which is an independent body that will set out the arguments and encourage people to vote and take part in the process.  The commission has been established.  There has been much criticism of previous government decisions for the late establishment of commissions and the like.  In this case, the commission is being established and is getting ready for its work in informing voters.<\/p><p>As a Minister of State of the Government, I have always enjoyed coming to this House.  I have always found the debate to be of use to me as a Minister of State.  Although Senator Barrett ignored it during his contribution last week, on two separate occasions I overruled the advice of my officials and took his Bills.  I am not so sure I will do it in the future, given his remarks to me already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300025#Y02000","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374585000,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I think the Minister of State should withdraw that remark.

We sent the material to Brussels last week.  I will be joining with him because we need anything that can be done to get the banking sector in the way we both want it.  I am glad he appreciated the contribution of this House.  That is the spirit in which we came here two years ago.  He came in as a reforming Minister of State.  We were all here to help and I am afraid this is an issue which has poisoned the atmosphere around here, and I regret that.  I look forward to the restoration of the kind of relationships that he described there.<\/p><p>  It is a tribute to this House that the Government wants collectively get rid of us and the Title of the Bill contains the words &quot;Abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann&quot;.  There should be natural tensions.  Checks and balances require that.  If we were such a teddy bear that nobody in the Cabinet ever noticed us and we were drawing pay and doing nothing, that would be a far more serious situation.  These checks and balances are absolutely necessary in my view and that is why I will be arguing the opposite case to the Minister of State when this goes to the public.  It is regrettable that we did not have a Green Paper, a White Paper or an impact assessment.  Some of the things that have happened in recent days have weakened the reform cause that the Minister of State and I share.  I think the inquiries Bill proposed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, which was before this House last Friday, was seriously undermined by the fact that the strong impression given beforehand was that the committees are in some way in the gift of the Government.  Deputy Peter Mathews, who knows much about finance, and other Deputies who knew about medicine, as pointed out by Senator Crown, were removed from it.  If committees are to replace this House, they must have credibility.  We are already in trouble with the Abbeylara judgment, and I suspect that what will happen in committees will damage us and weaken the possibility of reforming banking, which is what we all want to do.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State spoke about reforms.  Nothing in this Senate prevents the reform of the D&aacute;il.  I mentioned last week that the Ceann Comhairle should be chosen by secret ballot.  Government Senators should be allowed to put down amendments.  They may be required to vote, but it would enhance the debate here.  There should be far more freedom from the Whip than has been the case heretofore.  The Minister of State has heard people say that they are going to vote &quot;No&quot;, but will vote &quot;Yes&quot; today.  It is like a problem that we encountered when we were trying to change the economy and there were absolute prohibitions on international trade.  We gradually reduced them by 5% and 10%.  Could we start with 5% of Whip free days or Bills and gradually increase that freedom?<\/p><p>  Senator Crown has proposed that we should make the pledge to Ireland and its Constitution.  It is rather strange to see people voting one way because they made a pledge to a political party.  The Constitution stands above that.  We could go further down the reform route and the Minister of State will not find many obstacles to that reform in here.  However, it is rather blunt to abolish the 60 people in here as part of that reform programme.  There could be other elements in the reform programme as well.<\/p><p>  I have SI 563 of 2012 in front of me, signed by Deputy Simon Coveney and Deputy Michael Noonan, who gave the official seal.  It allocated on 12 December 2012 the sum of &euro;841, 771,713 to the horses and dogs sectors, 80% of which went for horses and 20% for dogs.  Savings on this House of Parliament might come to &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million and then the Government allocates over &euro;841 million on 12 December by a statutory instrument which is not even discussed here, because that is part of the flaws in our system as Europe and the statutory instruments do not get discussed.<\/p><p>  Some of the costings which make up the &euro;20 million figure struck me as bizarre.  This is in respect of a statement to <i>The Irish Times <\/i>that the &euro;20.1 million figure is not exaggerated.  We find that each Senator makes &euro;32,000 worth of telephone calls and that the Bills Office cost &euro;47,000 per Senator.  Most Senators do not put down any amendments or never run Bills.  Those of us who do run Bills, including those that the Minister of State likes, must cost the State an absolute fortune, if we are to judge them by the costings that make up the &euro;20.1 million figure.  Indirect costs are allocated at &euro;155,000 per Senator, compared to a &euro;65,000 basic salary.  It just seems that there is an attempt to throw everything, including the kitchen sink, on top of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300026#Z00600","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1374585000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Cleaning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300026#Z00700","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1374585000,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I note Muiris MacC&aacute;rthaigh's article in yesterday's edition of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, entitled &quot;Executive accountability in the D&aacute;il still elephant in the room&quot;.

I will be sorry to see our constituency abolished if this is passed.  The people whom I admire most from the past are David Plunkett and John Ball, the two TCD MPs in Westminster who, on 12 March 1873, voted against Gladstone's Irish Universities Bill which would have absorbed Queen's University into Trinity, run down Cork and closed Galway as uneconomic.  Those two voted out Gladstone's government and voted Disraeli in.  They had the courage of their convictions.  We have always been like that, right up to the modern era, for example, Skeffington arguing against the ill-treatment of children when that was the norm, Mary Robinson favouring human rights long before that was the norm and Trevor West's stand on anti-sectarianism North and South.  That is a proud record  and I will defend it.  I agree with the speaker - I think it was Senator Quinn - who said that if we ever do discuss reform, we cannot really expect to end up with a Seanad that is the same as the D&aacute;il.  That is not the purpose of the Seanad.

It is certainly far superior to any of the committees, quangos and bodies on which Taoisigh, including John Bruton and others up to the previous Government, asked me to serve.  I agree with Senator van Turnhout that we need to do more on legislation.  The Taoiseach should come in here more often.  I do not want to make any melodrama out of that.<\/p><p>  D&aacute;il reform is needed.  I have spoken about the Whip system.  We need the diverse voices because group-think got us into the mess that we all, the Minister of State, I and everybody here, are trying to correct.  We need more diverse voices, more elected people.  When we consider the disasters from 2008 to now, the political part was solved, our Fianna F&aacute;il friends are 58 Deputies lighter as a result.  The other parts have not been solved and they will be pleased because there will be a much smaller Oireachtas without the Seanad to call them to account.  The people have solved the political bit and I hope that it will be solved by the people the right way around on this occasion.<\/p><p>  Senator Noone mentioned the media.  The media has turned in our favour in the recent past.  The longer this discussion goes on, the more the media sees a role for this House.  People said that not one Government Senator is in favour of this.<\/p><p>  Senator Wilson referred to tinkering with the Constitution.  My research assistant tells me this will change the Constitution and its schedules in 96 places.  That is virtually writing a new constitution.  I would like the literature given to people to include a remark to the effect that the Constitution will be altered in 96 places if this goes through.  We do need transitional arrangements and I will come to those in a second.  The people will decide but I have been in court cases for the citizen versus the State and the State holds all the aces.  That is the fear people on our side have.  I appreciate the Minister of State's assurance that it may not in this particular case.<\/p><p>  I have to stick to the point about Northern Ireland being neglected.  Indeed, the Minister of State mentioned it in his response.  We will be using a D&aacute;il electoral register to abolish the Seanad which has a different electoral register, the main difference being Northern Ireland, as the Minister of State said.  Those voters are being put out of the Oireachtas by a referendum in which they have no say.  That is the point I am sticking to.  The Minister of State cannot give votes to my constituents in Northern Ireland because the Constitution does not allow it.  If the Minister of State, and the Government, get their way they will no longer have any say in this House. <\/p><p>  There is a most interesting article in the current issue of <i>The Church of Ireland Gazette<\/i> by Martin Mansergh, a distinguished former Member of this House.  He feels that the way the two parts of Ireland relate to each other has been going wrong for a long time not least because the Parliament in Northern Ireland was already in session in the June before the talks took place in November and December to sign the Treaty.  He feels that the Home Rule solution and more accommodation between the two sides would have been a better way to run things.  He has always been a voice for reconciliation and was a major voice in the peace process.  In his book <i>The Legacy of History<\/i> Dr. Mansergh says that we have lacked the generosity needed for the two parts of Ireland to talk to and relate to one another.  They do it with me but that is a historical accident.  I can draw bigger numbers at a meeting in Enniskillen and the first one I held after being elected was in Belfast.  That is a historical accident.  These people are scorned in the documentation the Minister of State has cited.  Dr. Mansergh quotes the manifesto of the Belfast Whigs in 1790:<blockquote>That the Protestant Dissenters, fully convinced of the constitutional principles of their brethren, the Roman Catholics, and of their zeal to support and defend the Liberty of their country will on all occasions support their just claim to the enjoyment of the rights and privileges of freeborn citizens entitled to fill every office and serve in whatever station their country may think proper to call them to.<\/blockquote>Martin Mansergh goes on to write:<blockquote>The generous tones of the 1780s and 1790s which in this country would have made an enormous impact in building confidence, harmony and reconciliation between the communities, have been conspicuous by their absence.<\/blockquote>I have no doubt that this will be felt North of the Border.<\/p><p>  James Madison, the fourth American President, one of the framers of the American Constitution, said that the founding fathers did not intend the United States Government to be partisan, the question is how to incorporate in a republic people who differ from us.  That is what Arthur Griffith did when the Provost of TCD and others approached him.  The undertakings were specified in a letter written to Arthur Griffith by Lloyd George.  That is what Arthur Griffith agreed to.  That spirit may be evident at the meeting of Young Fine Gael at the weekend.  On page 75 of his book, Donal O'Sullivan writes that they argued that there should be Senate.  Griffith said he was in favour of a second chamber and believed his colleagues would be.  The purpose was to provide safeguards for the representation of minorities and the general protection of their interests.  The TCD seats have done that.  The need for that is still felt.  That is why there are people demonstrating against the PSNI and the Parades Commission.  Two of the Northern Ireland parties will campaign against the Government on this issue.<\/p><p>  The Church of Ireland notes in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> on 13 July 2013 about the commemorations state: &quot;These are valuable initiatives for they provide a voice for the small minority which is the Church of Ireland - a community which has something significant to say but whose voice could be so easily overwhelmed by the national scale of commemoration&quot;.<\/p> <p>These valuable initiatives provide a voice for a small minority, the Church of Ireland - a community which has something significant to say but whose voice can be so easily overwhelmed by the national scale of commemoration.  I refer to the Steve McDonagh book about Barack Obama's Irish connection, which documents the decline in the Protestant population in the Republic from more than 10% in 1900 to around 3% now.  The goals of Arthur Griffith and company have not been realised.  We need a voice for all of the different strata of Irish society.  The book refers to such elements of unhappy history as the Mayo librarian controversy; an incident in which a Galway obstetrician, a graduate of TCD, was forced to surrender his appointment as professor of gynaecology at UCG and had to emigrate; the Fethard-on-Sea boycott - I remember my father going there on business to break that boycott; the TCD ban, which was in place right up to the 1970s; the threat to small rural Church of Ireland schools and the threat to the fee-paying schools of the Church of Ireland; and the treatment of the Church of Ireland College of Education and TCD itself.  Now the seats here in this Parliament are to be abolished.  That is very regrettable and a very sad occasion for those who believe in an Ireland of inclusiveness, as we all do.<\/p><p> Let me quote from Gordon Wilson when he spoke at the New Ireland Forum.  He was one of the great Senators.<blockquote>My being here stems from my love of this land and of its people but also from convictions nurtured from earliest days and sharpened by personal sufferings through the conflicts of the past years.  I am no mere Northerner but one whose heritage, religiously, socially and culturally, has been woven into my being, the person I am.  I am no foreigner in an alien land but in a land due to me and mine.<\/blockquote>I strongly agree with Gordon Wilson's comments.<\/p><p> I clarify that I am against the abolition of the Seanad.  I will be voting against the Bill today in the interests of consistency, because, unlike some of our colleagues, I see emblazoned in large type, &quot;Abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300027#AA00700","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374586200,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Exactly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300028#BB00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1374586200,"counter":310,"content":"<p>It is not a vote for anything else.  It has been very helpfully included by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, for which I thank it.<\/p><p>It is a principle of republican government - as in the United States - that structures are needed to exist to prevent the tyranny of the majority.  That is what we are getting now.  The Seanad was a beacon in preventing two sectarian states in Ireland.  It is a task that becomes no less urgent now than it ever was in the past.  <\/p><p>The 90-day delay is the normal time period allowed between the Seanad and D&aacute;il elections.  It allows time for reflection.  The constitutional changes are profound - 96 changes, according to some calculations, and 75 according to other calculations.  This is no small alteration to the Constitution.  The issue cannot be covered by the Constitutional Convention.  I have vague memories of the debate the Minister of State describes.  All I can plead is that I had been here as a Member for only around two weeks at that time and I was not familiar with the procedure.  Senator Quinn and I went to see the Taoiseach.  I am of the same view as the Americans, that the Constitution should not be changed very frequently.  My goal is to go to the Seanad and to make it work.  We also offered the Taoiseach some advice on the use of the electoral register as a way of ensuring that the real people were included.  We actually mentioned to him that people from Belmullet would have a say and not just everybody from the same quangos in Dublin 4.  The Bill to use the electoral register for the first time for that purpose was introduced in this House.  My aim was to assist the Government and to make this House work.  What is before the people is not an amendment of the 1937 Constitution.  The proposal will fundamentally change how the business of government is performed.  All these checks and balances provided by Senator Quinn, Senator Crown and all the Senators here will be gone.  There will be a rigid whip system which must be obeyed, or else one cannot sit on a committee or one will be fired out of one's office or subjected to some other form of torture, because people made a pledge not to the country nor to the Constitution but to a political party.  I am glad I was never a member of a political party when I hear some of those things.  It seems to be an awful situation into which people lock themselves.<\/p><p>Governments certainly take time to reflect on referendum results.  They have been reflecting on the referendum on university representation since 1979.  They did not get rid of the existing university seats at midnight before the D&aacute;il reconvened.  In the case of referendums on Europe, it seems that if the result is not liked, the referendum can be run again.  We have done that a couple of times.  The fact that a new Government might like to reflect on the gravity of what is proposed in the Government's Bill is very well worth considering.  It may even be the secret reason that amendment No. 28 survived and the other 77 were turfed out.  Some amendments were proposed by 20 Senators, and they cannot all be wrong.  Senators Zappone and Mary Ann O'Brien have four pages of amendments.  I am speaking on their behalf by default.  We could have had a far different discussion.  It devolved to me because 28 is a nicer number than any other number between zero and 78.<\/p><p>This legislation is wrong.  I respect the Minister of State, as always, but I do not think it illustrates political courage.  It is foolhardy to tear in like this.  More scrutiny is exhibited in these islands with the success of the new parliaments in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.  Unless we change other aspects of our political system, getting rid of the Seanad will be a fatal blow to Irish democracy.  Political parties should reflect on the way in which they have behaved towards dissidents in the recent past.  The Seanad was the home of dissident views.  That is why Arthur Griffith put it here.  I wonder how a distinguished Member in the Gallery, Deputy Peter Mathews, feels about how the new system will treat dissidents.<\/p><p>I am very much cheered up by the vote of Young Fine Gael.  I have found that young people like this House.  I checked the debating list in college the other evening.  Trinity College regularly debates and defeats Harvard, Yale, Oxford and Cambridge.  When Senator David Norris and myself shuffle off, there will be much better debaters coming up.  We are not even Old Testament prophets for the kind of people that are coming along the way.  One of the Senators on the Government side asked me to find a research assistant.  Seven candidates were identified and they all had brilliant degrees, including two candidates who had obtained 600 points in the leaving certificate examination.  These brilliant people want to serve in this House.  They are perhaps not as cynical as the Government in proposing to get rid of 60 politicians because they might have 60 far better people in mind.<\/p><p>It will be a turning point in the history of this country if this Bill goes through today and if this House is abolished.  We will be turning our backs on Northern Ireland and turning our backs on ideas.  We need ideas; they are not here.  There were no dissident voices when all the money was being spent.<\/p> <p>In 2002 I argued the case that Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly should oppose any proposal for the North to join the euro.  That was my contribution to the dissident voices on that issue.  There is too much groupthink in public discourse on a range of matters.  That is why the Seanad is needed.  When the Minister of State goes into the ballot box in Tallaght or Terenure, I hope he will think of us.<\/p><p> I referred on the first day of the debate to the observation by John Kells Ingram that might will sometimes conquer right.  That is what I fear will happen in this case.  The last poem Ingram wrote before his death seems suited to the situation in which we find ourselves:<blockquote>Unhappy Erin, what a lot was thine!<br \/>Half-conquered by a greedy robber band;<br \/>Ill governed with now lax, now ruthless hand;<br \/>Misled by zealots, wresting laws divine<br \/>To sanction every dark or mad design;<br \/>Lured by false lights of pseudo-patriot league<br \/>Through crooked paths of faction and intrigue;<br \/>And drugged with selfish flattery's poisoned wine.<br \/>Yet, reading all they mournful history,<br \/>Thy children with a mystic faith sublime,<br \/>Turn to the future, confident that Fate,<br \/>Become at last thy friend, reserves for thee,<br \/>To be thy portion in the coming time,<br \/>They know not what -- but surely something great.<\/blockquote>The Seanad can be something great.  A great Upper House can assist the Government in bringing forward the necessary reforms we all support.  I ask everybody here to support the amendment and to vote &quot;No&quot; in the referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300028#BB00300","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374586800,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Bravo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300029#CC00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1374586800,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an cheist: &quot;Go bhfanfaidh na focail a thairgtear a scriosadh.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"vote","time":1374586800,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the words proposed to be deleted stand.\"<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 31; N\u00edl, 24.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden; N\u00edl, Senators Sean D.

I have never known anything like that previously.  Let the people of Ireland beware: if this is what happens when there are two Houses, then God help Ireland if the Government manages to get rid of this House.  I rely, as I always have done, on the good sense of the people of Ireland.  I believe they will perceive that they have an open goal.  The Government, very cleverly and strategically, may have placed the referendum before the budget, because this will be one hell of a budget.  This will be a savage budget and nothing the Government proposes would be passed thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300032#FF00900","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1374587700,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Senator, we are on Fifth Stage of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300032#FF01000","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374587700,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Consequently, the Government's sleight of hand, dishonesty, manipulation, Machiavellian conniving and use of corruption - in every sense of the word - will backfire on it.

I believe this is a House that needs to be reformed.  If there were no option but to keep it as it is or abolish it, I probably would reluctantly vote for abolition, but I believe there is the prospect of reform.  Putting my money where my mouth is, I, together with Senators Quinn and Zappone, authored Bills which are aimed specifically at reform.  I am grateful to the leadership of the House for allowing our Bill to proceed to the Stage it has so that we can with a clean conscience campaign for a &quot;No&quot; vote in the referendum, stating that there is an option.  If we win, if the Seanad is retained, there is significant moral pressure on the Government to consider the Bills to reform the Seanad.<\/p><p>  It is a rather breathtaking piece of historical revisionism to blame the Seanad for failing to reform itself over all the years.  Certainly, I was not in the Seanad.  The Taoiseach, who has been the primary <i>auteur<\/i> of the move to end the existence of the Seanad, has had a long and distinguished career in Leinster House and I have not noticed many initiatives from him over the years to reform the Seanad.<\/p><p>  In summary, my opposition stems around a few facts.  First, as someone who has screamed and roared for increased funding to be made available for the health service and other parts of the social system, I can say that the figures that were trumpeted as the potential savings associated with abolition have been shown to be wrong and have, in fact, been partly retracted by others in the Government.  I would go further.  I believe the saving will be zero.  I believe there will be no moneys redeployed to the health service.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, the man who is responsible for saving money in the public service, in this Chamber in 2011, again on RTE and more recently in a private conversation with me, which he gave me gracious permission to quote in public, has told us that the moneys saved from the Seanad would be redeployed to D&aacute;il committees.<\/p><p>  There is undoubtedly a democratic deficit in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  The democratic deficit, collectively, in Leinster House, will be larger - it will be further in the red - if the currently quasi-democratic Seanad is replaced by a wholly undemocratic politburo of experts appointed by the Taoiseach.  With respect to the Taoiseach, he has shown himself in recent weeks to be not immune to the idea of using appointments which should be technical - the very kind of appointment he stated he would make for the oversight of our legislation - in removing Deputies Mathews and Denis Naughten from committees in which they had technical expertise, for reasons which had nothing whatsoever to do with their competence in the committees-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300033#GG01400","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1374588300,"counter":416,"content":"<p>Exactly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300033#GG01500","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1374588300,"counter":417,"content":"<p>-----because he wanted to make a political point and, with respect, to introduce a little cronyism.

I will not use the analogy I used previously, but the Taoiseach, in his inaugural speech for a Seanad abolition campaign, stated that the Seanad was somehow - I am still trying to work this one out - at fault for inflating the Celtic tiger.  That is a little like God blaming Met &Eacute;ireann for the great flood.  The reality is that the Taoiseach, who was then leader of the Opposition and was sitting in Leinster House, did exactly nothing to deflate the bubble.  I am not saying he was primarily responsible.

There is no fear whatsoever of asking the people a question - indeed, we should do so more often on a wide variety of issues - but it is dishonest not to ask the people whether they would prefer reform or abolition, because one must ask what comes next.  As Senator Norris stated, No. 2, which is to be taken without debate, simply states that the Oireachtas will constitute the President and the D&aacute;il.  As for who controls the D&aacute;il, as we have seen, with an iron hand, the Taoiseach does, and nobody else.  I refer to Deputy Mathews and Senators Heffernan and Healy Eames, whose contributions are based purely on their loyalty, as it were, to the Crown.<\/p> <p>That is fundamentally wrong.  It is relevant to ask when the McKenna judgment will become relevant.  Clearly, considerable resources of the State have been used in the promotion of abolishing what the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, in directing the Government's campaign, called the rigged situation that guaranteed that the Government succeeded.  The records in Highland Radio can give the House the exact wording.  They are the words of a man who could not tell us how many times his Government had amended legislation in the House in the past 12 months.  When I made it easier for him by asking him how many times he had amended his own legislation in the House, I was met with silence.<\/p><p> There are probably thousands of very good reasons to abolish the Seanad, the D&aacute;il, the Judiciary, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and countless other organisations, as there are very good ones to reform or constantly improve them.  It is not valid to blame the excesses of the Celtic tiger on the Seanad, as Senator John Crown said. <\/p><p> I used a word often associated with people who juggle in circus rings and I do not intend to use it today.  Is it any wonder that I used such a term when somebody of such intelligence and with 37 years of proud public service in the Houses of the Oireachtas since 1976 could regard this House as rigged to ensure the Government would have absolute control?  The Minister admitted this in directing the campaign for the Government.  He implied that this House had done nothing to quell the excesses of the Celtic tiger era.  We could debate that issue for years and talk about the abolition of stamp duty, etc.<\/p><p> I am aware that the debate on the Bill is to be guillotined at 4 p.m. and I am anxious that some of my democratic colleagues be allowed to say a few words.

As Senator Quinn would agree, this is a radically different Bill from the original.  I agree with Senator Norris that it has taken too long.  One reason for taking more time than expected was that this was the first legislation in respect of which a regulatory impact assessment, RIA, was conducted.  All of the partners in the industry were involved in trying to tease out the problems with the Bill, which we managed to do in the course of the deliberations in the Lower House.  The length of time taken was not for lack of trying on my part.<\/p><p>This important amendment is concerned with certainty about payment for the small guy, as it were.  Mining and exploration do not fall within that definition, for which reason we have excluded them.  I would have hoped to be in a position to return the Bill before now.  I am sorry it was not done in that way.<\/p><p>The second grouping relates to amendments Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive.  The main element relates to issues raised in the context of the consultation process that formed a part of the Bill's RIA.  The RIA examined the experience of adjudication in other jurisdictions and found that, in the majority of disputes that used such processes, contracts were valued at between &euro;13,000 and &euro;65,000.<\/p> <p>Therefore, the RIAI concluded that these thresholds were too high and should be reviewed or removed.  The amendments included on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il removed the current thresholds from &euro;200,000 for private contracts and &euro;50,000 for public contracts and replaced them with a single threshold of &euro;10,000.  That issue came from the regulatory impact assessment, and Senator Quinn was supportive of what we had to do in bringing back those thresholds to the minimum &euro;10,000 level.<\/p><p>In this regard, I note there has been some confusion about to what the threshold applies.  The new threshold of &euro;10,000 relates to the overall contract value, and therefore subcontractors will be free to refer payment disputes relating to lesser amounts to adjudication.  For example, if a contract with an overall value of &euro;11,000 gives rise to a payment dispute for &euro;1,000, this will come within the scope of the legislation.  The reason thresholds were included in the Bill was to avoid placing undue administrative burden arising from financial security provisions in an earlier form of the Bill.  As there is evidence that obtaining such financial instruments would be prohibitively costly for the sector, these security provisions were removed from the Bill in the Seanad.  The removal of the financial security provisions made it possible to reduce the monetary thresholds.  It is important to note the threshold relates to the size of the overall contract; therefore, subcontractors will be free to refer payment disputes relating to lesser amounts to adjudication.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 3 is a technical amendment as a consequence of amendments Nos. 4 and 5, which relate to the removal of the two different thresholds that apply to State contracting or private entities.  Since the new threshold of &euro;10,000 now applies equally to public and private entities, the definition of a State contracting entity under section 1 is no longer necessary and, as such, has been removed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300037#MM01400","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374591000,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  With regard to payments under contracts, payments claims notices and who is entitled to claim, what is included in the Bill?  In the previous section of the Bill there is reference to the exclusion of materials, plant and machinery, but in this section it is indicated that construction contracts shall provide for what is not included in the other section.  I know of a subcontractor who had all his plant and machinery stolen and taken to Dubai under a construction contract.  He is a very good subcontractor and worked here on the M50.  The machinery was taken to Dubai by the main contractor and the subcontractor did not realise this was happening.  When he got out to Dubai to do the work, he found out he did not own the machinery, and &euro;1.5 million of his plant and machinery had been taken from Ireland to Dubai.  Does this Bill include something that would help that subcontractor?  It happened a couple of years ago so the action would have to be retrospective.<\/p><p>What happens if the contractor applies for a State contract, as dealt with by other sections of the Bill?

We are only responsible for legislation enacted from this day forth.  Needless to say, the issue referred to by the Senator is straightforward theft, and if somebody has taken plant and machinery from a contractor or subcontractor, the appropriate sanction would have to be brought through the Garda or other international agencies.<\/p><p>The Senator raises a very important issue, with which the Government is grappling, of how we can ensure that those who win contracts are effectively people who have a good standing within the construction industry and comply with employment and other health and safety legislation that is in place.  It is a very important point.  The Government is currently working on a proposal to introduce what is called a statutory register, whereby construction contractors who are fully compliant in all legislation that goes through these Houses would be put on a register, and it would be a matter for public authorities to utilise those.  We do not have recourse to that at the moment, which is a major problem.  One of the more recent analyses of the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, which considers these issues, has shown a significant problem of non-compliance in the construction industry.  That is not only non-compliance in terms of legislation, and this Bill will deal with the real problem of payment.<\/p><p>Considering the construction industry as a whole, there are not enough contracts in place, and we hope that as a result of Senator Quinn's Bill there will be a standard upon which the industry can go forward.  As part of the new armoury we are obtaining under the Bill, we must also have a regulatory statutory instrument to ensure that cowboys will be clearly and demonstrably outside the loop.

Section 3(5) excludes the practice of \"pay when paid\" clauses in construction contracts; this is a key provision of the legislation.  There is a concern that the wording of section 3(5) in the Bill passed by the Seanad, particularly the phrase \"an act of\", may give rise to a challenge to the practice of certification of payment, which is a key provision in many contracts between a building commissioner and a main contractor and is provided for in section 3(1).  Typically, payments under a construction contract between the project commissioner and the main contractor are conditional upon a certificate of payment being issued by the named certifier under the contract.  If section 3(5) is not amended, it may give rise to a challenge to any payment where the payment application made by the contractor was reduced by the certifier in line with the terms of the contract.  This amendment brings clarity to the practice of certification of payments under a construction contract without diminishing the key intent of section 5(5), which is to outlaw the inclusion of \"pay when paid\" clauses in construction contracts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300038#NN00800","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1374591000,"counter":499,"content":"<p>This sounds suspiciously similar to mining contracts, and I am very disturbed that the Minister of State has indicated that mining has been excluded from this.

Everyone accepted this as fact.  The provisions were amended to provide for suspension of work following seven days' notification in writing.  This suspension can continue until referral of the payment dispute for adjudication, and following an adjudicator's award where the award has not been paid.  The amendment provides for a more balanced solution that, while not prejudging the outcome of a payment dispute, allows this issue to be resolved.<\/p><p>  There is universal agreement that what we have done in this context has dealt with one of the key issues raised by subcontractors in the course of the regulatory impact assessment - that is, allowing people to return to work while the dispute is being resolved.  This was not the case in the original draft and is a significant improvement.<\/p><p>  The fifth grouping comprises amendments 9 to 11, inclusive.  These are technical amendments to remove the provision in section 6(2) that is already provided for in section 2(5)(<i>b<\/i>), which reads:<blockquote>This Act applies to a construction contract whether or not-- [...](<i>b<\/i>) the parties to the construction contract purport to limit or exclude its application.<\/blockquote>This was mistakenly repeated in section 6(5).<\/p><p>  Regarding amendments Nos. 10 and 11, at the start of Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, I mentioned the helpful contributions of both main Opposition spokespersons, those from Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il, in respect of the RIA.  This was the first legislation on which a RIA was conducted.  I invited to those discussions both main Opposition spokespersons.  They were around the table with me and we listened to the industry's opinions.  I have attempted to take as broad an approach as possible.<\/p><p>  This consultation highlighted a number of matters relating to the Bill that required further consideration, chief among those being the provision that limited the effectiveness of the adjudication process by making the adjudicator's award binding, provided the award was not appealed.  This measure was included to provide protection to the State in the event of insolvency of the payee.<\/p><p>  During Second Stage, a number of Deputies asked to have the adjudicator's award made binding - that is, payable even if the award was appealed to arbitration.  I accepted these concerns.  The amendment before the Seanad is the response to those issues.  It means that adjudication will be binding and will apply equally to private and State contracts.<\/p><p>  The adjudication provisions contained in the Bill are vital to its proper functioning.  In a sense, they give the legislation the necessary teeth to provide a swift and cost-effective means of dispute resolution.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 11 is required to remove section 7(3), which states that work may not be suspended if the adjudicator's award is not binding.  Since the non-binding aspect of the adjudicator's award has been removed in amendment No. 10, this subjection is no longer necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300039#OO00300","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1374591600,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and I understand his comment about retrospective application.

What happens if the dispute is about a payment, the theft of machinery or whatever, but a contract was not signed before the Bill was enacted?  It is a word of mouth contract so it is one person's word against another.  Can the wronged person - in this instance, the subcontractor - refer the matter to the adjudicator?  Can he or she do so particularly when payments have not been made to the bank for two years?  Is there any way the subcontractor can approach the adjudicator or persons in this instance?

I did not speak during tonight's debate as it is 1,168 days since the Bill commenced and, as we have spoken a lot about abolition or reform of the Seanad today, I felt that we should not speak any longer on the Bill than needed.<\/p><p>I wish to touch on some of the points that the Minister of State made.  He said that the Bill came about due to a small incident.  It was not a small incident but quite a substantial scandal whereby somebody who was not short of money had a company that did not pay its subcontractors.  This came to the attention of Se&aacute;n Gallagher, who wrote to a number of people, including his local Deputy, who circulated his letter.<\/p> <p>What struck me when I saw the letter was that it did not seem right that somebody who is clearly not short of money was worried about getting a sub-contractor to build his own home.  It was because he had let so many of them down.  What I then did was run with it.  I had the help of Ms Anne &Oacute; Broin, my executive assistant for 27 years, who grasped the issue and explored ways of finding a solution.  The British had introduced legislation in 1998, 15 years ago, and we were put in touch with Professor Rudi Klein, the expert who was actively involved in it.  He had already spoken with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, on a number of occasions and he came over and gave us advice.  Part of the advice he gave us was that the Bill enacted in Britain had had to be adjusted and some improvements had been made, particularly with regard to certain states of Australia, New Zealand and the Isle of Man.  He put us in touch with the relevant people, who were very helpful to us.  I always though the grocery business was fairly tough and rough, but what I have learned is that nothing compares to how tough the construction industry is.  There was great sympathy around the world for the fact that we did not have legislation, and we were offered support immediately.  I contacted the then Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, who demonstrated the same enthusiasm as the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, who has taken hold of it to make it work.  He left it in my hands to bring it through the Seanad.  The commitment of the late Brian Lenihan was such that, following the general election in which he was the only Fianna F&aacute;il Member who was re-elected in Dublin, and with a brief 12 hours before the election of the Taoiseach, he helped the Bill get through this House.  He was committed to this Bill.  <\/p><p>The objective was to have sensible law which would be easy to understand.  Senators Norris and Keane expressed concerns that the Bill does not cover everything.  The concept, after 1,168 days, was to make it as simple as we could.  The Bill became quite involved because we tried to achieve too much in it.  We have had some very good debates and different viewpoints have been expressed.  Not everything we set out to do has been achieved, including, in particular, ways of dealing with bespoke items - in other words, a thing that has been made especially for a particular job.  We would have liked to be able to include provision for bespoke items but we were not able to.  As the Minister of State explained, there were other aspects that could not be handled on this basis.  Under the law, if I sell a car to a person who does not pay me, I can go and collect the car from him, but if the customer does not pay for tiling or plumbing, those things are embedded in the building and the contractor cannot take them out.  We understood that this would make it difficult to deal with it in legislation.<\/p><p>What impressed me no end was the commitment from the Government to deal with the Bill.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, grasped the Bill and decided to run with it.  I commend the officials who dealt with the Bill, some of whom are not here now, including Nicholas O'Loughlin, who put his heart and soul into it, as did Deirdre Hanlon and Ronan O'Reilly, who is not present.  One of the officials who is sitting behind the Minister is David O'Brien, who was very helpful and committed to making the legislation work.  I am sure Anne &Oacute; Broin must have given them nightmares on occasion when she phoned them to find out what was happening.<\/p><p>I was able to pick up the phone to Arthur Cox at the beginning and was greatly helped by Patrick McGovern, Niav O'Higgins and Niamh Burke, who put their hearts and souls into getting the Bill off the ground at first.  In the Bills Office, Noreen Banim put her heart and soul into the effort as well. <\/p><p>Nothing would have happened if Se&aacute;n Gallagher had not contacted his local TD, who got in touch with me.  People also contacted me when they heard the Bill was being published and offered their help.  Tom Parlon, the former Minister, and Don O'Sullivan, who are in the Visitors' Gallery, put great effort into the legislation.  Everybody involved in the industry put so much effort into it, including Engineers Ireland, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, the Irish Concrete Federation - even though it did not get everything it would have liked out of it, particularly in respect of bespoke goods - and Hardware Association Ireland.  What has resulted is a Bill we are all pleased with.  People from right round the country have contacted me asking me to include certain provisions.  The Minister and his team were very responsive to the suggestions and people were understanding when we could not include them.  The Minister of State explained very well the issues of &quot;pay when paid&quot; clauses, bespoke items and the limits involved.<\/p><p>Will the Minister consider the possibility of a commitment from the Government to review the operation of the Act in two years time?  It might be possible to do something on that basis.  We believe the Bill is as good as we can get, but we could look again in time at dealing with disputes.  The number of disputes going to court in Britain have been reduced significantly from approximately 2,500 to some 5% of the total.  We have the door open and if a person is unhappy with the legislation he or she can go to court afterwards, but it takes time.  The subcontractor will have been paid on that basis.<\/p><p>I believe this House has proved its value here tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300039#OO01200","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374592200,"counter":514,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300040#PP00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1374592200,"counter":515,"content":"<p>The House gives an opportunity to Independent Members to introduce legislation on their own.

A large body of evidence supports the fact the foetus feels pain in the womb during a termination or abortion, particularly if the foetus is over 20 weeks.  Professor Glover, a pro-choice advocate in the United Kingdom, says this is the case from 17 weeks onwards.  My amendment requests that an anaesthetic be provided for the unborn at terminations at 16 weeks, provided there is no ill effect for the mother.<\/p><p>I have looked widely at research in this area.  In neonatal units in the United Kingdom, surgery on foetuses over 23 weeks is performed with the unborn child under anaesthetic.  It is medically accepted that unborn babies feel pain and some people argue that they feel pain from 17 weeks.  There have been several attempts to highlight this in the United Kingdom.  In 2008, a motion was put forward to reduce the abortion time limit to 20 weeks, on the basis of pain research on unborn children.  In the US, some 11 states now recommend an anaesthetic at the time of an abortion, because of the evidence on pain.  The evidence is so strong that last month the US Congress passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, limiting abortions to 20 weeks, due to the pain experienced by the unborn child during abortions of foetuses over 20 weeks.  The common ground on this issue is that where abortions are performed on any unborn child over 20 weeks, there is broad agreement on the experience of pain by the unborn.<\/p><p>As Members know, the situation here is that a termination is allowed, legally, up to birth.  I know the Minister has said that babies will be induced, but the Bill does not state that abortion cannot be carried out.  I was struck by evidence that in the later stages of pregnancy, the placenta thickens to protect the unborn child from maternal viruses, HIV, alcohol and other toxic substances.  In the process, it also protects the foetus against maternal anaesthesia.  Although the mother may be under anaesthetic, that anaesthesia does not pass on to the unborn in the later stages of pregnancy.  For this reason, since approximately 2000, a separate anaesthetic is given to the infant in perinatal surgery as it has been proven that infants feel pain quite intensely.<\/p><p>Can anybody here name one Senator or citizen who would deny an unborn baby an anaesthetic if its life must be ended, if that would give some relief to the unborn child?  I hope the Minister of State accepts this amendment.  We are trying to be humane.  It is a pity we have to go down this road, but if we do, let us end that life in as pain free and humane a manner as possible.  If an animal has to be put down, that is done in a pain free manner.  Let us not think a child's life is any less.<\/p><p>This is my request.  I have a large body of information on foetal pain.  I understand I will be able to come back on this, as I am the proposer of the motion.  Is that correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300043#SS01200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1374594300,"counter":563,"content":"<p>That is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300044#TT00100","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1374594300,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I will leave it at that, because I know others want to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300044#TT00200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1374594300,"counter":565,"content":"<p>From reports I have come across on foetal pain, it is happening earlier than the 24 weeks indicated by the Minister of State yesterday.  I would like to refer him to a report by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in England, which strongly recommends that women should routinely be offered pain relief during surgical operations.  It is part of their recommendations that this would be done.  I cannot find where it states that pain relief should be given to the baby, but from the information we have, which is medically underpinned, everything that Senator Healy Eames says is factual.  If we are even half interested in being humane, to me it would be a logical step that this would be done, especially given the fact that our abortion legislation is unique in that there are no effective time limits on it.  It behoves us as legislators at least to have that level of compassion and include in the Bill provisions that avoid foetal pain.<\/p><p>Former US President Ronald Reagan was the man who introduced abortion in 1967 in California, so he did not come to the subject without some knowledge and perhaps some regret for what he had done.  He later said that &quot;Medical science doctors confirm that when the lives of the unborn are snuffed out, they often feel pain, pain that is long and agonizing&quot;.  I support the amendment from Senator Healy Eames.  I do not think it requires any great pressing from our point of view.  Anybody who has a humane approach to this topic, even though we may have different perspectives on the substantive issue, would certainly not want the unborn baby to be suffering pain as a consequence of the procedure being carried out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300044#TT00300","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1374594300,"counter":566,"content":"<p>It is important to understand - many of us keep emphasising this - that this Bill is about the protection of life of the mother and the child.

Article 40.3.3o sets out quite clearly that the life of the mother and the life of the unborn must be protected at all times.  It is only when there is a risk to the life of the mother that certain procedures can be carried out in order to save the mother.  These proposals are unimplementable, are not feasible and that is the medical advice that I have received.   Therefore, under no circumstances can the proposals as set out here be accepted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300044#TT01700","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1374594300,"counter":580,"content":"<p>Senator Burke has given a very clear reason to oppose these amendments.  This reason comes from seeking advice from Irish consultants.  It is very important that we look at Irish medical practice.  We need to trust doctors in this country.  I was present in the Chamber yesterday when the Minister for Health gave a very full explanation as to why these particular amendments would not be accepted.  We had a very full debate on similar amendments on Committee Stage.  We did not get to a number of other amendments on Committee Stage that would be worth debating, and I hope we can do so.  The debate on this has really been gone over quite a number of times, and we have heard very clear reasons for opposing them.  It is unfortunate that the debate has been dominated by a small number of individuals and by quoting from US practice and US research.  We need to look more closely and focus on the Irish Constitution, which sets out the parameters within which we must legislate, and look also at Irish medical practice and trust our doctors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300044#TT01800","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1374594300,"counter":581,"content":"<p>I support the amendments, especially amendment No.9 which we are currently debating.  Senators are asking why we are quoting American and British consultants and not Irish consultants.  Part of the answer to that conundrum is the following.<\/p> <p>The Irish medical model, the two-patient model, has a very different idea of care from the one that will arise from the passing of this legislation.  We need therefore to look at the countries that are already down the road which we are now about to travel.  Britain and America are two countries which many years ago introduced what they felt at the time was exceptionally limited abortion, to be used in very few cases, yet we know that is not what transpired. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 9, in the names of Senators Healy Eames and Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien, states that the proposal would be implemented, &quot;provided this does not increase the risk of the loss of life of the pregnant woman&quot;.  That is a very plain statement providing for an anaesthetic where there is no increase in the risk of the loss of life of the pregnant woman.  The Minister debated this with us at some length on Committee Stage and said he would come back to Senator Healy Eames on the matter.  I think he gave a partial answer yesterday.  He quoted statistics, not from Ireland but from Britain.  We can consider all the evidence available but I find it difficult to come up with any reason one would oppose the request that, where it absolutely would not in any way increase the health risk to the mother, the anaesthetic would be provided.<\/p><p>The argument has been made that we listened to consultants here in this room during the hearings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  Those hearings were very useful but this particular issue was not addressed.  Why not?  It was not addressed because until now we had a very different model of health care provision from the one we are about to introduce.  We also listened to medical consultants stating on the record that in other jurisdictions they would not have to participate in termination procedures if they had a conscientious objection to them.  Now we will introduce a regime where such medical procedures will have to be provided.<\/p><p>What Senators Healy Eames and Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien are proposing is that we would at least try to do so in a humane fashion.  I support the amendment.  I heard the Minister's partial response yesterday and I have heard the response of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy White, which go back to what we were told in the early stages of the debate, namely, that there could be no substantive amendments and nothing other than the original Bill would be accepted.  Maybe that is the problem.  The gate has been closed and we have been told that even reasonable amendments simply will not be accepted.   I find this amendment very reasonable and the public would find it very difficult to oppose.<\/p><p>We speak about what the opinion polls tell us but we should never be led by opinion polls.  Some of my colleagues love to quote polls saying 80% or 90% of people want this or that judgment.  If one asked the Irish people in an opinion poll do they feel that an unborn child, whose life is about to be ended, should at least be provided with the dignity and the pain relief of an anaesthetic, there would not be 70% or 80% in favour, there would be 100%.  We should at least be reasonable in responding to that.  I accept that the Minister will not accept any amendment whatsoever but it is important that we put on the record this request from at least a minority of this House.  I think the majority of Irish people would want this amendment to receive fair consideration.  How can anybody say &quot;No&quot; to pain relief?  How can anybody say &quot;No&quot; to humanity?  How can anybody say to &quot;No&quot; to giving at least some degree of dignity at the end of life to an unborn child?  As a society, if we say &quot;No&quot; to this amendment we are making a very profound and negative statement about the values or lack of values in our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300044#TT01900","speaker":"1121","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374594900,"counter":583,"content":"<p>This amendment deserves every support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300045#UU00200","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374594900,"counter":584,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300045#UU00300","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1374594900,"counter":585,"content":"<p>It is an attempt by humanity to stare ideology in the face.

We do not credibly believe that will be the case in the section 9 situations, precisely because, to all intents and purposes, the departure of the unborn from this world is what will be sought and there is a heightened need to have regard to the welfare of the unborn.

I refer to President Reagan's comment, \"When the lives of the unborn are snuffed out they often feel pain, pain that is long and agonizing\".  What has changed since 1984?  In 2012 the sub-committee on the Constitution, the US House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this issue.  Colleen Malloy is an assistant professor of neonatology at the department of paediatrics, Northwestern University school of medicine.  She stated that there is ample biological physiological hormonal and behavioural evidence for foetal and neonatal pain.  Professor Malloy told the committee that by 20 weeks post-fertilisation, or 22 weeks LNP, the foetal brain has the full complement of neurons present in adulthood.  When questioned she confirmed that the ability of the foetus to feel pain was the majority view of those in the field.  It has been suggested that an Irish report shows that this view is rubbish, even though this view is held all over the world, including in Britain.  Speakers can quote from such reports.  Senator Fidelma Healy Eames has researched this topic.  She has drawn the attention of the House to this issue, for which I compliment her.  I was not aware of this topic until this amendment was tabled.  She and Senator Mary Ann O'Brien should be applauded for bringing forward a compassionate amendment which tries to ensure that if a child is to be aborted, gruesome and barbaric as that it, that at least the pain is minimised during the process.  How can anyone argue with that?  The only reason for not accepting this amendment would be if a scientific report - an Irish report would be acceptable - shows clearly that foetal pain does not exist.  I do not believe such a report exists but perhaps the Minister of State can prove the contrary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300046#VV00300","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1374595500,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I remind Senators that there remain more than 50 amendments to be dealt with and we have less than two hours in which to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300046#VV00400","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1374595500,"counter":611,"content":"<p>We should keep going for the night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300046#VV00500","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1374595500,"counter":612,"content":"<p>The House has ordered the business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300046#VV00600","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1374595500,"counter":613,"content":"<p>It is most dispiriting to have to listen to this level of debate.

I am aware that yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, referred to two reports from two respected medical journals which stated that the unborn do not experience pain until post-29 weeks in one report or 24 weeks gestation in the second report.  I have done a lot of research on this topic since we first tabled the amendment.  I have 22 pages of information from the <i>British Medical Journal<\/i>, <i>The Lancet<\/i>, and doctors from all over the world who have given different opinions and different scientific views.  There is disagreement with some of the research science stating 18 weeks while others state 20, 22 or 16 weeks.  While I accept the Minister's words as being said in good faith, those words suited his argument.  This is definitely an area of uncertain science.  I have listed equally respected reports that contradict the two reports which the Minister cited.  I will accept that given the various range of views on the topic, depending on whether one is classed as pro-life or pro-choice, this area is uncertain.  When it comes to a burden of proof, one would have thought that the mature and civilised action would be to provide anaesthesia to the unborn at 20 weeks.  Our whole argument is for the protection of the mother's life and this amendment will not hamper that in any way.  Even if there is the slightest chance that some of my 18 pages of medical reports are correct, and that there is the slightest chance that the baby may feel pain, what is wrong with making this small amendment that will have an anaesthetist present to ensure the unborn baby does not feel pain?<\/p> <p>If the Minister of State cannot accept the amendment for any reason, I propose that we introduce a Bill very similar to the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives on 18 June 2013 in the most liberal abortion regime in the world, namely, the United States.  We should do so this autumn if he cannot see his way to accepting this provision.  I had predicted that the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, would protest, in respect of the amendment, that we cannot be prescriptive in the legislation.  Is is clear, however, that we can be prescriptive enough to ask two doctors to make a decision, quite rightly, in cases in which a mother is suicidal.  I am asking the Minister of State to consider that perhaps my science is correct and we should insist on an anaesthetist being present in the circumstances I have indicated.  It is the least we can do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300046#VV02100","speaker":"1169","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374596100,"counter":629,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300047#WW00200","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374596100,"counter":630,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300047#WW00300","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1374596100,"counter":631,"content":"<p>These amendments broadly concern the issue of viability.  In making reference to a medical practitioner's reasonable opinion, the Bill places a statutory duty on each practitioner forming an opinion to have regard to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable.  This imposes a clear duty on doctors to make every effort to preserve the life of the foetus where possible.  We had a discussion last night on what is meant by \"where possible\".  A failure to do so would place a medical practitioner in breach of the proposed legislation and subject to its penalties.<\/p><p>The Bill does not impose any time limits on carrying out the medical procedure at issue with reference to the gestational stage of a pregnancy.  The approach adopted provides protection for the unborn at all stages of pregnancy.  This is because the legislation only covers situations in which there is a real and substantial risk to the life of a pregnant woman which can only be averted by termination of pregnancy.  The limit of potential viability is subject to change as developments in medical treatments progress.  It would be incorrect to legislate for a particular gestation limit as to do so could have the effect of depriving unborn life which has not reached that limit of protection.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 21 makes proposals regarding civil and criminal liability for negligence.  As it is not the purpose of this Bill to regulate obstetric procedures such as the delivery of a viable premature infant or to change the law of negligence in regard to the practice of obstetrics, I cannot accept the amendment.  It should be noted that normal cover for medical practitioners, through their professional regulatory mechanisms, will apply in such situations.  Standard medical practice will provide appropriate mechanisms for the assessment and treatment of both the woman and the unborn.  It would not be appropriate to include this or other details of medical treatments in legislation.<\/p><p>I have reviewed the information from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames on the matter of foetal pain and have consulted my own medical advisers and officials in that regard.  Having done so, I am satisfied with the position put forward in the Bill.  To reiterate, it is not intended that the legislation will be prescriptive in regard to clinical practice.  Clinical decisions, including the provision of pain relief, will be taken by the clinical team involved in line with evidence-based international practice.  For these reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendments.<\/p><p>If colleagues consider it helpful, I will reiterate the response the Minister gave to Senator Healy Eames yesterday in respect of the various studies she quoted in the course of the debate.  I am happy to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300047#WW00400","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1374596100,"counter":632,"content":"<p>There is no point unless the Minister of State has something new to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300047#WW00500","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374596100,"counter":633,"content":"<p>There is often a tendency - I concede that it is not confined to one or other perspective in this debate - to quote from experts and expertise which tend to support or validate the argument one is putting forward.  That is perfectly allowable and is a legitimate form of debate.  There is no difficulty about it.  We are all inclined to reach for studies that tend to support the case we wish to make.  What the Government must do, however - and, I would respectfully suggest, what the Oireachtas must ultimately do, having considered the broad sweep of evidence - is to come to a conclusion on the matter at hand.  I make no criticism of Senators in observing that we have heard all the arguments at great length.  I would not presume to say how this House should approach its business, but the Government certainly must have regard to more than one particular perspective.<\/p><p>  Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen referred several times to doctors having particular ideologies.  It may be reasonable to use that word but the reality is that one person's ideology is often matched with an ideology on the other side of the argument.  It is not proper or prudent to rely on selective quotation; we must have regard to all the evidence and studies.  The Minister referred yesterday to multidisciplinary, systematic and peer-reviewed studies, not just reaching to one or another study here or there but looking to see what is the broad sweep of opinion.  In fairness to Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, she made the point that there is a great deal of controversy about this issue.  Those of us who have occasion to follow the debate in the United States can observe that it is a hugely contentious topic in that country, as indeed it is elsewhere.<\/p><p>  The study published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association<\/i> in 2005, as referenced by the Minister yesterday, looked at a range of different studies, concluded that the evidence regarding the capacity for foetal pain is limited and indicated that foetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester.  The article observed that the capacity for conscious perception of pain can arise only after the thalamocortical pathways begin to function, which usually occurs at around 29 or 30 weeks' gestation.  The Minister went on to refer to the study in the United Kingdom undertaken by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists following recommendations by a House of Commons committee in 1997.  That study, published in 2010, reviewed all the evidence, including the recently published literature.  This is the type of broad-ranging review that is required.  It is no good simply accessing a study that takes one particular approach.  It is still possible to come to a particular conclusion on one or other side of the argument, but it should not be done based on a flow of studies or arguments from one particular perspective.  I would respectfully suggest that this is not good law-making.  It is not what we mean by evidence.  When we talk about an evidence-based approach, it does not mean looking for a study that tends to support what we want to do.  That is not my understanding of the proper marshalling of evidence in a legislative pursuit.  It is about looking at all the evidence in the round.  Senator Ivana Bacik made a fair point when she referred to the tendency to be overly reliant on medical opinion from the United States.  The reality is that even in that country, medical opinion is not universally taking one particular perspective on this issue, as even a cursory look at the reporting will show.<\/p><p>  Senator Paul Bradford is putting a negative characterisation on the position we have taken in this debate in claiming that we were never willing to accept amendments.  After the heads of the Bill were published and debated in the committee hearings process and the legislation was brought to the D&aacute;il, we made clear our willingness to consider amendments which improved the operation of the Bill.  What has happened, however, is that we simply were not in a position to accept many of the amendments brought forward.  There is no arguing with Members' rights to bring forward proposals; it is perfectly legitimate to do so.  There can be no denial, however, that the majority of amendments - not all, perhaps, but certainly a lot of them - reflected colleagues' basic objection to section 9.  I understand Senator Jim Walsh conceded that point last night; if I am wrong, he will correct me.  Senators have adopted lots of different ways to attack that section, as is their right.  That, essentially, is what most of the amendments have been about.  The bottom line, however, is that the Government is not amenable to removing section 9.  We will not agree to any amendments which seek, whether directly or indirectly, to undermine the operation of that section.  That is our position and it is for the Seanad to make its own decisions.<\/p> <p> I wish to make clear that the Government was open to amendments which might assist in improving the operation of the Bill.  However, it was not interested in those which seek to drive a coach and four through its provisions.  We are not prepared to accept such amendments.  That is what we meant when we indicated that we would accept amendments which improved the operation of the legislation.  For those reasons, it is not proposed to accept the amendments in this group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300047#WW00600","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374596700,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I agree with considering all the evidence in the round.  My background is in research and I am aware that one does not just examine one item of evidence and draw a conclusion from it.  To deny that there is no up-to-date medical evidence which shows that an unborn baby feels pain is to completely mislead the House.  I will identify some patterns from the information available.  There is broad agreement that after 26 the unborn feels pain.  Some new evidence is emerging which indicates that the unborn feels pain from 17 weeks onwards.  It is for this reason that - as a precautionary principle - I included the phrase \"where the unborn is sixteen weeks gestation or older\" in amendment No. 9.  The precautionary principle suggests that there should be no doubt that the unborn may feel pain.  As a result of the uncertainty - and just in case - surely the humane and compassionate course of action would be to provide for relief at that moment of the ending of life of an unborn baby.  That is what we are doing here.<\/p><p>I spoke to two obstetricians yesterday, one of whom informed me that from 17 weeks onwards the procedure to end the life of a baby involves injecting potassium chloride into the heart.  Those who perform such procedures are guided by ultrasound.  Within one minute, this causes the baby to have a heart attack.  It is the very same lethal injection that is used in executions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300048#XX00200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1374596700,"counter":636,"content":"<p>Not in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300048#XX00300","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1374596700,"counter":637,"content":"<p>What I have just outlined is how an Irish obstetrician described to me the way in which these procedures are carried out elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300048#XX00400","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1374596700,"counter":638,"content":"<p>Who is the person to whom the Senator refers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300048#XX00500","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1374596700,"counter":639,"content":"<p>I would be happy to provide the Minister of State with his name after the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300048#XX00600","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1374596700,"counter":640,"content":"<p>No, the Senator should place it on the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300048#XX00700","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1374596700,"counter":641,"content":"<p>I would be happy to give it to the Minister of State afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300048#XX00800","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1374596700,"counter":642,"content":"<p>Put it on the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300048#XX00900","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1374596700,"counter":643,"content":"<p>Many names have been offered in this House and they have been rejected by the Cathaoirleach.

However, the legislation provides for the lawfulness of procedures in the course of which or as a result of which an unborn human life is ended.  Not only has the Government resisted taking a precautionary approach to the possibility that the unborn, in the context of the termination of a pregnancy, might feel pain but Members have also seen a refusal to take on board a direct duty to protect the life of an unborn who is viable, as well as the rejection of specific language that would require this where it was practicable to so do.  This is extremely troubling.  As I stated, the issue is that instead of using the word &quot;ended&quot;, that is, in the context of the lawfulness of procedures leading to the ending of life, one should be talking about the possibility of life being lost.  <\/p><p>  As was stated on Committee Stage, I seek to protect and provide for situations where it is clear to medical personnel that they are at no disadvantage from the perspective of civil or criminal law in the event that they perform the procedure in question but the child does not die and that, in fact, it is desirable that the child not die where that is avoidable.  The Government has been talking out of both sides of its mouth because, on the one hand, it has been stating it is desirable that the child should not die where it is possible to provide for this, but there is nothing in the language used in the legislation to give comfort on that point.  It appears that the word &quot;lost&quot; would be more appropriate if what the Government intends doing in any of these sections pertains to ending the pregnancy but trying to save the life where that is practicable.  Ideally, instead of talking about when, in the course of which or as a result of which &quot;an unborn life is ended&quot;, wording stating &quot;a pregnancy would be ended and the life of the unborn endangered or lost&quot; should be used.  The idea that the life would be lost really honours more what the Constitution requires, which is respect for the equal right to life of the unborn.  Therefore, it appears that the word &quot;lost&quot; would introduce no ambiguity but bring much reassurance that where it was practicable to so do, the life of the child would always be saved.<\/p><p>  There are two dimensions to the amendments.  The first is the more desirable language of loss, implying that the intention is to save life, if at all possible, and that it is a regrettable fact that the child's life is to be lost, not a sought end in itself.  The second aspect is the use of the phrase &quot;may be&quot; instead of the word &quot;is&quot; in the context of the life being lost or ended because that would make it clear that such procedures would not necessarily end in the death of the child in post-viability situations and that doctors were both fully protected and fully expected to protect life in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300049#ZZ00200","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374597300,"counter":709,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300049#ZZ00300","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1374597300,"counter":710,"content":"<p>I am unsure whether I understand fully the rationale for this amendment, even though I have listened carefully to Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen.  In the first instance, I will give a general response and will then seek to consider precisely what he has said in support of his amendment.  <\/p><p>  As was stated on Committee Stage, the Bill, as drafted, reflects the policy requirements to implement the judgment in A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland which pertains only to effective and accessible procedures being available.  However, the change proposed by the Senator would have the effect of bringing a greater number of medical procedures under the Bill.  For example, medical procedures which are currently carried out but which may pose a risk to the unborn such as amniocentesis or the administration of a general anaesthetic do not require legal certification, apart from clinical indication, and it would not be desirable for them to so do.  There would at least be a risk that this would be the effect of what the Senator has proposed.  However, having examined the words proposed by him, I am still somewhat at a loss as to what is the rationale for this proposal.  I believe he will agree with me that irrespective of one's perspective on what is proposed in this legislation, the Bill must provide clarity with regard to what is protected.  As a result, sections 7 to 9, inclusive, particularly sections 7 and 9, begin with the phrase &quot;It shall be lawful&quot;.  In addition, the phrase &quot;it shall be lawful&quot; appears on the second line of section 8.  The Bill is making it clear what is lawful and regardless of whether one likes it, the clear intention of the sections is that it shall be lawful.

The Minister of State pointed out that we are against the substantive issue of section 9, and that is true.  We have made no secret of that.  However, that does not mean that issues such as foetal pain and trying to confine the procedures that are allowed for abortion should not been have favourably considered, as they would not have changed the substantive issue.  Anyway, so be it; that has not been done.<\/p><p>  With regard to my objection to section 9, I am objecting fundamentally to suicide as a ground because there is no medical evidence in this regard.  Even with regard to the last discussion, in which I think the Minister of State missed the point that was being made, where the phrase &quot;it shall be lawful&quot; was used in the context of when unborn human life has ended, what happens if the baby survives?  It is silent as to whether that procedure is lawful or not.  We do know that this will happen, particularly in that period post-viability in which babies can be seriously disabled.<\/p><p>  There is a point I want to develop on this.  There are a number of points, and this probably will be my last time to get in because I imagine there will be quite a bit of discussion of this group of amendments and this section.  I will quote from something I came across which articulates, maybe better than I can, my point of view in its regard and to which I referred at Second Stage, which was to do with the principle of the inviolability of human life.  It reads:<blockquote>  If we abandon the principle which teaches that innocent human life is inviolable, which is to say, that is it is sacred and must be protected by law, if we relinquish that principle, and begin to allow for the deliberate and direct destruction of human life, what basis will we have to object when the situation shifts further and other categories of vulnerable human beings are under threat?  We will have none or very little, because we will have sacrificed the foundation, the basis, the principle: every human life is to be respected, because it is of inestimable value.  This recognition is at the origin of every human society and community.  It is not <i>per se<\/i> a religious truth; it is a human truth.<\/blockquote>I would go further and say that this is an objective truth.  It is not merely any ordinary truth; it is an objective truth.  Because it is an objective truth, it is accessible.  It is accessible by every Member of this House.  Through our knowledge, through the research that we have done on the issue, through our intelligence and through our reason and conscience, we can arrive at what the truth is.  I would argue that, on every issue, every decision and every Bill that comes before this House, there is a duty on us to seek out the truth.  It is not always as easily accessible as it is, in my opinion, in this context.<\/p><p>  I quote Pastor Martin Niem&ouml;ller, who spoke about the atrocities committed during the last century.  He wrote:<blockquote>First, they came for the socialists,<br \/> and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist.<br \/>Then they came for the trade unionists,<br \/> and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist.<br \/>Then they came for the Jews,<br \/>and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew.<br \/>Then they came for me,<br \/>and there was no one left to speak for me.<\/blockquote>Interestingly, something of which I was unaware, which I came across only within the past number of days, is that after the war the war crimes tribunal indicted ten Nazi leaders for encouraging and compelling abortions, which at that time was classed as a crime against humanity.  I would argue that it is as big a crime against humanity today as it was at that time.<\/p><p>  I am well aware, under this heading, that suicide is a major issue for society generally.<\/p> <p>I covered that on Second Stage.  If there were any medical evidence suggesting a woman who is suicidal could be relieved by giving her an abortion, we would be challenged in making our argument.  There is no such evidence.  This was clearly enunciated at all the health committee hearings.  Unfortunately, we continue with our approach.  I said yesterday in the presence of Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, that the abortion industry is evil.  It is a multi-million dollar industry and absolutely corrupts the thinking of people, including medical professionals. <\/p><p>I did some research on abortions since the practice was legalised in the 1960s.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300050#AAA02100","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374598500,"counter":737,"content":"<p>What is the relevance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300051#BBB00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1374598500,"counter":738,"content":"<p>Once we bring it in with the suicide clause, it will open the door.

If one accounts for the rest of the world, the number is in excess of 1 billion.  I could give statistics from many countries.<\/p><p>A document I saw recently indicated our maternal health rate is the second highest on a list of 150 countries.  Countries with liberal abortion regimes are well behind us in that regard.<\/p><p>Let me quote Deputy Brian Walsh on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  He made a comment that resonated with me and, I hope, the Minister and others.  He said we are now poised to perpetuate in legislation the absurd principle that the suicidality of one human being can be abated by the killing of another. <\/p><p>I have been particularly uncompromising in the language I have used and have made no apology for that because I believe the unborn have neither a voice nor a vote.  If those of a pro-life ethos are not prepared to articulate the innocent, vulnerable status of the unborn, their cause is totally conceded.  That would be to the shame of humanity.<\/p><p>On the suicide issue and the mental health issue in general, research in New Zealand, with which the Minister and his Department will certainly be familiar, shows the rate of mental disorders among women who have had an abortion is approximately 30% higher than among other women.  The research was produced by Professor David Fergusson, who is pro-choice.<\/p><p>I came across information on a commission on abortion headed by Lord Rawlinson in 1992.  The commission found that 80% of women who responded to a survey suffered from the long-term effects of abortion.<\/p><p>I tried to articulate three areas in my Second Stage speech.  One was concern for women faced with a medical emergency and who need every treatment available to save their lives.  I have no dispute with this and fully support the argument.  The second area concerns the women who are badly affected by having the procedure of abortion.  The third area is obviously the devastating effect for the unborn.<\/p><p>I have come across information from 2007 or 2008 that indicates that botched abortions mean scores of babies are born alive and left to die.

Section 9 is one to which, like Senator Walsh, I am absolutely opposed.  Senator Walsh has referred to various studies and reports.  One of the questions we must ask ourselves is whether abortion reduces the risk of suicide in pregnancy.  It is a valid question.  Dr. Eleanor Corcoran is an eminent psychiatrist of 27 years' standing who was based in England but now works at Letterkenny General Hospital.  She compiled a report examining all the studies, both pro-abortion and pro-life.  From her findings she could discover no suggestion in the core text-books of psychiatry, including perinatal psychiatry, that abortion is a treatment on its own or as part of a risk reduction measure for suicidality in pregnancy.<\/p><p>The issue of abortion as an aid to reducing suicide has been examined more directly in a series of studies from Finland.  The first of those studies, by Gissler in 1996, linked the individual records of those whose pregnancies ended either by delivery, miscarriage or abortion with the suicide records enabled by a common record number, between 1987 and 1994.  In total, over 650,000 women were involved.  The suicide rates in these were compared to the national average in Finland.  The study showed that with a national average suicide rate for women of 11.5 per 100,000, the rate of suicide after abortion was 34.7 per 100,000.  The rate of suicide after birth was only 5.9 per 100,000.  <\/p><p>The author suggests that either abortion caused the increase in suicide or there were factors common to abortion and suicide, such as mental illness or poor supports, that led to the increase.  One way or the other, this study confirms that abortion does not reduce the risk of suicide, but rather is associated with a several-fold increase.<\/p><p>A similar study covering a longer period-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300052#CCC04900","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1374599100,"counter":827,"content":"<p>All of this was debated on Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300052#CCC05000","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374599100,"counter":828,"content":"<p>No.  I have not raised any of this.

The study concluded by recommending a post-abortion check-up, as necessary, in order to detect signs of depression and to identify the rare cases of psychosis after an induced abortion.

The adequate recognition and treatment of mental illness during pregnancy is what is required.<br \/><br \/>  In an individual case it is claimed that an abortion might be of benefit.  The problem is that since suicide cannot be predicted there is no definitive way of identifying an individual woman who, on the balance of probability, is at risk of taking her life.  Also, since there are no studies indicating benefits from abortion it will be impossible to tell whether such an intervention will help or harm the woman or what the likely magnitude of either is.  The recommendation of the expert group in 2012 is that psychiatrists, in their role relating to the implementation of the X judgment, must ensure that their decision is evidence-based so as to comply with the Medical Council ethical guide, 2009.  This is not met in respect of abortion and suicide.<br \/><br \/>  In the event that legislation is enacted allowing for suicide risk as a ground for abortion, psychiatrists will be compromised.  This will arise if the woman insists she is suicidal, against the opinion of the examining psychiatrists, who might understandably be tempted to err on the side of caution and accede to her wishes.  Questions will also arise as to the role of a psychiatrist in recommending an abortion to a woman who is suicidal but does not have mental illness.  Being expected to make decisions of this sort jeopardises their role as medical professionals who treat mental illness.<br \/><br \/>  If legislation for abortion on the grounds of suicide risk is enacted psychiatrists will be expected to propose an unproven intervention - abortion - for a rare outcome, suicide, that is more often incorrectly rather than correctly predicted.<br \/><br \/>  The possibility of abuse of such a law is also a consideration in light of recent comments from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service.<\/blockquote>  On the implications of the expert group report on the A, B and C ruling, she stated:<blockquote>  Legislation for the X case should not include suicide risk as a ground for abortion in Ireland as there is no evidence that it is necessary and no evidence of benefit. Thus the requirement that treatments must be evidence-based is not met.<\/blockquote>  Abortion does not cure suicide.  All of the international evidence, from both pro-choice and pro-life psychiatrists, supports that.  If this Bill is about protecting lives and supporting women, we should provide the adequate care and attention women require during a difficult time in their lives.  Will Fine Gael and Labour Senators opposite, most of whom have been respectful during the course of this debate, consider at this late stage voting against this legislation because none of the evidence supports its introduction into Irish law?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300053#DDD03700","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1374599700,"counter":874,"content":"<p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill eloquently quoted from many reports that abortion does not decrease the risk of suicide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300053#DDD03800","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1374599700,"counter":875,"content":"<p>Reports from eminent consultants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300053#DDD03900","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1374599700,"counter":876,"content":"<p>Senator Gilroy without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300053#DDD04000","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374599700,"counter":877,"content":"<p>Yes, to support that contention.

If we acknowledge suicide and mental illness as presenting a real risk and if there is evidence, or none - I might be generous enough to say this - section 20 of the Bill offers protection against the ideologically driven doctor in the review to be laid before the Houses.  If there is an ideologically driven doctor who suddenly ignores all clinical risk, clinical and professional good practice, the Hippocratic oath, the views of his or her colleagues and peers and just about everyone else because he or she is absolutely adamant that people should be aborted, every year before 30 June we will see the pattern emerging in the review.

In Ireland, thankfully, under the Constitution there is a separation of church and State and our obligation is to uphold the Constitution.  There are two serious issues before us which previous Governments neglected for many years, including those which included my own party of Fianna F&aacute;il.  The first is how doctors faced with life or death decisions and in the absence of explanatory legislation are to interpret the constitutional provision that abortion can take place only where there is a real and substantial threat to the life of the mother.  Thankfully, the law before us sets out procedures and processes to guide doctors and protect them legally.<\/p><p>  In the X case in 1992, some 21 years ago, the Supreme Court held that a threat to commit suicide could constitute a real and substantial risk to the life of the pregnant mother.  As the Supreme Court is the interpreter of the Constitution, its finding in the X case remains the constitutional position which we, as legislators, are duty bound to respect.  We cannot have an <i>&agrave;<\/i><b><i><\/i><\/b><i>la carte<\/i> approach to accepting the legitimacy of judgments of the the Supreme Court.  We regularly accept as authoritative and binding its judgments on various issues.  It is not warranted to set aside its findings in the X case because they do not suit our personal disposition.  <\/p><p>  Let us not forget that the people have spoken in two referendums on this issue.  In 1992 the proposal that the possibility of suicide was not a sufficient threat to justify an abortion was defeated.  In 2002 the proposal to remove the threat of suicide as a ground for legal abortion in the State was again rejected by the people.  As legislators, we must respect the will of the people as demonstrated in these two referendums.  For ten years since the referendum in 2002 successive Governments led by Fianna F&aacute;il failed to deal with these two issues - providing clarification for doctors of the circumstances when abortion was permitted and legislating for the X case judgment.  <\/p><p>  In a poll in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> in June 2013 voters were asked several questions about the issue of abortion.<\/p> <p>A total of 89% of the people in the MRBI poll on 30 June said it should be allowed where a woman's life is at risk.

Mr. Justice McCarthy stated 20 years ago:<blockquote><br \/>I think it reasonable, however, to hold that the people when enacting the amendment [the 1983 amendment] were entitled to believe that legislation would be introduced so as to regulate the manner in which the right to life of the unborn and the right to life of the mother could be reconciled.  Failure by the Legislature to enact the appropriate legislation is no longer just unfortunate; it is inexcusable.  What are pregnant women to do?  What are the parents of a pregnant girl underage to do?  What are the medical profession to do?  They have no guidelines save what may be gleaned from the judgments in this case.  What additional considerations are there?...The Amendment, born of public disquiet, historically divisive of our people [we have seen that 20 years on again] guaranteeing in its laws to respect and by its laws to defend the right to life of the unborn remains bare of legislative direction.<\/blockquote>  We have not dealt with this issue over the past 20 years but this legislation does.  People dispute the X case judgment.  When the 1995 Bill was before the Supreme Court, the judges referred to the X case.  The court held: &quot;Having regard to the judgment and the decision of this Court, which recognises and emphasises the supremacy of the Constitution, this Court is satisfied that, in the consideration of the issues raised in that case and the conflicting constitutional rights involved, the proper principles were applied in the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Constitution and in the determination of the issues raised therein.&quot;  The court set out that there was a need to put in place legislation in order that there would be clear guidance for the courts in dealing with this matter.  Guidance is also needed for the medical profession and that is exactly what we are providing in this legislation.<\/p><p>  Only one medical report was produced in the X case because the courts had no guidelines.

Such medicine is drawn up by panels of doctors, national steering committees, professional organisations, institutions and faculties within institutions when they have examined the raw data, listened to opinion leaders in the field and read meta analyses.  If the weight of evidence-based medicine is that an abortion is never necessary to prevent a suicide, then an abortion will never occur to prevent a suicide.  That is the truth.  Some Members are assuming that either doctors will ignore evidence-based medicine deliberately or will be so incredibly incompetent that they will not be familiar with the teachings of evidence-based medicine and with contentious issues.<\/p><p>It is not even possible to say that the Senators who are terribly worried are concerned that perhaps one rogue doctor acting &quot;malfeasantly&quot; could make the decision; they are saying that three rogue doctors acting in collusion will make the decision.  These are my colleagues and friends they are talking about.  These Members are saying they are fighting to protect women and unborn children from the malfeasance of the woman who comes into lie in the first place to say she is suicidal and from the malfeasance and the incompetence of the three doctors who will collude with her in the wilful destruction of her unborn child for some other reason entirely.  There is no short cut around that.  That is that they are saying and I do not believe it.<\/p><p>There has been one tragedy in this country where there was a departure from evidence-based medicine because of legal constraints.  We are all aware of the case where a sad outcome occurred and a young woman died.  There were multiple factors involved and we will not conduct our own mini-inquest here but on the Monday she went into hospital, ambiguity was introduced into the minds of doctors who, if they were thinking only in terms of medicine-based medicine and were not legally constrained, might have made a different medical decision, which was in accordance with evidence-based medicine.  That is the decision that somebody was having an inevitable miscarriage.  Somebody's precious first baby could not be saved; it was going to die.  Under those circumstances one would induce the labour rather than let the woman run the risk of potentially life threatening infection.  The ambiguity was there because there is ambiguity in our law.  This is not some hypothetical construct; this happened.  People need to be aware of all the issues surrounding evidence-based medicine in this circumstance.<\/p> <p> I would also appeal for consideration to be given to some of the other amendments, although I know I am going to be ruled out of order on this.

The reality is that amendment No. 14, which I have proposed, changes the test required for the certifying doctors - those who will have the responsibility of certifying the procedure - from being a subjective good faith test of a kind which is increasingly discredited, to a more objective test that requires them to have regard to the relevant clinical evidence and to then jointly certify.

Far from it being a case, as the Government likes to posit, of \"Let us save one life to avoid losing two\", where there is an underlying mental health condition, it has been explained to us very clearly that abortion or any sudden life-changing decision could be contra-indicated - we heard that from Dr. John Sheehan, the perinatal psychiatrist.

The national asthma programme was developed in 2010, modelled on a successful pilot project carried out by the Asthma Society of Ireland.  The aim of the programme is to bring about a reduction in asthma deaths by 90% over ten years and a 10% reduction in hospital admissions, out of hours and emergency department visits over three years.  This programme has already been a successful pilot.<\/p><p>It is now three years since the inception of the programme, but it has not been officially signed off and patients are not enrolled to take the programme forward.  As a result of the commitment not being given to this initiative, emergency admissions for asthma patients increased in 2012 by 20% from the previous year.  This is unfortunate, because asthma is an extremely manageable condition.  There is no reason somebody whose asthma is being managed properly and who is on proper medication should find himself or herself being brought to hospital or suffering from an acute attack.  We have the medicine to prevent this and we have the procedures by which asthma can be managed, but unfortunately patients are not engaged in proper asthma management programmes like those that are standard practice in other countries.<\/p><p>I have tabled this matter today so as to urge the Minister of State to ensure that in next year's budget, priority is given to the roll-out of the asthma management programme put forward by the Asthma Society of Ireland.  I urge him to ensure that the necessary staff are provided and that the 17 clinical nurse specialists required for the roll-out of the programme are recruited.  The programme must also be included in the HSE's service plan.  The Asthma Society of Ireland also raised the issue of the new GP contract.  GPs are an essential point of access to the health service and they are the people those with medical conditions see most frequently.  It is essential to ensure that all GPs are properly trained in this regard and that they give priority to helping people manage their asthma.  As the Minister of State is aware, approximately 470,000 people in Ireland have asthma - one out of every ten adults and one out of every five children.  People with asthma make up the largest chronic disease group in the country.  The majority of those affected are under 14 and their quality of life is badly affected by the condition.<\/p><p>Other issues that must be examined include education on the condition.  The Asthma Society of Ireland provided me with some excellent materials it has developed for schools.  We need to ensure the education system and teachers are given greater training on managing this, particularly PE teachers.  Many young people only develop asthma in their teens and the PE teacher could well be the first person with them when they have an exercise induced attack.  There is a need for action across the board on this issue.  Resources are also needed and if these are put into the right area and into prevention and management of asthma, this would save the health service significant moneys over time.<\/p><p>As matters stand, people unnecessarily find themselves on nebulisers, etc., in emergency departments.  This would be avoidable if resources were put into the primary care area.  Other European countries, such as the UK and Finland, have shown how this can be done.  They have advanced the primary care model and patient self-management, through having GPs train patients in how to manage their condition and to manage it with a peak flow meter and to respond when they realise they are in trouble.  In Finland, a similar programme to that proposed by the Asthma Society of Ireland resulted in a 90% reduction in deaths, an 85% reduction in hospital admissions and a 50% reduction in the cost of treating each patient.<\/p><p>I tabled this matter to highlight this issue for the Minister of State.  I acknowledge we are heading into the budget process and that there are many priorities for next year in the Department of Health.  However, I stress that smart investment in this area can save significant money and can also save lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300058#JJJ00900","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1374602400,"counter":989,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Power for raising this issue.  It is good to have support and as Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, the more support I have from all sides of the House in regard to resources and the expansion and enhancement of primary care, the better.  I agree with and thank the Senator for her remarks in that regard.<\/p><p>The national clinical programme for asthma, which commenced in 2011, is one of a number of chronic disease programmes established in the HSE's clinical care directorate aimed at bringing a systematic approach to changes in how services for patients are delivered.  The national programme is included in the HSE's 2013 operational plan.  Implementation of the programme is ongoing and will continue in 2014.  The overarching aim of the national asthma programme is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with asthma in Ireland and to improve clinical outcomes and the quality of life of all patients with asthma.  A key component is improved management of people with asthma in primary care, thereby avoiding emergency attendance at GP, out-of-hours services, hospital emergency departments and in-patient admission services.<\/p><p>In the first year of programme implementation, there was an 8% reduction in acute hospital bed days for acute asthma.  The target for the national asthma programme is a further fall by 10% or more per year over the next three years, through implementing the programme's asthma guidelines and model of care.  The national asthma programme is developing a national model of care for asthma, with an implementation plan which will detail how physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals will work with engaged patients to make the clinical decisions most appropriate to their circumstances and which will collaborate with specialist colleagues in providing a safe, seamless patient experience within the health system in Ireland.  This is a key deliverable aspect of the national asthma programme for 2013.<\/p> <p> As 85% of asthma is managed in primary care without the need for hospital specialist services, the national asthma programme is undertaking work to look at providing a yearly programme of assessment for asthma at primary care level.  The model of care will focus on the following:  \"Asthma Check\" outlines the step-by-step process for implementation of guideline-based asthma management in primary care, to deliver optimal outcomes for patients, with the aim being to facilitate the implementation of best practice asthma guidelines in primary care in order to improve asthma control; improving access to hospital-based specialist asthma service from primary and secondary care services, through scheduled or rapid access asthma services and access to specialist asthma therapies; improving links through clinical nurse specialists and asthma nurse specialists within the community services; developing and implementing a standard referral pathway to asthma services; developing structured assessment and review protocols throughout the system; establishing uniform discharge protocols; facilitating access to accurate asthma diagnostics; and examining solutions to develop and subsequently implement an asthma database register linked into all care levels, namely, GP, community pharmacist and hospital.<\/p><p>Implementation of the model of care by clinicians and managers is and will be supported by a range of documents describing care pathways, clinical guidelines and other decision-making tools.  A draft model of care has been circulated to the programme's clinical advisory group for its feedback.  This will be incorporated in the document and approval sought for external consultation.  It is expected that the model of care will be published by the end of this year.<\/p><p>The programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS general practitioner contract with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary primary care teams.  Officials in the Department are working with the HSE with a view to drawing up and agreeing a new contract.  The appropriate arrangements for chronic disease programmes will be considered as part of the new GMS contract.<\/p><p>The level of funding available for the health budget for 2014 has not yet been determined.  The HSE is currently engaged in the estimates process.  When the national clinical programme for asthma's model of care has been completed, an assessment can be made on how it will be implemented in the acute hospital and primary care system and what resources, including nursing resources, will be required.<\/p><p>I agree with the tenor and the direction of the Senator's observations and remarks this evening on the issue.  I understand the importance of providing the kind of services and supports in primary care that she has outlined.  I met with representatives of the Asthma Society of Ireland last Friday.  I had a very good meeting with them, during the course of which many of these issues were raised, and I was able to give them my assurance that everything that can be done will be done in order to advance the kind of services and requirements that I believe are necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300058#JJJ01000","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374603000,"counter":991,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the positive tone of his reply.

The Minister of State mentioned that it is hoped that the model of care will be prepared before the end of the year.

This has come to the fore following Prime Minister Cameron's speech yesterday in the UK.  It has been discussed previously in this House.  He addressed many issues yesterday.  The Minister for Justice and Equality agreed in this House to do what he can to ensure that our obligations under the directive on combatting sexual exploitation of children are implemented.  I understand that he is engaging with Internet service providers so that we can get to the position where such material can be blocked.<\/p><p>  It is a very serious issue.  Every image of a child that we see in such a situation is a crime.  Anybody who looks at such images is perpetrating a crime.  The enormous growth of the Internet and its potential has certainly added to this.  It has probably not got much attention until recently, but it was addressed by the UK Prime Minister yesterday.  We need to see action on it and we await the Minister's statement as to how he proposes to proceed in that area.<\/p><p>  The issue of obnoxious or extreme pornography and violence and simulated rape situations was also raised.  I understand that such material is blocked in this jurisdiction, whereas it has not been blocked in the UK for technical reasons.  Legal pornography should also be restricted.  My generation would know of the likes of <i>Playboy<\/i> , adult movies and the 9 p.m. watershed on television, but such material is also on the Internet and there are no restrictions on it.  It is available to children at home on their laptops, iPads and PCs.  We can only begin to imagine the potential.  Children are vulnerable.  They need to be protected in their formative years, because pornographic images such as these can actually distort their view of a sexual relationship.  It can be very difficult for them.  It should not happen and we should control it.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources said on the radio today that this issue had not been raised with him before in this House.  It has been raised with the Minister for Justice and Equality, but I do not know if it has been raised directly with Deputy Rabbitte.  I know that Deputy Shatter said he would take the matter on board.  We clearly need to see action to ensure that issues such as adult pornography, which should only be available for adults, are filtered so that they can be controlled.  There has been criticism of filters and any tech savvy child can get around it, but it is not a defence to throw our hands up in the air.  We want to try to avoid the situation where a child casually scanning different Internet sites comes across this material accidentally.  We also need to educate parents who are not aware of it.  They are not tech savvy like their children, unless they have high levels of skill themselves.  They can be completely unaware of what their children are being exposed to.<\/p><p>  The UK Prime Minister, in consultation with Internet service providers, is proposing a filter that would block this material permanently and if adults want to access such material, they can request that the filtering mechanism be turned off.  That sounds like a very reasonable and sensible approach.  He is also proposing that public WiFi be family friendly and that logos can claim that the WiFi in a particular area is family friendly.<\/p><p>  We need to move on this issue.  The growth of pornography on the Internet is continuing.  It is racing ahead of all of us.  Like anything, when we put something in place, we have to jump higher again.  We need to engage with the service providers and ensure that they live up to their huge responsibility in this area.  Ultimately, people look to the Government and legislators to raise awareness and to discuss how we can implement protection measures for our vulnerable children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300059#KKK00400","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"speech","time":1374603000,"counter":995,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.<\/p> <p>We all accept that the web is one of the great innovations of our age.  It has already brought huge benefits and has the potential to expand our knowledge in ways we could not have imagined only a few decades ago.  Sadly, new innovations do not come with a guarantee against misuse.  There are two distinct aspects of the Internet's evolution that concern us today and that arise from Senator Clune's contribution, the first being the fact that the web has long been used for the distribution of legal - if restricted - pornographic materials, and the second being around the entirely unacceptable practice of the web's use to circulate images of child abuse.<\/p><p> This latter issue has been the subject of a sustained and very substantial effort on the part of states all over the world, and with some success.  For example, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Deputy Shatter, had the opportunity recently during the Irish Presidency of the EU to raise the need for enhanced international cooperation in tackling the dissemination of child pornography.  The EU and the USA have initiated a global alliance against child sexual abuse on-line and I gather that this initiative is expected to develop quickly in the coming years.  Moreover, discussions on the establishment of a structured arrangement for the blocking of access to websites containing child pornography are at an advanced stage.<\/p><p> The arrangement that is being discussed will entail close collaboration between the Garda and Internet service providers, ISPs.  It will be based on a written agreement and procedures between the garda&iacute; and individual ISPs.  Under the proposed arrangement the garda&iacute; will identify sites and, when satisfied that the material is child pornography and therefore illegal, they will notify the ISP of the sites in question.  The ISP will then act in accordance with the agreed arrangements to block access to the site or sites.  The Garda will have the benefit of its links with other police forces and the international policing organisations such as Interpol and Europol in seeking out and identifying sites.  The arrangements about which I have spoken are in line with the provisions of EU Directive 2011\/93 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, in particular Article 25 of that directive.  Article 25 provides for measures against websites containing or disseminating child pornography.  The first part of the article deals with the removal of web pages containing such material.  In Ireland the <i>hotline.ie<\/i>service already provides for the removal of illegal material.  It has performed very well and has had some notable successes in fighting this scourge.  The second part of Article 25 is concerned with blocking access to sites containing or disseminating child pornography.  The arrangements under discussion between the garda&iacute; and the ISPs would provide us with a mechanism that fulfils the second part of Article 25.<\/p><p> I want to return to an aspect of the debate on blocking or restricting access to sites that causes genuine concern to many people.  There are concerns about State censorship and interference with freedom of speech if official agencies are given powers to effect these measures.  These are genuine and legitimate concerns.  Some see any step in this direction as a beginning, the thin end of the wedge.  Where the material involves children, however, different factors apply.  We must recall that, not only are they forced to participate but, by virtue of their age alone, they do not have the capacity to consent to taking part.  They have no freedom to exercise free choice and because of their age, they are unable to exercise that free choice.  Therefore, while protecting the general principle of free expression, we must ensure that we also protect the very basic integrity of the children involved.  In my view, the safeguarding of children must be the first priority.<\/p><p> The British Prime Minister's remarks on what is termed &quot;filtering&quot; focus the debate on a slightly different matter, however, the question of controlling access by children to material that is pornographic in nature.  My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, spoke about the UK plans on radio this morning.  He told &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; he was prepared to take a look at the proposals from the UK Government and I agree that we should examine these with some urgency.  The extent of the effects of widely available pornography on the development of young people is not yet fully understood, and it is entirely understandable that parents would seek means to address this.  Both the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence have long had programmes in place to support children, young people and parents in engaging and dealing with the on-line world.  After all, the world-wide web is of profound benefit in expanding our knowledge of the world, and central to the future careers of many of our young people - the last thing we want is fear of what it might hold.  There is also a wide range of available tools that can be used to set content restrictions on devices.  The route taken by the UK Government, however, asking Internet service providers to set a &quot;default on&quot; block is something new.  It is unlikely to be without its problems in implementation but it may well be worth considering.<\/p><p> To conclude, I want to assure the Senator and the House of my own and the Government's strong commitment to the safety of children, on- and off-line, and that we will continue to consider any additional steps that can be taken in cases where children are put at risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300059#KKK00500","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374603600,"counter":997,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and I note the comments of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, that he believes it is probably worthwhile looking at the issue of pornography and children's access to it, not necessarily child pornography but pornography in general that is legal but access to which should be restricted.<\/p><p>The Minister of State said that the extent of the effects of widely available pornography on the development of young people is not yet fully understood.

I am interested in knowing what procedure will be used to fill the vacancy at the very important Office of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner once the incumbent, Ms Emily O'Reilly, takes up her job in Europe.  I want to put on record my admiration for the work she has done.  It is an enormous tribute to her abilities and reputation that she succeeded in being elected to the position of European Ombudsman and I wish her every success in that role.  If she brings to it the qualities that she brought to her domestic position every citizen of Europe will benefit.<\/p><p>We are lucky that since the Irish Government in the early 1980s put in place the Office of the Ombudsman - if I recall correctly the first holder of the position was Michael Mills - we have been very well served and countless thousands of citizens, sometimes in a very quiet way, have benefited from the investigations put in place time after time by the Ombudsman.  It is fair to say that sometimes the Office of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner seems just like another Department but all of us as politicians would have used the office and it is very reassuring to hear from people that, not only do they always get very detailed correspondence from the office, but occasionally they get a telephone call from a very senior official of that office and sometimes from the Ombudsman him or herself.  It is a great interaction between an office of State and the citizen which is very reassuring.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I wish Ms O'Reilly well in her new and very significant posting but I want to know what process or procedure or application must be entered into to replace her.  I recall that previously the appointment was made on the recommendation of the Minister for Finance to the Government.  Are there now public appointments or is there a panel or some sort of application form on the back of one's local newspaper?  The Minister of State might advise me on this.  We look forward to matters progressing and the next person, man or woman, doing the same effective job on behalf of every citizen of the State as Ms O'Reilly and her predecessors did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300060#LLL00400","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1374603600,"counter":1000,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Bradford for raising this matter.  As he and the House are aware, Ms Emily O'Reilly has offered her resignation from the Office of Ombudsman and Information Commissioner with effect from 29 September 2013.  I would like to take this opportunity to join with Senator Bradford in congratulating her on her election by the European Parliament as European Ombudsman and to wish her every success in her new role.  I think we can all agree that Ms O'Reilly has made a significant contribution over the past 10 years as Ombudsman and Information Commissioner.  I join Senator Bradford in acknowledging this before the House and thank her for all her work and dedication.  I agree with Senator Bradford's remarks and would like personally to congratulate Ms O'Reilly and wish her well as somebody whom I knew for many years in our respective previous careers.  I wish her every success in her new role.<\/p><p>I agree entirely with what Senator Bradford said about the broader question of the importance, efficiency and professionalism of the Office of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner.  Some of us in Government have been at the receiving end of decisions made by that independent office. <\/p> <p>As Ministers, we may not have liked them, but, of course, we accept them and fully acknowledge that the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner has acted entirely professionally and properly and in the public interest throughout her tenure in this role, just as her predecessors did.<\/p><p> The remit and powers of the Ombudsman were recently expanded following the passage of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012.  The Ombudsman's remit now covers all Departments, local authorities, the HSE, and <i>circa<\/i>180 additional public bodies recently added to the remit.  This is a positive development which will empower citizens in their interactions with public bodies and help to further improve standards of public administration.  The role of the Ombudsman is not simply to examine individual complaints but also to ensure a better quality service for customers or clients of public bodies by improving the system of public administration.<\/p><p> The process to be followed in the appointment of a new Ombudsman is set out in the Ombudsman Act 1980, as amended.  The appointment is made by the President following nomination by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  Since the Freedom of Information Act 1997 came into force, the Ombudsman has also held the office of Information Commissioner.  Appointment to the post is by a similar process to that for the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman also serves as Commissioner for Environmental Information and is an <i>ex officio<\/i>member of the SIPOC, the CPSA, the Referendum Commission and the Constituency Commission.<\/p><p> The 2012 legislation now provides that the appointment may be preceded by consideration by a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas as may be designated by the relevant Minister.  It is the intention of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that once a nominee has been approved by the Government, a referral will be made to the Public Services Oversight and Petitions Committee.<\/p><p> The Ombudsman is a senior public official charged with monitoring the public administration through the examination and investigation of complaints from members of the public who believe they have been adversely affected by the administrative actions of a public body.  The person appointed will be capable of leading a high profile institution through a period of expansion and change.  A broad understanding and knowledge of Irish public administration, including the political and legal systems and the governance of public bodies, is essential.  He or she should also demonstrate high level knowledge of current affairs and an understanding of the role of the institution of the Ombudsman within the public administration system, both in Ireland and internationally.  The person appointed should also be recognised, either publicly or within his or her own professional area, as an individual of proven integrity and independence.  He or she will have significant and high level professional achievements and be capable of presenting as the public face of the Office of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner with credibility and authority.  Good media or public speaking skills would be an advantage.<\/p><p> The practice in the past under previous Administrations was for the relevant Minister to ask the Government to note the name of the proposed nominee for the position prior to the resolutions placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is of the view that a more open approach should be adopted to the nomination process and he will be inviting expressions of interest in the appointment by public advertisement.  This will widen the pool of possible candidates from which a nominee can be selected.  Next week an advertisement will be published in the newspapers and on the Department's website seeking such expressions of interest.  It is likely that the Government will approve a nominee in early September and the Minister will then consult the leaders of the Opposition parties prior to the resolutions been taken before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300060#LLL00500","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Copyright Infringement","time":1374604200,"counter":1002,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300061#MMM00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1374604200,"counter":1003,"content":"<p>Senator Deirdre Clune has also raised this matter.  I am not a fan or an advocate of censorship because I believe a more free and open world will benefit everyone.  I raise this matter because of the recent ruling by the High Court which ordered UPC to block the website <i>The Pirate Bay<\/i>.  This was done at the whim of big business and could be the beginning of a slippery slope.  We do not want to find ourselves in the same position as the Chinese in terms of the so-called great firewall of China where the content available to citizens is highly filtered.  I acknowledge, however, that that is an extreme case.  In Finland Internet censorship began with the very noble premise of blocking child pornography, but very quickly other websites which contained no morally questionable content were being blocked.  Even worse, there is no procedure available for website owners to have their websites unblocked.  If we are to go down this road of censorship, an independent body should be established to review reported websites on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p>  It goes without saying blocking websites should be a last resort and done in the interests of people, not big business.  For example, if a website is found to be hosting copyright material, all other measures such as the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act take-down notice should be exhausted.  It is possible that the people running a website have no idea that such content or material is on it, as may be the case with a public forum.  It makes no sense to block the entire website owing to the actions of a couple of bad actors, particularly when less extreme actions can be taken first.  It should be a transparent process and website owners should be able to appeal to have the block removed if the process is found to be in breach.  It must be ensured only illegal content is blocked, not just ideas or opinions which are controversial.  It should not be the case that secret lists are compiled, with few or no review procedures, and that websites not in breach of any legislation are filtered from the Internet.  <\/p><p>  I await the Minister of State's and the Department's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300061#MMM00300","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1374604200,"counter":1004,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.  I assure her and the House that Ireland subscribes fully to the freedoms, opportunities and the access to information that the Internet provides.  A broad and robust set of measures is in place to preserve these freedoms, including the profound protections given to freedom of speech in both the European Convention on Human Rights and the Constitution.  These can only be breached in very particular circumstances and legally precise and transparent ways.  As such, the measures that allow the State to interfere with the free flow of information over the Internet are precisely defined and can only be used in certain circumstances.<\/p><p>  On the specific issue of copyright, it is the case that the holders of copyright are entitled, by virtue of the protections enjoyed under copyright law, to control the use of these works such as in the case of the right to make copies of the work, to broadcast the work or to disseminate the work on-line.  Copyright law provides for remedies to be taken where copyright infringement is alleged, that is, where acts such as those just outlined take place without the consent of the copyright holder or without any remuneration being given to the holder of the copyright in the works.  Such remedies are mandated by the EU copyright directive dating from 2001.  The European Union (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2012 were signed into law by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, on 29 February 2012.  These regulations are not about censorship but rather responding to the requirements of the EU copyright directive which requires member states to provide that injunctive relief may be sought against intermediaries whose services are being used by a third party to infringe a copyright.  The regulations provide legal clarity and the ability to file for injunctive relief against an intermediary such as an Internet service provider, ISP, in a case where copyright infringement is alleged.  The regulations facilitated the granting of a blocking injunction in the recent High Court case concerning <i>The Pirate Bay<\/i> website as mentioned by the Senator.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the granting of injunctions is not an automatic procedure but must involve a judicial process.  The High Court has drawn significant guidance in this area from case law before the European Court of Justice.  This ensures any remedy provided for must be balanced against a range of competing principles in a manner that is reasonable and proportionate to all concerned, including that the fundamental rights of an ISP's customer must be respected, namely, his or her right to protection of personal data and freedom to receive or impart information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072300061#MMM00400","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1374604200,"counter":1005,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 8.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 24 July 2013.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
