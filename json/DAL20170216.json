Subsequent to events last night and based on the line-up of Ministers in front of us, are we looking at an audition here this morning?<\/p>  <p>  I draw the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, to a commitment the Government made on establishing a commission of inquiry to investigate Project Eagle, from which it seems to be reversing.  As the Minister knows, it was reported in 2015 that Project Eagle, a loan portfolio of 850 properties across Northern Ireland, was sold for &euro;1.6 billion by NAMA.  There is considerable concern that this was not the true value of this amount of property and that the true value was not sought or delivered.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has made some very damning findings in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  There are allegations of political involvement, both in the North and in the South, and representations that favoured one buyer over another, and these have been covered in detail by BBC's \"Spotlight\" programme.  Cerberus, the successful buyer, actually met the Department of Finance before the sale was closed, which I would imagine was completely inappropriate.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to comment on that.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, actually met Cerberus the day before the closure.<\/p>  <p>  There are reports and records of contact between the Minister for Finance and Ministers from Northern Ireland, particularly the then First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, and the then Minister, Mr. Sammy Wilson.  It is alleged also that &pound;7 million was involved in fixing the deal and that it was lodged in an offshore account.  This is now being investigated by an assembly finance committee.<\/p><p> There are allegations that decisions in NAMA were made without adequate notes being taken or proper management of the apparent conflicts of interest.  There was a flawed sales process and an inability on the part of NAMA to show that it got the best value for money for the State.  The sale involved so much money that investigations by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the US Department of Justice are under way.<\/p> <p> The Committee of Public Accounts is finalising a report on the sale as we speak and has been working on that for the past number of months, but the Government committed on an all-party basis to a commission of inquiry into Project Eagle some weeks ago.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has demurred from that commitment because he does not feel that there were adequate grounds for a commission.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister, Deputy Bruton, commit that the Government will establish a commission of inquiry and will he outline the timeline for its terms of reference?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600003#A00200","speaker":"1335","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487246700,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  I was in the House when we established NAMA.  One of the aspects that we took considerable care in ensuring was that there could be no possibility of the Minister for Finance of the day interfering in NAMA's commercial activities.  I was on the Opposition benches at the time and that was written into the law for good reason, namely, to ensure that NAMA was established on an independent basis and would make its own commercial decisions.  That has been the at bedrock of NAMA's operations.  Clearly, this means that the Minister for Finance is completely cut off from the way in which NAMA makes decisions about Cerberus, Project Eagle or any other matter in which it has dealings.  It is important that the House is aware of this important separation.<\/p>  <p>  As to the idea of establishing a commission of investigation, I understand that the Taoiseach met the leaders of the Opposition and it was agreed in principle that such a commission would be established.  As the Deputy averted to, however, we also know that the Committee of Public Accounts is undertaking a report on this issue as a follow-up to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is appropriate that we would hear the outcome of the deliberations of that committee, which is an organ of this House, before we make a decision in plenary on the terms of reference and the appropriate scope of any commission of investigation.  That is the approach that is being taken and it is wholly appropriate.

That does not suggest to me that the Minister is \"completely cut off\".  The question is one of whether NAMA delivered the best return possible on taxpayers' money.  In the view of the Comptroller and Auditor General, our spending watchdog, it did not.  The notion that the Minister could be cut off fails in that instance.  In fact, taxpayers have been failed.  We need answers.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the  commitment by the Minister, Deputy Bruton that the commission will be established.

Its decisions and decision-making process are what are under scrutiny, as the Deputy rightly recognised.  The Minister for Finance has not been involved in that decision-making process, either about the selection of tenderers or any of the other matters about which the Comptroller and Auditor General has raised questions.<\/p>  <p>  The issue that is before the Committee of Public Accounts is whether the approach taken by NAMA was adequate.

The Government has now survived a motion of no confidence.  In whatever time it has left, it is important that the Government focuses on some of the crucial issues on which it promised clear action.  A new report was published on the private rental sector this week.  It showed the largest yearly increase in rents across the country since these records began in 2002.  The report from property website<i>Daft.ie<\/i>covered the 2016 calendar year.  During that year, rents rose by an extraordinary 13.5%.  As the Minister well knows, increases of this magnitude put unbearable pressure on families.  They make it harder, if not impossible, for people to buy their own homes.  Broken down, these figures show 14.5% increases in Dublin and 12% hikes in Cork.  Even outside the so-called pressure areas, we saw rises of 12.5% in rents in Limerick and 10.7% in Waterford.  My colleague and our housing spokesperson, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has called on the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, to consider including these in the so-called pressure zones.  Of course, he has refused.  The Government is basically telling people in Limerick and Waterford that it will do nothing to halt the galloping rents that they are now finding unaffordable.<\/p><p>Even if that were the only issue, it would be strong and sufficient evidence for new action.  However, another worrying aspect highlighted in the <i>Daft.ie<\/i>report is that there is now a critical supply issue.  The number of homes available to rent at the start of this month was just 4,000.  We need a rapid increase in the availability of housing and the supply solution.  In the meanwhile, is the Government willing to accept that the rental strategy it set out to this House is not fit for purpose?  Is it not now clear that formal rent control, for which we have advocated for some time and for which my colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly, has advocated for a protracted period of time, is the only policy that will have a real impact on the galloping rent increases?  Will the Minister confirm his agreement to revisit the whole issue of formal national rent control now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600007#E00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1487248500,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I believe the real solution to this is increased supply.  That is the real focus of the approach that the Government has been taking.  It is about real supply coming from social housing.  For the first time, we have committed to 47,000 new builds of social housing after a period in which there was virtually no social housing constructed, which created huge imbalances in the marketplace.<\/p>  <p>  We also have to get private sector building going as well.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has created a whole range of initiatives to move that along using council and publicly-owned land to open up new opportunities for affordable housing, starter homes and social housing.  That work is in progress.  I believe it is encouraging to see in the reports that the Minister has published this week on the progress that has been made that there is a very strong growth in, for example, housing starts, which is an early indicator of the success of the strategy he is pursuing.  We will have to see that materialise in completions in due course but I believe there are strong indications that we are seeing a revival of activity in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has recognised that there are pressures in the rental market as a result of that lack of supply.  That is why he has introduced for a period a cap on rents.  That cap provides that there can be only a 4% increase in rents.  It also provides that there is a restriction on those who have not had increases for a number of years.  Landlords cannot leapfrog rents to increase them in big amounts.  Those caps are just coming into force now.  We look forward to seeing the rental figures in the future impacted by those decisions.  In terms of extending that to other areas, the Minister has indicated that there is an approach to extending it.  It will be based on an analysis of the actual marketplace situation in each location.  The Minister is fully open to looking at new areas.<\/p><p>As of the date he produced the order in December, Dublin and Cork clearly met that criteria but there is a further group coming up behind those cities, and I have no doubt other areas will be subjected to such caps also if that is established.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600007#E00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487248800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The Minister's answer is not good enough.

We do not want a protracted process that involves only people affected now in Dublin and Cork.

Most of them have been on the treatment for up to a decade and fear a rapid deterioration if the drug is no longer available.  An application to have the treatment, which costs more than &euro;100,000 per patient but is provided free of charge, has been rejected by the HSE drugs group.<\/p><p>I want to compliment the Alpha One Foundation, which runs a HSE-funded screening programme in Beaumont Hospital in Dublin.  It has said that the treatment has been life-changing for patients.  I compliment people such as Professor McElvaney and others who have been doing great work for the patients who suffer from this most severe of diseases.<\/p><p>I know about this disease first hand, being a very close friend of a patient who has been suffering with it for many years and who relies on this life-saving drug.  Some people have another condition, panniculitis, which is combined with the emphysema problem I have highlighted.  If this drug is taken from them, they will slowly fade away.<\/p><p>This Government, the Department of Health, and the Minister, who is sitting beside the Minister, Deputy Bruton, should get on to the drugs companies providing this drug.  For God's sake, we are not talking about an unimportant issue.  We are talking about a drug that will save people's lives.  It is saving their lives.  It is keeping them alive.  If the drug is taken from them, the immediate effect will be that they will lose the power in their legs, they will not be able to breath and will have to fight for every breath.  The money for this drug has to be provided but the drugs companies have to be tackled also.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister for Health in particular to go to them, sit down with them and tell them that for God's sake on compassionate grounds they should reduce the cost so the HSE will be able to continue to provide this lifesaving drug.  I know people who are at home today and who have already heard Professor McElvaney and others discussing the drug on Radio One this morning.  They will also hear it being spoken about here, but what we want to hear from the Minister and the Government is that they will help these people.

I understand the patients have what is described as compassionate access to the drug but the company appears to be suggesting this will be withdrawn from them.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has a process for deciding what drugs are supplied with the public paying for them.  These decisions are made entirely independently of the political process.  There is an independent process which I understand is not complete, and whether the drug in question should be supported will go to the HSE's management committee for a decision.  It makes its decisions on independent assessment of the impact versus the cost.  We have seen previously that companies have been looking for exorbitant costs for some medication.  The Minister has taken initiatives with other colleagues in other countries, including the UK, Scotland and Australia, to seek to ensure all health patients on public lists get access to medication on fair terms.  This is where the issue rests.<\/p>  <p>  In the same report mentioned by the Deputy, I saw the HSE needs more cost-effective pricing from a company to ensure the drug can be made available to public patients.  I appeal to the company to ensure the pricing of such products, which can transform people's lives, is set at a reasonable level so public patients, whether here or in other countries, can gain access to them.  The Government has sought to deal with this national issue, but in terms of individual products it is down to the HSE to make that decision.

As well as the approximately 20 patients on the access programme another 40 people with alpha 1 are waiting to receive it should the HSE give approval.  I make this plea in the House.  This involves the small number of 20 people, but this is how they have been living in recent months: they are only told this month whether they are approved for next month.  It is literally like being told, \"We are not sure yet whether we will allow you to have a proper quality of life or whether you will start to slowly die\".  This is an awful thing to have to say about these people, but it is how they are being treated.  I beg the Minister for Health to give these people certainty today.  Sit down with the drugs companies, call them to order and ask them to have sense.  They have a public and moral responsibility to help these poor people.  I am not fighting with the Minister, but I am asking him to tackle this work please.

If it gives access to a life-transforming product it should sustain it for those people in a pilot programme.  Of course there are issues on the wider front, regarding the HSE deciding on the efficacy of the drug and the possibility of extending it to a much wider number of patients.<\/p><p>That has substantial economic cost.

Of course, we will refine it over time.  Anyone who feels a case has not been fairly assessed can look for a review of the selection.  I recognise that what we are doing here is selecting the schools with the greatest needs.  These 80 schools are the ones which were identified as having the greatest needs.  That is where my resources are going.  I assure the House that I am committed to continuing to improve the way we deploy resources to assist the children with the greatest need in our schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600012#K00900","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1487250900,"counter":84,"content":"<p>The programme for Government states that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must have the modern technology and resources to detect and investigate crimes.

Media and broadcasting personnel,<br \/><br \/>&mdash; members of the Government,<br \/><br \/>&mdash; TUSLA,<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Health Service Executive,<br \/><br \/>&mdash; any other State entities,&mdash; or any relevant person as the Sole Member may deem necessary to carry out his work;<br \/><br \/>relevant to the matters set out in [a], [b], [c], [d], [e] and [f] above.<br \/><br \/>[i] To examine all records relating to the telecommunications interactions used by Superintendent Taylor, former Commissioner Callinan and Commissioner O&rsquo;Sullivan, in the period from the 1st of July, 2012, to the 31st of May, 2014, to ascertain whether there are any records of text messages or other telecommunication interactions relating to the matters set out at [a], [b], [c], [d], [e] and [f] above and to examine and consider the content of any such text messages or other telecommunication interactions.<br \/><br \/>[j] To examine all electronic and paper files, relating to Sergeant Maurice McCabe held by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to consider any material therein relevant to [a], [b], [c], [d], [e] and [f] above.<br \/><br \/>[k] To investigate whether Commissioner O&rsquo;Sullivan, using briefing material prepared in Garda Headquarters, influenced or attempted to influence broadcasts on RT&Eacute;

The resolutions, which accompany this statement, must now be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The terms of reference for the tribunal of inquiry are comprehensive and clear in their focus.  Mr. Justice Peter Charleton will chair the tribunal and is available to begin work this week.  I thank him for taking on this role.  <\/p><p>There has been much debate and discussion in this House about the best way to establish the truth in these matters.  I thank the Members for their genuine engagement to identify the key issues that should be included.  What is now proposed reflects those discussions and the information put Into the public domain last week.  These terms of reference will establish a public tribunal of inquiry get to the truth.  That is in the interests of whistleblowers and the interests of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly those against whom allegations have been made, and it is in the public interest.  What is required is that the issue of how whistleblowers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been treated is examined independently, fairly and publicly.  For the first time, we will hear in public all sides of the story.  I have said to this House previously that it would be wrong to try to remedy one injustice by creating another one.  Everyone has basic human rights and it would be a cruel irony if our beliefs about the appalling treatment of some led to the ill- treatment of others.  Hearing the other side is a basic requirement of fair procedure.<\/p><p>I will now turn to the terms of reference themselves.  The tribunal will, of course, look at the matters originally recommended by Mr Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill.  I am in Mr Justice O'Neill's debt.  We discussed them here in detail last Thursday.  I thank him for the work he did and I thank Mr. Justice Charleton for his willingness to serve as the chairman of the tribunal.  The original recommendation was for a commission of investigation.  The terms of reference now contains specific references to the contacts between garda&iacute;, Tusla, the Health Service Executive and other agencies regarding Sergeant McCabe.  While allegations which were put into the public domain about Garda Keith Harrison, Tusla and Garda Harrison's general treatment were different, nevertheless, because of concerns expressed to me by quite a number of Deputies, I have included contacts between garda&iacute; and Tusla in the first module.  In the light of specific concerns which have arisen, the tribunal will look at whether there is a pattern relating to Tusla files and their use to discredit Garda whistleblowers.  Many Deputies felt it was important to examine whether a pattern existed.  People have said that a pattern might have existed because there are two known cases so that is part of the terms of reference.  <\/p><p>The tribunal will now also look at certain matters relating to the O'Higgins commission.  It will also took at whether senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na attempted to entrap or falsely accuse Sergeant McCabe of criminal misconduct.  There has been a lot of debate in this House and elsewhere as to whether we should look at how other garda&iacute; who have made protected disclosures have been treated.  I am providing for a new module which will allow the tribunal to look at these cases in the context of action to target or discredit Garda&iacute; who had made protected disclosures.  GSOC will continue its work regarding complaints outside of these.  There is a provision that Mr. Justice Charleton may consult with me if another judge may be needed to deal with the second module.  The priority will be dealing with the issues arising in the first module.  We are specifically providing that the tribunal can look at contacts between members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and any other relevant person that the tribunal may deem necessary.  I want to put it on the record of the House that this would include Members of the Oireachtas.  Mr. Justice Charleton will decide on what is seen as relevant.  Quite a number of people mentioned this as well.  <\/p><p>I know Mr. Justice Charleton is anxious to commence his work immediately and is determined to carry it our as expeditiously as possible.  Once the resolution is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas today, I intend to make the necessary statutory instrument so his work can start immediately.  That work will report to this D&aacute;il.  I look forward to the recommendations Mr. Justice Charleton will make and I look forward to the truth.  We have already made extensive reforms relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The reality is that more cultural change is needed in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because reform can never stop.  We will now also have the benefit of advice from an international independent policing expert.  I want to make it clear that this work will complement the work of GSOC, the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate, which have all done and are doing very important jobs in this country.  <\/p><p>I will now refer to the six questions contained in the McCabe's statement relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to which they understandably want answers.As I have already said in the House, I want to facilitate them as much as possible but I do not want to pretend to the House that this matter is completely straightforward in circumstances where a tribunal is being established.  Having consulted with the Attorney General, the Secretary General of my Department has written to the Garda Commissioner in accordance with<\/p><p>section 40 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act and the power I have under that requesting the information sought in the six questions.<\/p><p>I expect that it will be necessary to consult further with the Attorney General once the Commissioner has replied.<br\/><br\/> Our action today will ensure that any wrongdoing around the issues we have been discussing here within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be addressed fully and fairly.  I believe that is what Deputies across this House want to see.  I believe the terms of reference I am putting forward today will enable the judge to do just that.  As I have said before in this House, I have always been careful and scrupulous to deal with all the cases that have come to my attention.  I have already put it on the record of the House that I do not have the authority to investigate protected disclosures coming from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is the role of GSOC.  I have always made the case, publicly and privately, in all of my dealings, for example, with Garda management, that whistleblowers should be protected and supported.  For example, my own bona fides on this could be seen when I referred the charter for police policies on whistleblowing to the independent Policing Authority to examine it and come back to me with recommendations.<br\/><br\/>This tribunal will ensure justice for Sergeant McCabe, his family and all parties involved.  That is what is important.  I ask Deputies across the House for support for this motion.  I believe that it is thorough in its terms of reference that I put before the House today.  I have been able to include the vast majority of issues that have been brought to my attention and the key points that have been made to me by Deputies.  It also includes all of the recommendations that Mr. Justice O'Neill made that we discussed here last week.  I believe there is general agreement that it is important to continue to include those recommendations from the judge, which I followed in full.  I have extended them to deal with the issues that I have spoken about this afternoon.  I commend this motion to the House and I am sure all Members of the House will join with me in wishing Mr. Justice Charleton well in his task of great importance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600020#S00200","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487255100,"counter":114,"content":"<p>We will be supporting the motion.  If both Houses support this resolution, this State will establish a tribunal of inquiry for the thirty-first time since the foundation of the State.  Of those 31 tribunals of inquiry, it is interesting to note that six of them have been into activities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In fairness to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, seven of them have been into the activities of politicians.  Therefore, garda&iacute; do not head that league table.<\/p>  <p>  Although tribunals of inquiry fulfil very important tasks, it is important to note that they do not administer justice.  We need to look to see what the background was to the establishment of tribunals of inquiry.  The Act was enacted in 1921 because a Member of Parliament made allegations against a Minister.  He wanted them investigated.  He did not want them investigated by a parliamentary committee because he wanted the witnesses to be able to take the oath.  As a result, the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 was enacted.  That is the Act that forms the basis for the resolution that we are seeking to pass today.  In passing, I wish to note a comment made by Deputy Pearse Doherty a number of days ago when he referred to the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill, which was instituted in 2005 and was at Report Stage in 2011.  I believe it would be beneficial if we proceeded to enact it.  However, it will not be possible to enact it prior to the passing of this resolution.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the function of a tribunal is to establish the truth.  What we are doing is asking Mr. Justice Charleton to look at the facts, hear the evidence and come back with a report telling us what he views as being the truth.  It is not the function of a tribunal to apportion criminal liability.  If people think that there is going to be a finding of criminal wrongdoing or an imposition of a sanction against an individual as a result of the inquiry at the end of this process, that is not going to happen.  It is also not the case that there are going to be any civil findings requiring an individual to pay damages to another individual.  That is not the function of a tribunal.  It is the function of the courts.  I know that we criticise tribunals in this House are perfectly entitled to do so.  However, we create them and we have a responsibility to try to ensure that they are efficient and not as costly as they have been in the past.<\/p>  <p>  The most important issue when it comes to the efficiency of a tribunal of inquiry is the setting of its terms of reference.  Some terms of reference in the past have been exceptionally broad and have led to those tribunals continuing for a very long period of time.  I believe that the terms of reference that have been put forward by the T&aacute;naiste with the assistance of other Members of the House are very appropriate.  I believe they cover what is required.  They are issues that should enable this tribunal to conclude its business in a prompt period of time.<\/p>  <p>  I believe it would be helpful to quickly go through the individual terms of reference.  Paragraphs [a] and [b] are paragraphs that were recommended by Mr. Justice O'Neill.  Paragraph [c] is a proposed amendment that I raised in the House last Thursday and I am glad to see that the T&aacute;naiste has accepted it.  Paragraph [d] is a more specific version of paragraph [c] since it relates to the creation, distribution and use by Tusla of the file of which we became aware.  Paragraph [e] asks the tribunal of inquiry to look into certain actions of the commission of investigation.  It is worthwhile to note that we are asking a tribunal of inquiry to investigate some aspects of a commission of investigation.  However, it is very limited to see whether or not false allegations or other unjustified grounds were knowingly used at the commission of investigation to discredit Sergeant McCabe.  I believe the transcripts of the commission of investigation would be helpful to the tribunal.  For the purposes of this, I assume that section 45 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 will apply and that the tribunal will be able to access those transcripts.<\/p>  <p>  Paragraph [f] determines whether or not there was any plan to entrap or falsely accuse Sergeant McCabe.  There were some broad allegations in respect of that.  Paragraph [g] was in Mr. Justice O'Neill's report, as was paragraph [h], although we have added to it \"members of the Government\".  I note that it has also been increased to include Tusla and the HSE.  Paragraphs [i] and [j] were in Mr. Justice O'Neill's initial proposed terms of reference, as was paragraph [k].  I note that the Government changed some of the wording in paragraph [k], which concerns the national broadcaster.  The words \"planned and orchestrated\" have been replaced with the words \"influenced or attempted to influence\".  I believe that is probably a sensible change.  It broadens it out and makes it viable.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to the issue of time at this tribunal, one of the areas in which it may get into lengthy issues that could delay it concerns the area of journalistic privilege.  I believe that is something to be noted.  A very important factor, other than the terms of reference, concerns the cost of tribunals.  We need to ensure that the State plays a role in order that the cost does not run inordinately high.  We can do that by getting the State to inform parties beforehand that when they apply for representation, they must do so in the knowledge that their costs will only tax at a certain amount.  If somebody is not satisfied with that, they can agree to pay their lawyers more or they can get other lawyers.  It is important at the outset that the State says publicly to people seeking representation that there will only be a certain amount for representation and that the costs will be taxed at that amount.<\/p>  <p>  The process of a tribunal is effective in itself.  People are brought before it.  We will see in public the superintendent, the sergeant, the Commissioner and the former Commissioner give evidence.  Their evidence will be given in public.  It will be tested.  The tribunal will test it and antagonists will be able to test it.  Nobody goes into a tribunal with special treatment.  I would suggest that it is not going to be a very pleasant experience for anyone, but the objective of it is to procure and establish the truth.  The public issues and disquiet that have been revealed require that the truth is established.  I wish Mr. Justice Charleton well in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of this process, all we will have is a report.  In years to come, people in this House should not criticise Mr. Justice Charleton for that fact that all we got out the tribunal was a report.  That is all we are asking him to do and all he can do.  It is not for us to direct criminal prosecutions or civil liability cases.<\/p><p>However, on the production of that report, it may be the case that other individuals such as other prosecuting authorities or investigating authorities might be able to use it as a roadmap if wrongdoing is revealed.  Obviously, it can never be used as evidence.<\/p> <p> In terms of one or two other matters, sometimes tribunals of inquiry are also played out in the media.  Parties frequently like to get information out in the public domain before individuals give evidence before the tribunal.  It would be preferable in this case if we allowed the tribunal hear all the evidence without any party trying to influence the outcome.  Let every person go before the tribunal, give their evidence and let there be a conclusion by the judge at the end of it.<\/p> <p> It is important to note also that sometimes tribunals can be very demanding on people who hold positions in high office.  We saw that in our own party when a Taoiseach was before a tribunal of inquiry.  However, the fact that one holds office does not mean that one cannot give evidence before a tribunal and continue in one's job.  I refer to that because of the calls upon the Garda Commissioner.  The Garda Commissioner has denied any wrongdoing.  It is important that we deal with her issues promptly so that the public can see what is the situation and that a report can be produced.<\/p> <p> I want to make another point about the politicisation of calls for a Garda Commissioner to be removed.  It is part of politics in this House that people call for politicians to resign, whether they are Ministers, Ministers of State or whoever.  As Members of this House we have to be careful that we do not bring into that group people on the outside who hold important jobs such as the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, the director general of RTE or the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We must ensure that we do not politicise those offices by having parties in this House calling for their heads when other parties in the House are not calling for that.  That will damage the institutions they serve.<\/p> <p> It is very important that we try to re-establish public trust in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That trust exists but, unquestionably, it has been damaged by the revelations over the past while.  The important function of this tribunal is to try to establish the truth.  It is in the public interest for wrongdoing to be disclosed.  If there is no wrongdoing it is also in the public interest for that to be disclosed as well.<\/p> <p> I wish Mr. Justice Charlton well in the task he has to do.  He should be given the opportunity to do it without background noise from politicians or from the parties affected by the tribunal.  Ultimately, we will have a report, and I believe the report will be to the benefit of Irish society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600021#T00200","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487255700,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Jonathan O'Brien who I understand is sharing time with Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600022#U00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1487255700,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Deputy Pearse Doherty will take one or two minutes also.<\/p>  <p>  I will get directly to the point.  Yesterday, we met with the Minister and brought to her seven separate proposals in terms of the changes we would like to see made.  I am glad to say that six of those proposals have been taken on board in some capacity.  There was an issue around the wording, and the Minister committed to do her best to try to include it.<\/p>  <p>  We mentioned to the Minister yesterday the possibility of including other whistleblowers in a way that would not delay the initial focus of the inquiry, which was Maurice McCabe and now Keith Harrison.  I am glad to say that paragraph [p] now allows for that to happen.  The fact that we are now introducing modules will allow for the initial public inquiry into the allegations and the cases of Keith Harrison and Maurice McCabe to be dealt with.  There is a timeframe on an interim report of three months, which is less than what we had suggested to the Minister.  We suggested a timeframe of four months so we welcome that.  If the cases of other whisleblowers need to be examined, there is scope within the terms of reference for the judge to request an additional module.<\/p>  <p>  One of the other issues we asked the Minister to examine was the possibility, and we raised it last week, of including Members of the Oireachtas.  I know that wording it in that way was somewhat problematic but under paragraph [h] the Minister has been able to achieve that where she states \"or any relevant person as the Sole Member may deem necessary to carry out his work\".  I believe that covers any Member of the Oireachtas.  We had also asked that Tusla and the Health Service Executive would be named in the terms of reference and we are glad to see that has been done.<\/p>  <p>  The other areas we wanted included, as I am sure did other Deputies, was to determine if there was evidence to indicate a pattern in terms of the way whistleblowers were being discredited and allegations were being made about them.  That is included in paragraph [o], which is to investigate any pattern of the creation and distribution of Tusla files.  My only concern about that is that it is narrowed to the use of Tusla files.  I would have liked it to be extended to include whether there was a pattern regarding the use of media to discredit whistleblowers but, unfortunately, we have not been able to work that into the terms.  I understand the reason for that, namely, that we wanted to keep the terms of reference as narrow possible but I would have liked to determine if there was a pattern in terms of the use of the media, and not just Tusla, to discredit whistleblowers.<\/p>  <p>  Only one of our proposals was not included, and we discussed this with the Minister yesterday.  We had asked that the judge would be given the power to examine the protected disclosures, the way the procedures and protocols are working and whether he would recommend changes.  The Minister agreed at our meeting yesterday that that is a piece of work we should probably undertake and gave a commitment that it is something we would like to undertake.  It comes under the office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister has given a commitment to discuss that with him.  We would be eager to see that piece of work being done.  I do not see any reason it cannot happen in tandem with the public inquiry.  I understand the reason it is not referred to in the terms of reference but the Minister gave a commitment on it.<\/p>  <p>  There is an issue around the costs.  My colleague, Deputy Doherty, will speak about that but we have to recognise that when a tribunal of inquiry is set up, one of the major criticisms from the public, and even from Members of this House, is the cost of it.  We believe there is a solution to that but it might mean holding back on agreeing the terms of reference until next week.  I am not suggesting we should do that but it might be something the Minister would consider.  We could look at bringing in emergency legislation, but I will allow Deputy Doherty to discuss that.  My colleague, Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, will speak also.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, we are satisfied with the terms of reference.  We believe they will achieve what we hope to achieve and we will support them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600022#U00300","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1487255700,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I will make a couple of points.  Gene Kerrigan, in a tweet about the smearing of Maurice McCabe, stated, &quot;Of all the files in all the world, a serious allegation accidentally falls into the file labelled Sgt McCabe&quot;.  We know that the Director of Public Prosecutions decided there was insufficient evidence to proceed to a court case regarding the initial allegation made against Maurice McCabe.  Dozens, if not hundreds, of allegations fail to proceed past the DPP; they are usually the end of allegations.  However, that was not so in this case.  We know that Paul Williams decided to focus on this particular case and wrote articles in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>subsequent to the decision of the DPP.  Paul Williams then wrote that Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin decided to meet with the originator of the allegations and, as a result, Deputy Martin decided to send the allegations to the Taoiseach.  I understand Paul Williams also wrote to the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach then decided to hold an investigation into these particular cases.<\/p><p>We have a case that failed to make it past the DPP, like hundreds of others, but this is different.  The largest newspaper in the country takes a special interest in it, the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il meets with the persons who made the allegations, and the Taoiseach states that he will investigate the case.  What elevates this case beyond all others that failed to make it past the DPP?<\/p><p>Maurice McCabe is a target of the allegation within the case.  Smears need vectors.  Some of these vectors are people who were used and some of them are people who use others.  We need to make sure these relationships are properly investigated.  My major worry in this is there are journalists who feel they have valuable information to offer to the tribunal but they know if they break cover or provide the information they may never work again.  The key questions for me are how we ensure these journalists feel comfortable in providing this information and how we protect them in this scenario.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600022#U00400","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487256300,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I welcome the terms of reference.  It is worth saying again that in the past week Maurice McCabe and Katie Hannon have done the State a great service because now we have before us far more robust terms of reference, and a tribunal of inquiry as opposed to a commission of investigation with limited terms of reference.  I am very satisfied to see Keith Harrison being named in module one with regard to the connection with Tusla, and he will also be encompassed in the second module.  The original claims by those whistleblowers also need to be investigated robustly.<\/p>  <p>  I want to focus on what I have been doing for quite a number of years with regard to the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005.  It is wrong for us to proceed to establish a tribunal under the 1921 Act.  We all know that legislation is flawed in the area of costs.  The Law Reform Commission has produced a comprehensive report in this area.  We have a Bill which deals with limiting the costs of tribunals of investigation which was approved by the Attorney General back in 2005 and which passed Second and Committee Stages.  Elements of the Bill should not progress, but the core part of it on the reduction of costs of tribunals of inquiry must pass before we establish this inquiry.  Do I want to stall in any way this tribunal of inquiry being established?  No, I do not, but do we have an ability in this House and the Seanad to introduce that part of the 2005 Bill in the next week?  Yes, we do.  It would allow the sole member of the tribunal of inquiry to tell each witness the amount for which they would be covered for legal costs.  No longer would we have witnesses coming in with five barristers and two junior counsels looking to recoup their costs from the State.  It would be the judge who would decide what is appropriate for legal representation to be paid by the State.  No longer would public relations consultants be allowed to be hired by witnesses and have their costs paid by the State.  It would allow the Minister to set regulations to cap the amount paid for legal representation.  We have the ability to do this.  It is very simple.  We have rushed through legislation in the past.  The Taoiseach said to me earlier today he has requested a report on the issues I have raised.  I ask the Minister, as we agree the terms of reference in the House, to consider bringing forward emergency legislation to deal with specific parts of the 2005 Bill and have them passed by the House.  Sinn F&eacute;in will fully co-operate with the Minister, whether additional sittings, extra time or clearing schedules next week are necessary, to have it passed in this House and in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600023#V00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1487256300,"counter":121,"content":"<p>The events that have led us to this point have exposed society in a way few other issues could have done.  All of this began with the relatively low-key efforts of a decent man who wanted to highlight wrongdoing in our police force.  That the situation has been allowed to escalate to a point where we are once again establishing a tribunal of inquiry is astonishing.  The series of events have been a squalid affair. A man and his family have been subjected to a campaign of utterly false and damaging allegations.  As my colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly, and others have highlighted, it appears he is not the only one to have been subjected to such a campaign.<\/p>  <p>  Public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has once more been undermined.  The very many honourable men and women working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to keep our society safe have had the integrity of their work undermined.  A new agency created to better protect the children of Ireland from harm has had its reputation sullied.  Questions once more arise as to how Ireland works to keep our children safe.  These events are really damaging.  They reveal dysfunction and worse that reaches across the fundamental pillars of a functioning State.  Two of the most important institutions required to keep our people safe are damaged and the contagion has spread far beyond those bodies.  Public administration, politics and the media have all been called into serious question.<\/p>  <p>  Here we are once more creating a tribunal of inquiry.  We could recite off the list of reforming legislation passed in recent years, much of it promoted by my party to restore public confidence in this country and its institutions.  Those of us with long enough experience might wonder realistically what impact the legislation has made.  We might wonder whether we have learned anything at all about real implementation of effective systems to ensure openness and accountability in the conduct of public life.  This is Groundhog Day as much of what we have witnessed will bring us all back to other events.  What is required is deep introspection from us all as to what it says about aspects of society.<\/p>  <p>  I remember the Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats tribunals of inquiry Bill referenced by previous speakers.  It was described as a consolidation and reforming measure with a view to putting in place a modern comprehensive statutory framework governing all aspects of a tribunal from the time of its establishment to the publication of the final report.  What was most important was that the Bill, if passed into law, would have enabled the Government, with the approval of the Houses, to dissolve a tribunal and wind up its inquiry before it was completed.  The then Minister, of course, was right to complain about spiralling costs, but the motivation at that time was to give power to the House and its majority Government to collapse inquiries.  The then Minister was entitled to say that at some stage we have to ask ourselves whether it is worthwhile proceeding any further in the circumstances and that we cannot go on forever, but the upshot of it was that when the Bill collapsed we lost the opportunity to control legal costs properly and properly punish time wasting and non-co-operation by witnesses under investigation.  I agree with the views of others that we need to revisit the Bill, but not the motivation, in my judgment, of the part of it that wanted to collapse inquiries midstream.  Legitimate concerns have been raised about costs.  Some of these have been overstated.  The commission of investigation model was intended to be a cheaper option, with a greatly reduced role for legal counsel.  In reality, as we saw in the O'Higgins commission, multiple teams of lawyers were often present.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for meeting me yesterday and for producing terms of reference which I believe encompass the issues I have raised.  I wish Mr. Justice Charleton well.  I hope his ambition to complete his work within the reasonable timeframe he has set out becomes a reality.  The functioning of our State requires this.  I expect his investigation will deliver a vindication to people whom the State has maligned.  In darkness and shadows campaigns of vilification have been conducted.  Perhaps the most important aspect of what we debate here today is that Mr. Justice Charleton will carry out his work in the clear light of day.<\/p>  <p>  I have a question for the T&aacute;naiste to which I hope she can respond.  Will she confirm to the House that she has already issued or, if not, that she will issue later today a directive to the Garda Commissioner under section 25 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to secure the preservation of all Garda records and equipment that may well be relevant to the inquiry and safeguard all evidence?  As we embark upon yet another inquiry into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I hope truly meaningful reforms and, what is more important, cultural change will finally begin to take root.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600023#V00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1487256900,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I also welcome the terms of reference which have been agreed and announced today.  It has been a long week since my colleague, Deputy Howlin, made his statement in the D&aacute;il.  Many criticised him but that triggered the events which brought us to where we are now.  My colleague acknowledged the work of everyone in the House and certain journalists but we would not be where we are today if he had not spoken.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the considerable movement in the past couple of days and even hours.  The terms of reference are divided into two segments.  The first module will deal with the disclosures of Sergeant McCabe and Superintendent Taylor and, thanks to the work of a number of people, those of Garda Keith Harrison, for which I also campaigned vigorously.  There are similarities between his case and the others in the form of the role of Tusla and how he, Marissa and their family were treated but it would be impossible not to deal with how he was dealt with by garda&iacute;.  I seek an assurance that all his issues will be dealt with as part of this process because it would be impossible to separate them.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality has now learned a unique lesson.  It never wanted multiple whistleblowers' claims to be dealt with together in any inquiry or tribunal because to do so would show a pattern, a culture and similarities in the disclosures of numerous whistleblowers.  It will give evidence to the people of Ireland of behaviour which is disgraceful.  We also need to ensure that there is criminal sanction for wrongdoing.  Today may not be the day to deal with that but we will have to come back to it. <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the terms of reference cover all other whistleblowers as this is a very important facet of the inquiry, which will bring justice for the State and all the whistleblowers.  While many whistleblowers will be covered by this inquiry, their daily circumstances are very different.  Some are on pay; some are not.  Some live on social welfare and there are many other issues.  I urge the T&aacute;naiste to look at the fact that some are being treated differently from others and that there is no consistency of treatment.<\/p>  <p>  I thank those in this House who worked to ensure the terms of reference were broadened.  Sergeant McCabe issued a statement a number of days ago asking whether Ministers in this or the previous Government were briefed, formally or informally, on allegations against him.

After the despicable treatment, the vilification and intimidation of the orchestrated campaign against them, perhaps now they will find justice and full vindication and those responsible for the campaign against them can be brought to justice.  I certainly hope so.<\/p>  <p>  They have shown bravery and determination but Maurice McCabe said today that if he had to go through it all again he might not do so.  That is a very chilling thing because if one of the most heroic whistleblowers says he is not sure he would do it again it is a damning indictment of the State, the political system, the police and, indeed, our legislation on protected disclosures and tribunals and the encouragement given by this House to people to blow the whistle on wrongdoing in important institutions.  We have a heavy responsibility to make sure this tribunal delivers justice for the individual whistleblowers and cleans out the rotten culture that appears to exist at the highest levels of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as in other State and non-State bodies that may have colluded in the despicable campaign of vilification and character assassination to defend practices that breached the standards An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is supposed to uphold.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate the tributes to Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly, who have doggedly pursued this matter from the outset, despite attempts to impugn their characters.  It seems to be a standard feature of the way the State and the system respond to political or other whistleblowers that the first line of defence is to attack the whistleblower.<\/p><p>Hopefully, however, we are moving beyond that.<\/p> <p> While some journalists should be commended for the role they have played in bringing us towards the truth of these matters, particularly Michael Clifford and Katie Hannon in recent times, I would make a point about others.  We have had serious allegations that members of the media may also have been involved in recycling the malicious rumours against Maurice McCabe.  That is a very serious issue that has to be got to the bottom of.  Over the last week or so, the tendency to try to move an issue which should have been about Maurice McCabe, the treatment of whistleblowers and the issues they were trying to uncover, as well as the need to ensure that we root out any corruption and malpractice in the Garda, too often slid into a political debate and a ding-dong between political parties.  It was a debate, often encouraged by the media, about who was going to be Taoiseach, who would be in government and whether it would lead to an election.  It should be about the issues, however.<\/p> <p> I think the terms of reference are comprehensive.  I hope they will get justice for the whistleblowers but let us hope that we will also learn the political lessons from the debacle that has led us to this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600024#W00600","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487257500,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that we are going to have a public tribunal of inquiry into this matter.  Thanks for that go to Maurice McCabe and the other whistleblowers who must be commended for speaking out in the face of everything that has been thrown at them precisely for speaking out.  What will be uncovered is only a glimpse of the dark underbelly of the State and how it can be used in such a way as to destroy people who pose a threat to those at the very top.  It will raise the need for a much broader public inquiry involving those who are victims of injustice and looking into what has been the role of the State in our society.  How have they managed to protect those at the very top and what is the relationship between them and members of the media?<\/p>  <p>  The timing of this debate is somewhat unfortunate.  It would have been much better, and still would be, if we could have some time over the weekend to consider this and vote on it next Tuesday, instead of doing it now.  I do not understand what the rush is for in that respect.<\/p>  <p>  I want to respond to a point raised by Deputy O'Callaghan that it is not appropriate for political parties, unless they all agree, to call for the Garda Commissioner to resign.  I do not agree.  I note that Senator Michael McDowell, a former Minister for Justice, called in the Seanad today for her to go.  I just do not think it is credible that we are agreeing to set up a public inquiry into allegations that the Garda Commissioner conducted and orchestrated the blackest propaganda against members of her own police force, yet we are going to leave her in place where she could potentially play a role in obstructing the tribunal.<\/p>  <p>  The existence of a tribunal cannot be used as an excuse to avoid answering Maurice McCabe's six questions now or as quickly as possible.  Nor can it be used to avoid criminal prosecutions which are needed.  It cannot be that in a year's time we will have another tribunal report sitting on the DPP's desk gathering dust, and no prosecutions.  If what is alleged is accurate, as I believe it is, prosecutions should follow.<\/p>  <p>  The costs of the tribunal have to be closely monitored, restricted and not allowed to balloon out of control so we do not have a situation of creating yet more millionaires from a tribunal.  Similarly, the timing has to be watched.<\/p>  <p>  We are moving three separate amendments although they are listed as one.  Amendments Nos. 2(a) and (b) constitute one amendment, while amendment Nos. 2(c) and 2(d) are the second and third ones.  They should be taken separately because that is how they were submitted.<\/p>  <p>  We are seeking to delete the words \"to ensure public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\" in the seventh paragraph.  We do not think public confidence in the institution of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is warranted.  I do not think the tribunal should have a pre-ordained outcome that it will restore public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In fact, I think it is going to reduce public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and will open a debate in society about what kind of police force we have and the need for a police force to be democratically accountable and controlled by the communities it is meant to serve. <\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 2(b) seeks to emphasise the point \"that evidence obtained during the inquiry can be used in criminal prosecutions\".<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 2(c) seeks to broaden the current reference to \"members of the Government\" to read \"members and former members of the Oireachtas\".  In that way it would include Members of the D&aacute;il but also Members and former Members of the Seanad.  That is important because in the last 48 hours we had Deputy Deasy come out, as well as the former Deputy Pat Rabbitte, and Deputy Durkan, all claiming to have heard of these allegations.  Apparently, loads of the establishment party TDs were aware of these allegations but did not really do anything about them.  It is not really understandable why they did not do something about it.  It is, however, appropriate to broaden the reference to them.  Reference has been made to a very good reason why we cannot do so.  However, I do not see why it is appropriate to say \"members of the Government\" but not to broaden it beyond that. <\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 2(d) relates to broadening subsection [p] so that not only garda&iacute; who have made protected disclosures before today would be covered, but also any garda who has made a complaint or allegation which could, for example, be an internal Garda complaint.  If they have been subjected to these kind of smears, they should also come within this tribunal's remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600025#X00200","speaker":"1308"},{"type":"speech","time":1487257500,"counter":130,"content":"<p>The next slot is for Deputy Mick Wallace and Deputy Clare Daly who are sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600025#X00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1487257500,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I welcome the terms of reference.

I recommended two Government and two Opposition representatives on the panel.<\/p><p>I am not so sure that the notion of a sitting Commissioner going before a judge in public will be in the best interests of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The T&aacute;naiste knows very well that I think it would be in the best interests of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if the Commissioner was removed from her office.  As I have pointed out before, section 11(1)(<i>c<\/i>) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 states: &quot;the removal of the person from office would, in the opinion of the Government, be in the best interests of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.&quot;  If it was not in the best interests before now, with the public inquiry going on, it will be even more so.  It is very important that the T&aacute;naiste should think again about whether the Commissioner is left in place because I do not think she is fit for office.<\/p><p>Senior garda indiscipline is not within the remit of the policing authority and I think this is a mistake.  The Guerin report and the Garda Inspectorate have called for the need to address how garda indiscipline is dealt with.  Putting this under the Policing Authority makes perfect sense.<\/p><p>Lastly, I touch on a point raised by Deputy O'Callaghan on politicising offices.  He made the point that for elected politicians to call for the head of the Garda Commissioner is politicising it.  I argue that having the ability to remove the Commissioner solely within the hands of the Minister of the day is an even greater degree of politicisation.  If we are going to establish public trust in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, removing the Commissioner would be a wonderful start.<\/p> <p> Hopefully, change is coming.  I hope the Minister can bring it about and implement it.  We need a new Commissioner from outside the jurisdiction and a change of the Garda hierarchy.  A number of members will be standing down soon anyway and a facility of financial inducement should be put in place to encourage others to go.  We need a clean sweep and different people dictating how we do policing.  God knows there are a lot of really good garda&iacute; in this country who have not got the chance they deserve to influence how we do policing.  Too often, the wrong people have been promoted and that needs to change.  I thank the Minister for her work this week.  Most of us agree that Mr. Justice Charleton is an excellent choice.  I am optimistic that he will do a good job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600025#X00400","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487258100,"counter":133,"content":"<p>We are already on the record as saying we are concerned the issues have been a good bit rushed.  We are a little bit worried about that albeit we hope our worries will not be realised.  It is not the way we wanted it but we are where we are.  I have heard nothing but good things about Mr. Justice Charleton and I really hope he can deliver without our worries coming to fruition.  I echo the points about finances.  I hope he is given the money up front to fast-track this and also that he is listened to in terms of broader recommendations he might have.<\/p>  <p>  We are satisfied that the terms of reference cover the key concerns raised in the protected disclosures of Maurice McCabe and David Taylor.  Those allegations are, at their heart, that there was a campaign to undermine and discredit Maurice McCabe with the direct knowledge of the current and former Commissioners.  Horrible and all as that is and upsetting as this entire episode has been for so many citizens, what is most frightening is the allegation that this was done in order to detract from what he was saying.  What he was saying was that we have a systemic problem in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that the blue wall of silence has only been dented, not demolished.  As a result, we have a second Morris tribunal because the recommendations of the first one and the required cultural changes were not implemented.  We owe it to Maurice McCabe and the other whistleblowers to ensure that the bigger picture is not lost sight of.  That is why we need a radical transformation of how we do policing.<\/p>  <p>  In fairness, the Minister is paying the price for not listening to us a number of years ago.  While Fine Gael and the Labour Party, which was in government and stood over all of this, brought in legislation, it was not enough.  The Minister has already accepted that the recommendations of the justice committee, which we released and which argued for a massive strengthening of the GSOC oversight and the role of the Policing Authority, should be looked at and addressed.  We said that two years ago.  If the Government had done it then, we might not be in the mess we are in now.  It needs to be done now because, glaringly, the independent Policing Authority has been silent in the face of the biggest Garda crisis in our history because it has not been given a proper role of oversight or control over the Commissioner as it should have been.<\/p>  <p>  While I am happy with the terms of reference and I acknowledge very much the Minister's role in extending them, we have believed all along that there were really compelling reasons the other whistleblowers should have been included.  They show an unbroken thread of bullying, harassment and intimidation once they made protected disclosures.  Their input is going to be vital.  Up until very late last night, and I know how late the Minister was up, they were not being included with the exception of the small Tusla allegation in Keith Harrison's case.  I am very glad that they are all now going to be included in the second module which I hope comes sooner rather than later.<\/p>  <p>  We know tribunals cannot investigate matters which could be the subject of criminal sanction.  As such, there must be a parallel criminal investigation in this regard.  It is very worrying that no one is ever called to account for these matters.  I bring the Minister back to what the media say this issue started with, namely the penalty points crisis.  It did not really, but that was one of the things.  The Minister's predecessor and herself put aside funds for GSOC to initiate a criminal or disciplinary investigation against the people responsible for that action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600026#Y00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1487258100,"counter":134,"content":"<p>It was &euro;1 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600026#Y00300","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1487258100,"counter":135,"content":"<p>That was three years ago but the money has not been spent by GSOC.

It is untenable to have a Commissioner who is the subject of hugely serious allegations remaining <i>in situ<\/i>.  It would not happen anywhere else.  By virtue of creating a tribunal, it is in essence being said that her statements are not necessarily being believed.  The idea that she would control the evidence vital for this tribunal to do its work is not acceptable not to mind the fact that no whistleblower will come forward while she remains at the helm.  I am glad the terms of reference are as they are, but it is only a tiny bit of the job we have to do on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600026#Y00400","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1487258100,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak today on this important issue.

We do not want to have to come back here in six months having found that issues have arisen which we did not think through.  I sought to raise that this morning at the Business Committee.<\/p>  <p>  Tribunals are chaired by judges and I wish this one the best of luck, but we do not have a good record with tribunals in this country.  Look at the Flood tribunal and the beef tribunal under Mr. Justice Hamilton and the length of time for which they went on.  Nothing came out of them except white smoke.

He is not mean but lean and clean.  I am sure they are rubbing their hands with glee and saying \"Here we go again\".  They are not going to be on the dole queue for a long time but will be down in the Four Courts making hay while the sun shines.  This is too serious.  There are timescales in place and that is very important but we cannot get bogged down in legal argument and challenges.<\/p>  <p>  There are many other whistleblowers out there who will be encouraged by this to come out.  What will happen then?  Where is the limit?  The Minister is including the most recent one of Garda Keith Harrison but if there are others who are encouraged to come out, where are we going to go?  The Minister has said we must get to the truth and that is certainly the case.  She said the terms of reference will establish a public tribunal of inquiry to get to the truth.  That is in the interests of whistleblowers and garda&iacute;, in particular those against whom allegations have been made, and it is in the public interest.  We all know that.  The truth is vital.  However, are we going to get full co-operation?  I hope we are.  The judge will have full powers of compellability, but if findings are made against certain people, there will be no powers of prosecution.  We will see some people rubbing their hands again.  Their hands will be worn with the amount of rubbing because this will be going on and on with no definite action.<\/p><p> What the people want and what we are entrusted to do is to root out the systemic rot in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  I have the greatest of respect for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its many good members, of all ranks, up and down the country and the work they have done and continue to do.  Bad apples must be rooted out completely.<\/p> <p> I will not refer to the Garda Commissioner N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan remaining in place, but I was disappointed with the appointment process.  We support people from abroad but appointed someone from within.  We have to go outside the country.  There needs to be a clean sweep and we must appoint someone who has had no involvement in Ireland if the current Commissioner is forced out of office or whenever the position becomes vacant.<\/p> <p> A criminal prosecution should happen side-by-side with the tribunal, otherwise the tribunal will be a smokescreen.  Major allegations have been made and people's lives have been destroyed.  It is not acceptable.<\/p> <p> In 2006 the Comptroller and Auditor General's report made recommendations on the costs of tribunals.  It recognised that due to their investigatory nature the cost was difficult to estimate.  It also stated that, nonetheless, good financial management demands that a mechanism be established to make the costs more predictable and transparent, which has not happened.  The report went on to state that one possible approach would be to require the production of a formal public statement of estimated costs, a timescale and milestones at all key stages, beginning with the establishment of the tribunal.  Timescales and milestones have been outlined, but there is no information on costs.  The meters have already been turned on to deal with the enormous costs per hour or word.  It is daft.  The public does not want that.  Is this what we are giving the public in the interests of getting to the truth?  It will be further annoyed.<\/p> <p> As I said, the statement could be updated to take account of significant elements or propose new lines of inquiry.  How will we handle that if it arises?  We must consider the costs and what could be done with the money involved.  Much of the support work at tribunals is done using counsel and there appears to be scope to achieve economies by using less experienced paralegal or professional staff for research and investigation work.  I am not having a dig at my learned colleague, but we have to examine that because our experience has been that costs are a runaway train.  We have to be accountable.  There needs to be a move away from engaging counsel for discrete modules.  We need to implement a scheme of predetermined fee rates for future tribunals which takes account of the certainty of the work of tribunals in determining those rates.<\/p> <p> I have a faith An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but I have no faith in Tusla.  I opposed the children's rights referendum &ndash; I was the only Deputy to do so at the time.  I have been vindicated because look at what we got.  We rushed into different things.  The Taoiseach engaged in silliness when he said he appointed the first Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  He threw the current Minister under the bus during the week, or tried to do so.  The Minister was not in the Chamber yesterday for one word of the debate.  She was here to vote.  I wished her well and complimented her when she returned from her trip to the United States for bringing clarity to what went on and where.  It was a timely reminder to the Taoiseach of where he was and was not, and who he did and did not meet.  It takes two people to meet.  If one has an imaginary meeting, the other person can always say it did not happen.<\/p> <p> Superintendent Dave Taylor is a good Tipperary man and we have all met Sergeant McCabe.  They know what has gone on.  He has been reappointed to his position, which I welcome.  We must get to the bottom of this matter.<\/p> <p> Reference has been made to Deputy Deasy and other Deputies.

The appointments are too political.  I totally agree with Deputy Wallace.  GSOC and its precursor, the Garda complaints authority, were toothless when I went them with my complaint.  They had no powers whatsoever.  Many other people have come to me with similar stories.<\/p>  <p>  I do not want to cause friction with Deputy Howlin because we had enough of that last week, but the Labour Party was in Government for the past five years.

Regrettably, that is what it has turned out to be.  It is a very serious error to proceed on this basis in forcing through the terms of reference without allowing adequate time for consideration of their implications.  The reason for doing this is to put the lid on this episode so that the Government, over the coming weekend, can refuse to answer questions that the public is legitimately asking and hide behind the proposed tribunal.  It is unseemly for both groups to behave in this manner.  It is also extremely disingenuous, given the agreement that was reached at the Business Committee on Tuesday, on foot of a proposal from Deputy Clare Daly to defer a decision on the terms of reference until next week in order to allow adequate consideration and for groups to take legal advice.  This is far too serious a matter to rush it through.<\/p>  <p>  It is inevitable that we will rue the day that this action has been taken in haste.  If one acts in haste it is inevitable that one will repent at one's leisure.  That is what is going to happen.

Paragraph [k] provides that the tribunal is \"[t]o investigate whether Commissioner O'Sullivan, using briefing material prepared in Garda Headquarters, influenced or attempted to influence broadcasts on [that RTE broadcast] on the 9th of May, 2016\".  My concern is whether that would restrict the tribunal if there was another guard who was influencing that process.  Are we narrowing the terms of reference with that language?  Is there a point there or am I just misreading it?  Are we over-restricting the terms of reference in those three paragraphs, that is, paragraphs [i], [j] and [k]?  This is critical because I do not think the Commissioner herself would have been in touch with RTE.  It may have been a senior garda.  Are we restricting the ability of the tribunal to investigate other guards' telephone records in terms of contacts to RTE?  The way I read it, the concern I have, which I would like to hear answered, is that, with the way we have written it, we have restricted the telecommunications records inquiry to the period before 31 May 2014.  When it comes to investigating that critical programme, are we in any way restricted?<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste is shaking her head.  I would like to hear a reassurance in that regard.  Why would that not be read as an instruction to the tribunal only to investigate Commissioner O'Sullivan's actions?  Could legal arguments be made by other parties who would be very interested in this to say that the tribunal cannot investigate their records in regard to what happened in May 2016 because the terms of reference do not include it?  I raise this issue for that one reason.  I know the time has been short and that the T&aacute;naiste has been accommodating, but I still have concerns that we are rushing this.  My concern is increased because of what I have seen in previous tribunals, which I do not have time to state here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600028#AA02600","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1487259300,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Deputy Seamus Healy has two minutes and that concludes the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600028#AA02700","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1487259300,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak.  I also welcome the terms of reference in so far as I have had an opportunity to check them out.  I believe that this is being rushed.

It would have been opportune to allow the Members of the House to peruse and check the terms of reference over the weekend.  This could well create a situation where the terms of reference do not include everything and there may be difficulties down the road.  I welcome that we are having a public inquiry.  The original proposal for a private inquiry - effectively one in secret - was not acceptable or good enough and was effectively a cover-up.  It suggested a cover-up.<\/p>  <p>  We should have a parallel criminal investigation undertaken by an external police force identified by the Members of this House.

I thank all Deputies, particularly those Deputies that are supporting the approach I have taken to the terms of reference.  I have attempted to make them inclusive of the concerns people have identified to me in the various submissions I received from the various parties, Independents and other people.  It was extremely helpful to have the level of detail of those who made written submissions as well.  Not everyone did, but I thank those who did make them.  I believe I have faithfully reflected the main concerns that have been expressed in this House on how we deal with these issues.<\/p>  <p>  I am not in a position to accept any of the amendments.  Primarily and briefly, I would say that the Department is covered by the term \"any other State entities\", Members of the Oireachtas are covered by \"any [other] relevant person\".  That is a clear reference on my part.  I can tell Deputy Eamon Ryan that the reference to May 2014 relates to the protected disclosure.  Those were the relevant dates that the person in question, who was Superintendent Taylor, was the press officer.  That is why those are the dates, which came from Mr. Justice O'Neill.<\/p>  <p>  On the other point that Deputy Ryan made, the terms of reference relating to RTE came from Mr. Justice O'Neill, who had examined all the evidence relating to the protected disclosure.  Based on his examination, he decided that was the appropriate formulation in terms of the particular issue in the protected disclosure.<\/p><p>The terms of reference for that matter are totally linked to the protected disclosure and Mr. Justice O'Neill's assessment of and recommendation on how they should be dealt with.<\/p> <p> Deputy Jim O'Callaghan made a suggestion on costs, which I will follow up in so far as we can do anything.  I will certainly pursue the suggestions he has made and I am sure Mr. Justice Charleton will be equally concerned to do that.  <\/p> <p> A point was made on the media.  The media are included in the terms of reference and it is entirely up to the judge to decide, based on his interpretation of the evidence before him, which media outlets to approach.  It will be at the discretion of the judge to decide how he will deal with many of the points raised by Deputies.  The way in which tribunals of inquiry operate is that the judge decides how precisely to carry out the terms of reference.  The judge will have considerable discretion in regard to bringing in relevant people, how media will be defined and so on.  These decisions will be clearly based on the evidence before him.<\/p> <p> Deputy Mick Wallace made a point on recommendations.  One would expect, based on the work of the tribunal, that the judge would be in a position to make recommendations and this would include policy recommendations in respect of the subject matter of the tribunal of inquiry.  I do not have to repeat what the inquiry will cover.  This issue is built in to the terms of reference.  <\/p> <p> While it would be extremely difficult to do emergency legislation on changing tribunals of inquiry, I will examine whether it is feasible to do so.  Perhaps I will be able to consult the judge on that matter.  My advice to date, however, is that it would not be feasible to do so. <\/p> <p> I will mention a few other points that were made.  The Health Service Executive is included.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600028#AA03400","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487259900,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Is that under paragraph [o]?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600029#BB00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1487259900,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Yes.

The projected number of 4,000 civilians will effectively double the figure and represents a medium-term target of 20% civilians over the next five years.

I fully agree with Deputy O'Callaghan that we must ensure that where civilians can do the work within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na we must do everything possible to make sure that happens.  I accept that, as Deputy O'Callaghan indicated, we are below the international levels in regard to civilianisation.

I do not criticise Garda culture, as that has been done enough this week, but in terms of any organisation, if one can get people in from outside one gets a mix of people within an organisation and that improves it.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda modernisation and renewal programme seems less than overwhelming about the process.  It simply says there will be an increase in civilianisation and that it will be conscious of not developing a two-tier service.  I do not think people should be fearful of that, as civilians and police officers can work hand in hand and complement each other.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Minister confident that the target of doubling the number of civilians will be achieved by 2021?

One cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.  Clonmel Garda station is draconian and unfit for purpose.  As I said, it is an early 19th century building.  The public office is not as big as the Clerk's table in front us in the House.  It is tiny.  It was refurbished lately in small bits.  However, the building is higgledy-piggledy and people are always up and down stairs.  The cells are not fit for purpose.  Interview rooms and meeting rooms are the same.  It does not have the facilities for the garda&iacute;.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's commitment to visit Clonmel.  The site has been acquired by the county council.  The old Army barracks is a very proud site and a very emotional issue for Clonmel.  Some 1,000 incidents per month are dealt with by Clonmel Garda station.  It is a huge district.  It covers Carrick-on-Suir, Fethard and out to Clerihan.  We also acknowledge new recruits that have arrived recently.  More are on their way.  They were badly needed.  There is an excellent Garda workforce under superintendent Willie Leahy and his team.  The building is antiquated.  They are waiting for so long.<\/p>  <p>  There were big hopes when the former Minister, Mr. Alan Shatter, announced the move to the Kickham Barracks site three or four years ago, but nothing has happened.  The Minister is working with the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, as am I, to try to achieve that.  It is part of a public-private partnership along with other stations.  My fear, the fear of the garda&iacute; and the fear of the public I represent in Clonmel and Tipperary is that there are too many projects in that bundle and that other projects might not be at as advanced a stage as Clonmel.  We need a big push.  We have been talking about the Garda all week.  Garda&iacute; need to be supported.

I highlighted how important it was, for example, that we had co-operation on the European arrest warrant and other EU justice and home affairs legal instruments.  We need to continue the level of co-operation we have at present after the UK exits the EU.  The precise mechanisms by which we will be able to do that are not clear at present, but I wanted to highlight how well that has worked.

When I was in London, I also had a separate meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, MP.  Our discussion was very much focused on the common travel area, its importance in the context of the peace process and the need for all parties to re-engage in the political process in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  My meeting with the Home Secretary was very helpful, focusing primarily on the criminal justice issues.

For example, the priority given to the strong and historic ties with Ireland and to maintaining the common travel area is a good thing.

It allows freedom of travel between the two jurisdictions.  It is a unique arrangement.  It is extremely important that we get that across to other member states because Ireland remains an extremely committed member of the European Union.  I met with Mr. Barnier to discuss that and to go into the detail of how it operates.  We have a huge amount of co-operation and we do not see that changing.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the publication of the British White Paper, which provides further details on the issues addressed by the Prime Minister in May.

It further states: \"In future, therefore, the Free Movement Directive will no longer apply and the migration of EU nationals [which we are] will be subject to UK law.\".  I believe those are conflicting priorities.  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that given the interpretation the British Prime Minister puts on the Brexit referendum, it is a mandate to control immigration, as she has stated many times, and that the priority given to links with Ireland will play second fiddle to the commitment to limit EU immigration.

I understand they made representations seeking the extension of the inquiry's terms of reference but the UK Home Secretary, having considered those representations, decided that the terms of reference of the inquiry would not be so amended.<\/p>  <p>  Although in this context, the question of my seeking the extension of a UK inquiry does not arise, as I have indicated on several occasions, should anything emerge from the findings of the Pitchford inquiry that would be relevant to policing in this jurisdiction I will consider it fully and take any action that may be required.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on Tuesday and, as part of their wider discussions, raised with him concerns that have been expressed in the House on matters relating to the Pitchford inquiry.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland agreed to convey those concerns to the Home Secretary.<\/p>  <p>  Allegations regarding an undercover police officer in this jurisdiction were first brought to light in 2011.  A report from the Garda Commissioner at that time noted that no evidence of any criminal activity by that person had been established.  Of course, if there was any evidence, and if anybody has any evidence of criminal wrongdoing, it should be brought to the attention of the Garda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600037#KK00400","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1487264400,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Does it not concern that T&aacute;naiste that four men were in this country operating as undercover British police agents?

I have discussed road safety already today with Deputy O'Callaghan.  I am deeply conscious of the serious issue of road safety and mindful of the increase in 2016 of road traffic fatalities and the consequences for everyone.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have no direct role in the enforcement of road traffic legislation, which is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.  Road traffic legislation is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross.  I am, however, informed that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is working with key stakeholders to introduce the new roadside tests for drugs, which will be known as preliminary drug tests.  It is intended that the provisions will be commenced at the Easter bank holiday weekend.  This will allow time for all stakeholders to prepare for introduction, and will provide a valuable opportunity to highlight the dangers of drug driving over the bank holiday weekend.  Until the 2016 Act is commenced, the Courts Service is not in a position to supply conviction statistics requested by the Deputy as there is no code for the offence of failing a roadside drug test. <\/p>  <p>  I look forward to the introduction of the preliminary drug tests and am confident that these new road traffic enforcement measures will impact positively on road safety.  Road safety is a shared responsibility, in society and across various Departments.  We have to work together in partnership to highlight the dangers and educate the new generation of young men who are vulnerable at the moment, whether it is from drugs or alcohol.<\/p>  <p>  There are regular meetings involving me and departmental officials, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Road Safety Authority to highlight the work being done.  The recent campaign on alcohol and driving, which featured a brave family, was very effective but it will be interesting to see how public attitudes changes as the new drugs legislation is introduced.  I have given details of the commencement of the provisions and there will be further co-operation with stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021600038#LL02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1487265000,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that the legislation is being commenced during the Easter break, which is a time when people engage in different types of behaviour, sometimes excessively.<\/p><p>A study undertaken by the County Kildare coroner showed that in 2014 over 1,300 samples from drivers were analysed for drugs, of which 58% tested positive.  Some 52% were positive for two or more drugs.  We have therefore seen a growth in poly-drug use that is beyond the scope of drug-related issues in this Act.  Drug-related behaviour contributed to many traffic incidents but roadside testing was not intervening.  It is, therefore, positive that the Road Safety Authority and the Department are commencing this testing at an appropriate time of year.<\/p> <p> The Road Safety Authority should ratchet up its own campaign to raise public awareness that it is commencing.

The Government has made it clear that it is committed to introducing legislative change to give Garda associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  We are certainly not resiling from that commitment, as I assured the Garda representatives when I met them.  <\/p>  <p>  In December last, I went to Government and got approval for drafting the heads of a Bill to achieve this objective.  Many different issues fall to be considered in this context.  These include the status of the Garda associations established under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts and the related question of constraints on members taking industrial action.<\/p>  <p>  To assist in the consideration of these, we have a new working group, which is chaired by Mr. John Murphy, the recently retired Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  They will have responsibility for the legislation.  My Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Garda management and the Workplace Relations Commission are represented on the group.  I have asked that group to meet at an early stage with the Garda associations, so that their submissions and views on this matter can be fully taken into account in the work that is going on.  I want to have an effective structure to support harmonious industrial relations within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and which are appropriate to the force.<\/p>  <p>  There are many key issues and if the Deputy would like to make a submission to that group I would welcome it.

It is important to consider how best members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can access industrial relations mechanisms.  They should have that access.  At the end of last year, we faced a difficult prospect for this country when strike action was threatened by a number of Garda associations.  In fairness to them, they probably had to threaten that because they did not have access to the full industrial relations mechanism.  However, it is a difficult and dangerous situation for the public if members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can go on strike.<\/p>  <p>  I remain of the view that section 59 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act precludes members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from going on strike.  There was much debate at the time as to whether or not that was so.

It is critical that we have effective and robust mechanisms in place for industrial relations in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The question of a trade union is one of the key issues but there are a number of other issues we must consider.  Trade union status gives rise not just to a series of protections for such organisations but also to a series of constraints.  The task for the months ahead is to look carefully at what would be appropriate in a policing context.  That is what the working group has been established to consider, given the changed status in regard to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's access to the Workplace Relations Commission and to the Labour Court.  I certainly want to have consultations.  It is also a big societal issue; it is a broader issue than for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na alone.

The former is responsible for the protection of the State, while the latter group is responsible for the administration of justice.  This will all be considered in Mr. Murphy's report to which the T&aacute;naiste has referred, particularly in respect of garda&iacute;.  It is important that the State adopts a position in respect of it.  My understanding of the law at present is that garda&iacute; cannot go on strike.
